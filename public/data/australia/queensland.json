During my 4-year-old's lesson, Charlotte was clearly distracted and not paying attention to the kids. My child slipped off the platform and she didn’t notice until I shouted around three seconds later. Drowning for kids can happen sliently in just seconds, and it's terrifying to think what might have happened if I hadn’t been watching as well. This lack of attention is unacceptable for a swimming instructor.  But other instructors like Stephenie, Sami , whom my child previously had are great.",

Nothing flash but seemed practical if you’re after basics. The change rooms were serviceable, but honestly, they could use a little spruce up; tiles look like they’ve been around since the early 2000s. On the upside, plenty of parking out front, which is rare for these sorts of centres. Prices were fair, especially compared to other spots around Brisbane.

It was an unexpected and charming sight, and naturally, many people, including my five-year-old son, were curious and stopped to watch.\n\nHowever, what should have been a lighthearted and educational moment for the children quickly turned unpleasant when one of the lifeguards suddenly yelled at my son, telling him to go away. This was not only unnecessary, but also quite distressing for a young child. He was not approaching or touching the ducks — merely observing from the side, as were many others.\n\nIf the ducks are protected or if there are specific safety or environmental concerns regarding interaction, this should be clearly communicated with appropriate signage or a calm explanation — not with raised voices directed at young children.\n\nWe fully support the care and safety of local wildlife, but also believe that respectful and age-appropriate communication is essential in a family-oriented environment such as yours.\n\nI hope you will take this feedback seriously and ensure that all staff are trained to handle such situations with more understanding and professionalism in the future.",

I used to attend this pool 7 years ago when I lived nearby, but went elsewhere because the swimming lessons often used to take up whole heated pool. I'm needing some hydrotherapy and thought I'd see if things had improved. I even rang and asked about the schedule/procedures earlier in the day. I was told there would be one lane left for walking/laps - free from ppl playing. I was told after 5:30pm was a good time to come. This was not the case and nothing at all has improved! In fact, it was so much worse and basically a free for all. Not to mention, it's more expensive than other nearby pools. Only one lane on the end was left for public use and was full of adults and kids just mucking around. Kids were jumping in everywhere and parents weren't much better. The swim instructor taking the group in the next lane was encouraging her students to splash and play tag, with no regard for others.\n\nI gave up after 30 mins and tried to enjoy the spa section, only to have a child run and jump from behind, right on top of me. Not once but twice! Hurting my neck and spraining my toe. His mother was very apologetic. I get that kids are kids but honestly why isn't this pool more organised? Other pools post their lane availability online (this one does not) and most have set times for parents and kids to enjoy and separate times for people needing hydrotherapy. I'm so, so cranky. I can't wait for my usual pool to be open again. I realise now it's heaven compared to this pool.",

She was an active listener.\nI always visit this place for swimming because it’s only a 10-minute drive away, and the staff are usually friendly and engaging. I usually don’t rate places, but an incident yesterday left me really pissed. I thought I should bring this to your attention again.\nA 40-year-old Caucasian man approached me in a disruptive manner, requesting we leave the lane for his convenience while I was sharing with a child. The reason given was it was the fast lane, but I explained that I was sharing with others. This led to an argument between us. I refused to move and engage further as I think this abusive behavior cannot be tolerated, so I said to him that I couldn’t understand him. He threatened to get someone to come to me if I refused to speak to him. A few minutes later, a staff member approached me for a conversation. I was extremely upset because he didn’t ask for the full story and instead asked us to move. It was a Sunday afternoon, and many families and children had come for fun. The pool was quite packed. I explained to him that the male was rude and disrespectful. He agreed that he thought the male was rude, but continued to ask us to move. There were two kids around, so they remained quiet. The mother had no choice but to ask them to leave the lane. I tried explaining to the young man by questioning his decision and thoughts, saying that the male couldn’t be an Olympic athlete. However, he accused me of being rude. Later, I saw him circled back to the man and have a brief chat before leaving. The man continued to stay in the lane. I came out of the pool, ran to the staff, and asked him to stop for a conversation. He didn’t respond, so I asked to speak to his manager. The lady was lovely and thought it would be fair for everyone to share the lane instead of the male kept it to himself for his preferences. She said she would speak to the man and offered me a free entry, which I declined. I expressed my gratitude, as I had used the pool before the incident.\nMy point is that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable, especially with children around. It would be beneficial to provide more training for staff on conflict resolution.",

Its no secret the centre management have no interest in the crossfit section of the centre, even though we have the most expensive membership price we are treated like an inconvenience. We are never advertised on the parkinson page, new members are never advised of our existence when they enquire/sign up to the centre and then management wonder why we dont get many new members, which is a shame because we have 2 amazing, qualified crossfit coaches who work with all fitness levels and all the members there are very welcoming and supportive.",

The younger staff members were generally lovely, but there are a few senior staff members who are consistently rude and dismissive, particularly an older female staff member at reception.\n\nI had twin girls who were two years old at the time, and we often had to wait for their four year old brother to finish his lesson. There is a large play area for children, but it was always closed. Every week, without fail, my toddlers would be told off or shouted at for even touching the toys through the small plastic fence. When I once asked when the play area would be open, the staff member snapped at me, “It says closed. That means it’s closed.” This wasn’t an isolated incident. It was the same ongoing rudeness, week after week, from the same person, who still works there.\n\nAnother incident that still stands out was finding a large piece of human faeces in the middle of the girls’ change rooms. I reported it to staff, expecting it to be cleaned up promptly. Instead, it was left there with only a yellow warning sign placed over it. No one removed it for a significant amount of time, which was both unhygienic and shocking in a children’s facility.\n\nThe final incident that made us leave involved a senior staff member who interfered with my parenting. My son had two minutes left of his final lesson and said he was bored and wanted to get out. I calmly told him to finish the last two minutes. The owner stepped in and repeatedly told him he didn’t have to go back in, directly contradicting me in front of my child. Each time I said he needed to finish the lesson, she told him the opposite. My son was left confused and upset, not knowing who to listen to. It was an extremely uncomfortable and bizarre situation.\n\nOverall, it’s a shame, because the lessons themselves were fine and some staff were genuinely kind. Unfortunately, the attitude of a few senior staff members completely ruins the atmosphere of the swim school.",

This pool looks fantastic, the facilities are very clean and the water is a great temp (I’m amazed the heater held up with the 10 degree weather this morning), my only issue is that there seems to be no order with regards to lane availability. The website says there’s 4 lap swimming lanes available most mornings from 5am, but when I swam on Tuesday and Thursday this week, there was barely even one lane available with the squad/program swimmers taking over the designated lap lanes. At one point there were 9 people in a laps lane and approximately 5 of them were squad swimmers, as a total amateur it was a bit stressful to keep up with them so as not to slow them down! I could even see one of them getting a bit annoyed that they couldn’t overtake due to the number of people in the lane. I’m wondering if the website/lane designation is inaccurate or if this is normal pool etiquette for Dunlop? Either way I am keen for Jindalee Pool to reopen.",

In recent years the water quality has been great so whatever changes were made have been well worthwhile.\n\nWe have really appreciated the lessons.

After arriving, we were given a brief tour of the facilities, followed by a membership sales explanation. Up to this point, everything seemed fine.\n\nHowever, when my friends and I expressed that we were not currently interested in signing up for a membership, their attitude toward us noticeably changed. They became dismissive and unprofessional, and as a result, we were not allowed to proceed with the workout experience we had been promised.\n\nWe were clearly informed beforehand that we would be able to participate in a one-day workout trial, and we were instructed to bring water bottles and towels — so we all came fully prepared. Yet, simply because we were not ready to register for a membership on the spot, we were effectively sent out without being able to use any facilities.\n\nThis was extremely disappointing. We did not even have the chance to experience the gym before being asked to consider membership, which goes against the basic expectation of a trial session. Trying the facilities first is a reasonable step for any potential client.\n\nWhile I may not recall their names precisely, both staff members behaved in a manner that felt disrespectful and far from professional. This experience has made us feel uncomfortable, and we would not consider training with them based on how we were treated. Staff members should not react emotionally or treat guests differently simply because they choose not to register immediately.\n\nWe did not receive the service we were promised, and I strongly believe that these trainers should receive further guidance on professional conduct and customer service.\n\nI hope the gym will look into this matter seriously.",

Then there is a big giant red 🦀, a lilac octopus 🐙  a yellow submarine which has tape around it so not meant to be used, this area is for water play n the ground is made to be like rolling waves, but unfortunately there were rocks thrown around n was very messy n unsafe looking n the water wasn't working. Then there is the climbing frame playground which has something for everybody n seems to all interconnect plus a couple more swings. There is so much seating n footpaths for scootering or biking or skating. The ground is uneven, as in going up n down hills n flat ground different types of pathways. The gardens are well developed but need some TLC. There is plenty of parking plenty of tables n chairs n covered area, there is a track leading down to the Brisbane River which has a flat beach like edging.  This place has so much imagination put into it I hope it gets fixed up n used properly again . Oh and a flying fox n heaps n heaps of shade from some beautiful old trees. Plenty of parking",

Very convenient, they have choices of restaurants inside the resort, walking distance to Seaworld theme park, and the facility is clean. We are happy with the service from cleaners, concierge, and reception. Receptionist named Rain was very helpful everytime we have questions or concerns. There was a time when we can’t connect our phone to chrome cast in our tele and they sent and IT to get our connection fixed. They have available towels near the pool that you can borrow which is very convenient. Lots of activities for kids. We lot the appearance of Spongebob and watching a movie in their theatre room. It was a very nice experience and we will be coming back again for sure.",

We had a powered caravan site surrounded by palm trees and sub-tropical gardens. The lawned areas are lush & green. Amenities are spotlessly clean and modern. Laundry facilities were ample with large washing lines adjacent. Pool is clean and well maintained. The park is 1.2km from\nWestfield Mount Gravatt (previously known as Garden City). There are bus stops just outside the park entrance. We stayed for 9 nights and really enjoyed the vibe of the park - beautiful gardens and quite peaceful considering the location near main road. Highly recommend this place.",

I found it great having a washing machine to use in the cabin (that was a bonus) I found the long lost remote control cover for the kitchen light/fan when I moved the lounge to sweep the floor. The only gripe I have is that the air conditioning is inadequate for hot weather, the cabin is blasted by the full sun for most of the day. I had to hang two towels in the kitchen window to try & stop some of the heat from coming in. Luckily I was able to borrow a pedestal fan from my son to place in the doorway from the bedroom (where the air conditioner is located) blowing cool air into the living area to help alleviate the heat. It only just made the living area bearable on hot days.",

Granted the amenities are old but they were always clean, more so than most places we have encountered in our year on the road.\nThe place has a lot of permanents but they were always friendly and nice so not sure what others got all twisted up about. Site we were given was large and spacious and considering you are less than 30mins to downtown Brisbane this is a good place to pull up to explore Brisbane. Supermarket, gym etc are a short walk away as is public transport.",

          "reviewText": "We stayed for 3 nights in sept school holidays 2025 in the holiday stays lower section and after reading many questionable and negative reviews, we were pleasantly surprised 😊 We stayed with our two young daughters and puppy. The amenities were clean, smelled clean and were cleaned every day. The key code to get into the shower/toilet block was working during our stay which was a plus. It wasn’t as loud or unpleasant as we’d read (and heard about) and the pool area was also nicer than we’d expected. Having dogs allowed was a bonus and the locals who lived there seemed nice enough too. I’m sure there are peaks and troughs of unpleasant times but for our long weekend stay we didn’t experience anything negative. The only downside was that we did ask to check in early as we also had family staying there for a short holiday in the site next to ours - they checked in the day before us - also but we're told we couldn't check in early. We assumed it was because the  site was still being used but our family said it was vacant so it left us confused - especially when we noticed many others checking into their site before 2pm. But otherwise it was a pleasant stay. Thanks",

My partner booked over the phone all was very easy and staff were accommodation, when it came to arriving we were sent an email the day before with out site number and the codes for the amenities so we thought all very easy, efficient, this will be fine… how wrong we were. We turned up, no gates on the park so anyone could come in and out as they pleased. We drove past the pool and thought wow this park looks fine but followed the map to our site and realised that was not the case. We were put on site T25 so the furthest right you could get of the main entrance, we pulled up past a few caravans with no wheels on, on cinder blocks, mould going down them and thought oh must just be one or two that are run down but when we took the hill down to our area it seems to be a running theme, already people shouting at each other and their kids, kids running free, partners arguing with each other. Now we didn’t want to judge those there but clearly a few of them were drug users and of the heavy drug variety, now I wouldn’t jump to conclusions if I hadn’t have used our closest amenities block which had the strongest smell of weed coming from it with people smoking outside. Myself and my partner slowly realised we cannot stay here! Now going off the photos online you would think this is a nice up to date looking park but I’m not sure when those photos were taken or if they were even of this park! Myself and my partner slowly looked over the reviews (something he should’ve done before hand, but that was the first and last time he was in charge of booking a site for us) we realised that this clearly was a running theme with most reviews before us! Luckily we were able to get into another holiday park which was stunning and very accommodating (Brisbane holiday village - for anyone needing a recommendation close to the city!). My three words of advice I would give to anyone looking to stay here… 1. Don’t put your partner in charge of the booking! 2. If you do allow him/her to book make sure they check the reviews and 3. Don’t book here at all!",

We paid a decent price and expected to have a room that was of a reasonable standard. At check-in, the owner said the eftpos machine was down so she could only take cash. We thought that was odd as you can still pay with card details. The hairdryer was cracked and broken and didn't work. A couple of the lights were faulty and also didn't work. The interior was old and the carpet was stained. The owner mentioned that there was no allocated car space for each unit so, first in first served! As it was a long weekend, all accommodation was \"no vacancy\". The owner definitely needs some customer service lessons. I would not recommend Arabella Motor Inn.",

It’s incredibly convenient without ever feeling busy or crowded.\nThe facilities were impressive and thoughtfully designed for families. The pools, playgrounds, and recreational areas were modern, well maintained, and easily accessible. There’s truly something for everyone.\nWe were pleasantly surprised by how quiet and relaxing the park was, even during busier periods. The noise levels were minimal, allowing for a restful stay and a great night’s sleep.\nAccess in and out of the park was simple, with well-signed roads and plenty of parking, making the whole stay smooth and stress-free.\nOverall, Sandstone Point Big4 offers fantastic value for money. With its beautiful location, top-notch facilities, and exceptional cleanliness, it exceeded our expectations. We’ll definitely be returning and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality getaway!",

Everything is online and superbly organized. We only had trouble getting in and out with the door code twice, but the vehicle gate code always worked from outside.

Must have beach & camping permits - Rangers patrol regularly. The area is respected by visitors & kept clean... take all rubbish with you. Fire pits available - BYO wood. Cold showers available - bore/brackish water. Toilets are fitted with a timed push-button light, stinky but relatively clean & surprisingly clear of creepy crawlies! Plenty of wildlife roaming - kangaroos, goannas, kookaburras, mozzies on steroids and sandflies; a quick spray of repellant kept them at bay.",

One is an open camping area without numbered sites suitable for camper trailers, and the other side has 14 numbered sites each with a car park which could accommodate 1-2 vehicles.\nWe stayed on tent site #13 which seemed to have one of the larger spaces.\nThe tent section despite being fully booked out was only around half full, where as the open camping area was very tightly packed.  There were some huge groups that looked to be around 20+ people.\n\nFacilities are average quality with 2 cold, salt water showers with little more than a dribble.  There are only 3 toilets which are a \"hybrid\" system.  They were reasonably clean but smelly.  Unfortunately with such large numbers of people on site the toilets were often queued up for.\n\nAccess to the beach area is great and you're able to walk around on the sand to some smaller more secluded mangrove sections.\nSwimming is possible but only when the tide is high.  There's about a 30mt walk to where the water drops off which is knee to waist height.\nFishing looked to be successful for most people giving it a go.\n\nOcean beach is a nice day trip which took us around 40 minutes north through the inland sand track.  Driving conditions are slow (speed limit is only 30 kph ?!?) and the sand can be really soft and heavy going through some sections.  We didn't get stuck but if you happened to there would always be someone coming past soon enough to give you a hand.\n\nThe rangers turned up every day at around 9am which is nice to see.  We've stayed in almost every national park campground in SEQ and they've never been this consistent.   We saw people get asked to leave due to not having bookings or vehicle passes.  Good to see the rules were being enforced and these guys don't mess around.  So do the right thing and get your bookings in order.\n\nOverall we were very happy with the site.  The location is great but these days every bogan and his dog have a 4WD vehicle so it's not exactly a hidden gem.\nWe'll be coming back but more likely to be in the lower season.  Mozzies and Midgies galore around summer so expect to come home with few dozen bites.",

For someone scarred by a history of camping trips that were more ordeal than escape, I came in skeptical, but I left wishing I could stay longer.\n\nThe sprawling 312-acre site offers plenty of breathing room, even on a busy long weekend. The spaces are so well spread out that we could talk loudly around our campfire and blast our favourite tunes without triggering the ire of a neighbouring campsite. Shade is plentiful throughout the grounds, but if you're looking for particularly shady spots within the campgrounds, sites D19-22 are worth checking out.\n\nWe had a big group - ten adults and eleven kids, ranging from 3 to 16 - a loud, chaotic crew with endless energy. But the grounds handled us with no trouble at all. There were bike tracks for the kids who couldn’t sit still, hiking trails for the adventurous, and 1.5 kilometers of creek frontage for anyone needing to cool off or just relax by the water.\n\nThe creek became our oasis, perfect for setting up eskies and coolcabanas while we swam and unwound for hours. Nearby, just a short drive away, Rocky Hole adds to the experience - a beautiful swimming spot carved into the granite gullies of Mount Mee. With cool water and spots for rock-jumping, it’s a favorite for good reason. The off-road track to get there can be a bit tricky - we managed in a Honda CRV by taking it slow, but in wet or muddy conditions, you’ll definitely need a 4WD.\n\nThere are plenty of campfire spots scattered across the Neurum Creek grounds, ensuring most campers can enjoy this essential part of the experience. The site is dog-friendly and well-maintained, with showers and toilets that were impressively clean (even the long drops).\n\nNeurum Creek isn’t just a campsite; it’s a sanctuary to escape from the grind, unplug, hang out with friends and family, and enjoy the outdoors.",

The smell of urine is so bad your nostrils flare up and you can literally taste the it, I would be surprised if the toilets have been cleaned within the year. There is urine stained all over the toilet seats, the sinks are filthy, my partner refused to go in there any time due to the condition. There is also no hot water, this is fine for me as I usually have cold showers, but after about 2 minutes of using the shower and water slows down to the pace of a tortoise and you are forced to endure quiet possibly the worst shower ever.\n\nLike I said overall the horrible bathroom does not ruin the beautiful and well located camp ground. But paying $35 a night I would hope some of that money would go towards cleaning the dirtiest bathroom I have ever encountered. I hope to christ I never find a bathroom dirtier.",

All the play equipment were covered in piles and piles of mulch. This is what it looked like after I had got a lot of it off.",

The management is aware so they ask you to close the door while showering so the alarm is not activated (see photo). Smallest tv in the world (see pic) and remote shows Netflix and all but it's not true, there are only regular chanels. BBQ present but you have to pay $2 per 5mins (forgot to take pic). Requested and paid for queen bed but they attached 2 single beds to each other (really uncomfortable/inconvenient). If you lock yourself out after hours, they charge $100 even if someone is on the premises to open for you. Swimming pool is disgusting, million of whitish stuff floating in it that you don't see at first. It's at the bottom of the pool. Start walking/swimming and all comes up. Definitely don't put your head under water! I think I should stop there, you get it, very disappointed and do not recommend! The only positive thing is the staff been friendly.",

          "reviewText": "This is a cheap and nasty place.\nThe “guests” are almost all men who spend the day smoking, vaping and drinking beer - a few metres from the rooms.\n\nOne complaint is you will be charged more than what you paid online. There is NO city tax in Brisbane but they charge it anyway!\n\nApart from one room, the rooms on the ground floor have no windows and are small and narrow. You are basically sleeping in a cupboard with 2 double bunks.\n\nUpstairs has a very small air conditioner that cools one bed only, so the 7 other beds upstairs are hot. Don’t stay in these beds in summer . Also the beds upstairs are in the same room as the kitchen so it’s noisy and smelly.\n\nThe bathroom downstairs has flying insects and the toilet is gross. The toilet upstairs doesn’t seem to be cleaned regularly.\n\nThe traffic noise is bad as this place is on a six-lane road.\n\nThere is a TV but there’s just one sofa in front of it and men sit on it smoking and drinking so you can’t say this place has a lounge area.\n\nThere’s a grubby “laundry” area but I wouldn’t wash my dog in it. I hung a linen shirt there to dry but I saw the manager take the coathanger and just leave my shirt hanging over the line!\n\nAlso note the top bunks have ladders made from pieces of roughly cut timber screwed together. There are no grab rails so expect difficulty. My bed had a screw protruding into the bunk area!\n\nNeedless to say, cheap sheets and worn out towels - beware they are washed on site and not by a proper laundry. I imagine the washing machines are never cleaned.\n\nThe manager is belligerent and unpleasant. While I was there, he was drunk for 3 days and I found him lying on a bunk without a sheet.  If you insist on staying, buy a can of disinfectant to sanitise your area.\n\nThe “cupboards” in the rooms downstairs are just timber sheets nailed together - not proper lockers and there aren’t enough for everyone. Upstairs, there are only two cupboards with doors that didn’t reach all the way to the top so not secure. People just left their stuff on the floor in the kitchen. One night I could hardly enter the area as cans of beer blocked the passageway.\n\nI wouldn’t use the kitchen and the fridge upstairs smelt badly - uncovered food on the shelves .\n\nOur room had a woman whose odour was worse than I have ever experienced. Another person in our room screamed at snorers and had such a menacing fight with another in our room, that the rest of us ran outside in pyjamas. Then we were locked out of the room by one of those fighting.\n\nThe ineffectual manager of course nothing.  Neither did the owner.\n\nThe manager also has no respect for privacy - he enters rooms at random, even late at night, without knocking. They can also move you from room to room without asking.\n\nI has several things stolen so be aware.\n\nA garden runs alongside the “outdoors” area and some people reported seeing rats but luckily I didn’t see any evidence.\n\nThe only good thing is there a supermarket across the road, a few takeaway shops nearby - and there’s a car park on a vacant lot next door (charges apply). Public transport is handy but it’s about 25 minutes to the CBD.\n\nDO NOT STAY HERE",

The toilet upstairs doesn’t seem to be cleaned regularly.\n\nThe traffic noise is bad as this place is on a six-lane road.\n\nThere is a TV but there’s just one sofa in front of it and men sit on it smoking and drinking so you can’t say this place has a lounge area.\n\nThere’s a grubby “laundry” area but I wouldn’t wash my dog in it. I hung a linen shirt there to dry but I saw the manager take the coathanger and just leave my shirt hanging over the line!\n\nAlso note the top bunks have ladders made from pieces of roughly cut timber screwed together. There are no grab rails so expect difficulty. My bed had a screw protruding into the bunk area!\n\nNeedless to say, cheap sheets and worn out towels - beware they are washed on site and not by a proper laundry. I imagine the washing machines are never cleaned.\n\nThe manager is belligerent and unpleasant. While I was there, he was drunk for 3 days and I found him lying on a bunk without a sheet.  If you insist on staying, buy a can of disinfectant to sanitise your area.\n\nThe “cupboards” in the rooms downstairs are just timber sheets nailed together - not proper lockers and there aren’t enough for everyone. Upstairs, there are only two cupboards with doors that didn’t reach all the way to the top so not secure. People just left their stuff on the floor in the kitchen. One night I could hardly enter the area as cans of beer blocked the passageway.\n\nI wouldn’t use the kitchen and the fridge upstairs smelt badly - uncovered food on the shelves .\n\nOur room had a woman whose odour was worse than I have ever experienced. Another person in our room screamed at snorers and had such a menacing fight with another in our room, that the rest of us ran outside in pyjamas. Then we were locked out of the room by one of those fighting.\n\nThe ineffectual manager of course nothing.  Neither did the owner.\n\nThe manager also has no respect for privacy - he enters rooms at random, even late at night, without knocking. They can also move you from room to room without asking.\n\nI has several things stolen so be aware.\n\nA garden runs alongside the “outdoors” area and some people reported seeing rats but luckily I didn’t see any evidence.\n\nThe only good thing is there a supermarket across the road, a few takeaway shops nearby - and there’s a car park on a vacant lot next door (charges apply). Public transport is handy but it’s about 25 minutes to the CBD.\n\nDO NOT STAY HERE",

It was nice to have bathroom towels in the room, and our room in general was fine. Whilst the room didnt have it’s own aircon control, it was a comfortable temperature. The location of the place is also pretty convenient if you want to get to Roma Street station or surrounding areas.\n\nHowever, I think we were abit unlucky with our room. We had some sort of generator outside our door. We thought it was a big washing machine or something when we arrived, but it continued constantly throughout our stay. There was also quite abit of noise from the bathroom which was opposite too. It felt like the majority of residents didnt respect the quiet hours of the hostel - there was loads of people shouting and running up and down the halls until way past midnight.\n\nBy the end of the night, the kitchen was a bit of a dump and people definitely did not clean up after themselves. It did feel like there was quite a few people living at the hostel, which does affect the feeling of the place.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t recommend it to people for a long period of time, but for a short stay it’s acceptable.",

          "reviewText": "Ok so I stayed in this hostel for a few months and here’s an honest break down. The location of this place is amazing, right in the centre, close to the nightlife and shops Aswell as the metro which is very convenient. Here’s the downsides, the kitchen is disgusting, people don’t seem to know how to clean pans and plates and the cleaners do nothing about it also the opening times of the kitchen are inconvenient if you work nights. The staff for the most part are pretty friendly and pretty chatty. There is not really any social life in this hostel, if you’re travelling and wanting to meet people, this is absolutely NOT the place. Every room I was in had cockroaches in the toilet and shower. The WiFi literally never works and it seemed to be a dead zone for my mobile data, I’d get like 2 bars of signal maximum. The biggest killer about this hostel is how much they jack up the rent, at the end of my stay I was paying around $420 a week and they were trying to increase it to $500! to stay in an 8 person dorm which is absolute insanity!!! If you work full time on a casual contract it’s around half of your weekly paycheck! If you’re a traveller coming to Brisbane looking for a job like I did, do NOT stay here, your money will go insanely fast at this place, there are much cheaper alternatives that offer the same services. All in all, I can’t say I’d recommend this place to anyone, it has a special place in my heart cause I stayed here for months with my friends as we were trying to save every penny we could to move out, however the price can NOT be justified and it’s not a social place at all, so do what you will with this infomation…",

          "reviewText": "Ok so I stayed in this hostel for a few months and here’s an honest break down. The location of this place is amazing, right in the centre, close to the nightlife and shops Aswell as the metro which is very convenient. Here’s the downsides, the kitchen is disgusting, people don’t seem to know how to clean pans and plates and the cleaners do nothing about it also the opening times of the kitchen are inconvenient if you work nights. The staff for the most part are pretty friendly and pretty chatty. There is not really any social life in this hostel, if you’re travelling and wanting to meet people, this is absolutely NOT the place. Every room I was in had cockroaches in the toilet and shower. The WiFi literally never works and it seemed to be a dead zone for my mobile data, I’d get like 2 bars of signal maximum.

Lol\nIf she did her job perhaps amenities could be slightly improved ?\nLazy and careless, selfish visitors don't help in the slightest... im placing bets they don't treat their loo @home the way I've witnessed many people disregard the facilities here...\nCouncil mow & employ cleaners, that do attend 3-4 times throughout the day that ive seen.\nBut the entitled & more wealthy travellers be far too superior of such budget run areas...\nThe resident homesless are naturally guarded towards the judgment of the visiting touring blow ins... who with their  large & cumbersome & visually awkward  manoeuving vehicles around occasionally a very densly populated area.. one can't help but wonder if they may be more comfortable suituating at a paid caravan park facility ... rather than looking down their noses, gazing across the now quite dated location, with a derogatorive deminor & stereotypical assumptions... remembering that the site has been completely submerged in several flood events over the years & still holds a sentimental history for many that frequent regularly 🙂",

What’s meant to be a space for little ones is rundown, poorly maintained, and clearly an afterthought. Several parts of the play area are broken, and there’s next to nothing that actually entertains or engages children in this age range. It gives the impression that it hasn’t been properly cared for or updated in a long time.\n\nWhat’s worse, there’s an emergency exit with a low handle that opens straight into the car park — a serious safety hazard for toddlers. It’s shocking that this hasn’t been addressed.\n\nThe bathroom facilities were also in poor condition — unclean, and out of five women’s toilets, only one had toilet paper. It really summed up the overall lack of attention and care across the venue.\n\nThe staff seem undertrained and unable to manage even simple requests without waiting for a manager to step in, and the café food is inconsistent and low quality. The overall vibe is one of neglect and disorganisation rather than fun and family-friendly.\n\nAnd while the height limit may technically allow kids 7-10 yrs on the Ninja course, the reality is that most can’t even reach the equipment, making it more frustrating than enjoyable.\n\nFor families with younger children, I strongly recommend choosing another venue. There are far better-maintained and genuinely child-friendly places in Brisbane that care about safety, hygiene, and engagement — all things Urban Xtreme seems to have forgotten.",

It really summed up the overall lack of attention and care across the venue.\n\nThe staff seem undertrained and unable to manage even simple requests without waiting for a manager to step in, and the café food is inconsistent and low quality. The overall vibe is one of neglect and disorganisation rather than fun and family-friendly.\n\nAnd while the height limit may technically allow kids 7-10 yrs on the Ninja course, the reality is that most can’t even reach the equipment, making it more frustrating than enjoyable.\n\nFor families with younger children, I strongly recommend choosing another venue. There are far better-maintained and genuinely child-friendly places in Brisbane that care about safety, hygiene, and engagement — all things Urban Xtreme seems to have forgotten.",

Depending on the time you come, there may be squad swimming or training, so just keep that in mind. There is an indoor, heated 14m pool that the children generally play in.\n\nThe staff/ service here is up and down. Some of the staff are great, friendly and hardworking. Others seem to just stand around and don’t even really bother to greet you.",

The whole time it felt like she was just rubbing oil all over me with no purpose. The place was very unorganised. You have to pay for towels, water, everything on top of the massage/spa. I paid to use a towel and wasn’t even given one. When I asked she insisted she already gave me one until she finally remembered she hadn’t. Then she insisted that I give her back the locker key that she never gave me before realising again that she never gave me one. I had to sit up during the massage at one point which was very strange especially as I have done studies in remedial massage and this is not generally normal. Overall so disappointed and am expect  to receive money back because of this.",

There is a hot pool and a cool pool (not freezing like some spas but believe me it feels plenty cold enough after the hot pool or sauna) as well as shower facilities, a lovely bathroom with hair dryer and big well lit mirrors, and lockers. Everything is clean and tidy and the facilities are obviously well looked after. There is also a coffee machine and a little relaxing room with some bean bags. There is no time limit, I stayed about an hour but will come again and relax a little longer. had a tight neck and shoulder when I went in - felt much better after! My only con would be the lighting, it's such a lovely relaxing atmosphere and nice music softly playing but the lights are just those harsh led ceiling lights. Would love to see those turned off and just some floor lamps or something easier on the eyes. But perhaps it's a safety requirements? Anyway absolutely loved it, wonderful value for money, and it's right in the little shopping corner there so even got myself a little snack after. Lovely way to start my day and will absolutely be back.",

We were told to bring towels and our bath products, but not a bathrobe - which would have been handy given there are no specific instructions on what attire is required outside of the spa area: are you required to sit on a towel on the chairs, or can you sit on it whilst nude and the chair unprotected?\n\nLastly, the staff members I dealt with were really not great. Poor customer service, confusing, bordering on rude. I was treated like an idiot or difficult, while the staff member tried to up-sell another client on a massage while in the middle of getting us checked in.

I felt very welcome from the outset.\n\nI was impressed by the attention to the details throughout the service from end to end. The robes and blankets were silky soft. The products smelt and felt amazing. The heat pack was such a nice touch, particularly in winter.\n\nWith regard to the service itself, the massage and wash both were equally enjoyable and relaxing. I was pleasantly surprised at how long the head, neck and shoulder massage went for. Perfect pressure for the massage and a range of tools and techniques were used throughout the wash.

Its a joke that I have to pay to watch over my own children as they swim. How dumb! Also the younger kids pool inn the covered area has no public access in the afternoons all the way thru to 7pm and the centre closes at 8, this is ridiculous . Y not keep even just a small section or a lane for free swim for the public while the lessons are on . Its stupid because they allow one lane of the smaller outside pool for free swimming to the public however one of my children can only stay on the ramp as ots way too deep for him amd the other is struggling too to keep his head aboulve the water level when standing in the shallow end of  the lane that they are all shoved into with every other public swimmer who is at the centre.",

Canteen with limited hot food. There is about 7x picnic covered areas around the pool. First come vasis no bookings. Party catering can be arranged with the canteen. Water is clean and facilities well kept. It gets busy so parking is a little congested. There are power plugs.",

For 3 hrs straight they did not stop swimming, except to do the cake. We actually had the whole aquatic centre  to ourselves, due to the weather. It was awesome.\n\nI highly recommend this place for a kids birthday party. So grateful to Chris who went above and beyond to make sure my sons birthday party was perfect and also the other staff members (lifeguards) who were super friendly, very helpful and great with the kids. We will definitely be going back.",

We chose this place not just because we live in the neighborhood, but also because of its cozy environment, the water playground where kids can play after the lesson, and the great playground outside the pool. My older daughter, who is 9, learned how to swim here when she was little, and I remembered how friendly the staff were. However, this time, the experience was completely different.\n\nAfter a year of swimming lessons, we decided to stop because my son had completely lost interest. Throughout the year, the lessons were taught by the same instructor, with exactly the same activities in the exact same order, which didn't engage my son. Additionally, we had a total of four makeup lessons that needed to be scheduled before our contract ended. When I called the reception, the lady informed me that I had to book all my makeup lessons before my contract ended, which was within two weeks. However, when I tried to make the bookings, she said the classes were all full. She suggested I call at 7 am that morning to check for any cancellations. Despite another lady already booking me a lesson, she later said my son couldn't attend because it was outside of our contract date, and we weren't covered by their insurance anymore. Essentially, one of the booked makeup lessons had to be canceled by her. So makeup lessons needed to be booked before our contract ended because we weren't covered by insurance, but if the classes were full, we couldn't attend. She kept repeating that this was in the contract.\n\nThis left me thinking about their customer service experience and their policies buried in the fine print. They didn't offer me a solution, and their \"this is what it is\" attitude was frustrating. I even considered calling to offer to cover the insurance for us to continue using the pool after our contract ended if that was their concern. However, in the end, I didn't bother to call as I found it too frustrating.",

There are great facilities nearby including showers, toilets, and shaded areas, and it’s beautiful both day and night. Sunrise and sunset here are incredible, and the vibe is always welcoming, whether it’s families, tourists, or locals enjoying the coast.\n\nPerfect for a beach day, a morning jog, or just sitting back and taking in the view.

It was lunch, and there were only 3 other tables occupied when we arrived.  Ordered meal, bought drinks and enjoyed the view.  After approx 35minutes and watching later arrivals receive their order's, a polite request was made as to where in the cue were we.  Meal turned up 5 minutes later which to say the least, was average, however you don't expect cordon bleu for $22.50 small plate.  On our way out met the manager and expressed our disappointment  about our experience in his club, which he swatted off with an off the cuff remark.  I think we'll stick to some tastier options, one of which is about 2km north.",

Great for both the big kids and the littlies\n\nThe family studio cabin was incredibly welcoming upon arrival. It's beautifully styled and seemed almost brand new. The bedding configuration was a bit strange however. The bunks are located next to the door and on the event you use the trundle you would be unable to use the door unless you're climbing over/on top of whoever is asleep on it as it pulls out across the access.\n\nThere are multiple playgrounds with a specific toddler dedicated one which was great. The water park was closed for maintenance which was a little disappointing. However, there were many other water play options such as the 3 different pools you can choose from.\n\nI would have liked there to be information easily found for things like the pedal go karts, mini golf etc as there is nothing in the welcome check in brochure or near the activity themselves that explains if they cost money , how long you can use them etc.\n\nAll in all the NRMA treasure island resort was well worth the visit. Will be back again!",

          "reviewText": "I recently stayed at Turtle Beach Resort and left feeling disappointed. While the pools were enjoyable and the kids had a great time, several issues overshadowed these positives.\nDuring our week-long stay with five people, we quickly ran out of washing detergent by Day 4. When I approached the front desk for more, the lady at the front was not helpful and insisted that we pay $2 for each additional detergent. If this is the resort’s policy, that’s fine—but it should be clearly stated upfront or build into the extra dollar or two into the  price. Charging extra for such basic items is not worth the reputational damage and leaves guests feeling nickel-and-dimed.\n\nAnother serious concern was the ensuite bathroom door in our room (Room 104). When closed, the door could not be opened from the inside, which is a safety issue and still needs to be fixed. This was extremely unsettling (as you can't get out from the inside) and should be addressed immediately.\n\nTo be fair, the staff were friendly, but these issues really detracted from the overall experience. The resort has potential, but policies like charging for basic supplies, lack of replenishment, and maintenance problems need attention. I hope management takes these concerns seriously for the benefit of future guests.\n\nCheers\nKell",

They go above and beyond and truly lovely.\nThe pool, splash pads etc are wonderful we swam every day.\nThe restaurant/Cafe is so convenient and serves amazing coffee and lovely food - their pizza is delicious.\nWe stayed in a 2 bedroom family suite that had some minor imperfections (could use some touch up paint) but overall was clean and very comfortable. We loved having a large space to relax, full kitchen and a laundry means we dont have a huge pile of washing when we get home.\nWe had a ground floor apartment that opened up on to the restaurant and pool area - it was fabulous.\nThe beds were really comfortable but if you are a light sleeper you can occasionally hear the people above you moving their chairs (but not talking/constant noise).\nAs mentioned in owners other comments these are self contained so bring some extra toilet paper, garbage bags, dishwasher tablets and laundry powder (they comp a couple of sachets) - there is a woolworths conveniently located a few doors down you can walk to.\nOverall we had fantastic time and we will definitely visit again!",

I honestly don’t understand how such a simple task can be done so badly. We even had to walk to the front desk every day to pick things up, which takes about six minutes round-trip—far, inconvenient, and ridiculous.\n\nNext, we kept getting woken up every morning by the heat and constant noise. There were loud wild animals everywhere and aggressive birds. The room only had one standing fan, and the actual conditions were nothing like the photos on their website.\n\nBut the most outrageous part happened on our checkout day. They refused to help us transport our luggage from the campsite to the pickup area. They told us to drag our bags across that horrible road that would definitely ruin the wheels. We had already asked in advance if they could help, and they said OK, yet on the morning of 26 Nov, Michelle simply said no. This was a task that would’ve taken them less than a minute, but they still refused. We ended up calling a taxi and asking the driver to drive into the campsite just to help us load our luggage.\n\nThen, as soon as the car went up, they blocked the road to move sheep. When we came back down, they blocked it again—this time for only three sheep—and told us to wait five minutes. By then it was already past the checkout time, and we had to pay extra to the taxi driver for the delay. If this is how your lousy company treats guests, it’s no surprise if you go out of business. Absolutely not recommended. If you don’t have a car, you’re basically screwed.\n\nAlso, the farm claims to have many activities, but most of them require extra fees and the facilities are extremely run-down. In short, don’t come here—ever.",

Had some cover from the trees to keep us dry in the rain aswell.",

Great facilities, has all you need, showers, toilets, kitchen with PowerPoint's, nice undercover lounge area with heaps of board games. Lots of trees and wildlife, even the other campers are very friendly. They have cabins, areas to pitch a tent and for caravans too. They're very involved with the people that stay, they even had a Halloween best dressed tent competition happening. Just a lovely place all round, so glad I went.",

The amount of shells along the shore was incredible.\n\nPam was wonderful to deal with when booking—so helpful and friendly—and the couple who checked us in were just as lovely. The amenities were clean and well maintained.\n\nThere’s no pool or kids’ activities, but honestly, you don’t need them with the beach right there.

A lot more than we would normally pay however the amenities, the BBQ area and pool were all spotless. The on-site managers Sharon and Chris were welcoming and personally maintained the amenities to a very high standard. The park backs onto the Beechmont Hotel where we had lunch with friends on both Saturday and Sunday. It is a 1 hour walk or 5 minute drive to Hinze Dam. Whilst the park is mainly permanents they were very friendly and even invited us to Happy Hour. Very close to the Gold Coast if you want to stay somewhere less”touristy”",

After all, we were not as well organized as expected! I can understand this response since this place is immaculately organized! The grass is kept short, the facilities are spotlessly clean and tidy. The showers are spacious, and every day, new floor towels are provided! The same caretaker (owner?) who first showed some grumpiness turned out to be very kind and helpful. She noticed that I love photography and turned up the following morning with a large cup filled with seeds for me to use, to attract birds to facilitate my attempts to take bird photos! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this quiet and safe place. The only thing I missed were dedicated recycling bins. We ended up taking our rubbish with us to recycle most of it at our business (we have separate recycling bins for cardboard and aluminum cans/glass/plastic). Perhaps this is the last step to organizational perfection for this lovely caravan park!",

Not only that, this place was absolutely filthy, dust everywhere, stench filled, and the sheets are in the state of unwash for ages, covered in dust (and ants of course). Our findings shocked us and we were afraid to inspect under the sheets.\n\nWe tried cleaning up so that we’d feel more comfortable staying here but it wasn’t enough for us.

It's a pretty decent hostel, I have dorms and private rooms, a small pool, large communal areas and a kitchen. I usually stay in a private room, they are small but comfortable with everything you need, single bed, lamp and small desk.and chair. The only reason im not giving it 4 stars is because the last few times I've stayed there the showers in the main downstairs facility are always cold. Not a huge issue but its nice to have a choice of temperature.\nI will be back to stay regardless as I fly out early for work and the convenience of locations is ideal.",

It's a pretty decent hostel, I have dorms and private rooms, a small pool, large communal areas and a kitchen. I usually stay in a private room, they are small but comfortable with everything you need, single bed, lamp and small desk.and chair. The only reason im not giving it 4 stars is because the last few times I've stayed there the showers in the main downstairs facility are always cold. Not a huge issue but its nice to have a choice of temperature.\nI will be back to stay regardless as I fly out early for work and the convenience of locations is ideal.",

We were apprehensive before arriving at this hostel and after staying 4 nights (too long) it was not for us, we would never do it again. Hated it.\n\nTo sum up its pros:\n- Breakfast included + occasional free dinner\n- Plenty of bathrooms and showers to use, the kitchen was also big and easy to work around others when cooking.\n- Location was decent, close to the tram.\n\nHowever we specifically didn't like the following:\n- Not couple friendly.\n- The showers have flies, disgusting.\n- The room for two people was tiny, there was barely any room to move or organise your belongings at the same time without hitting each other.\n- There is barely any storage spaces in the \"private\" room, they give you two pull out boxes under the bed. But no real room to house your suitcases or backpacks. Their suggestions is to leave it in a storage luggage area (a disorderly \"pile\") under CCTV, that is next to the 130 person pod. We didn't feel comfortable doing so.\n- Sleeping was challenging, I still feel tired writing this review. It's important to note, the private rooms you can book are joined next to the 130 capsules, which we didn't realise until we paid and arrived. People are very inconsiderate, taking phone calls in the corridor, watching videos without headphones after 10pm. As well as this, as you're practically in one massive room (separated by plywood walls) you share a floor and can hear everyone stomping past, causing the bunk beds to shake.\n- Once again as you're in a massive room, the lights in the day are dim and we couldn't see anything even with the tiny clip on lights provided in the bunk beds. At night the lights remained on and our bunks lacked curtains so it was very hard to sleep without lights shining in our faces.\n- There's no aircon, just several massive fans in the massive room of 130 pods. Weirdly I woke up freezing in Australia... in summer. They gave us no blankets just a sheet and around 3-5am I would consistently wake up shaking from being so cold.\n- As short stay travellers it was hard to gauge who was staff and who was there as a guest. Multiple people we thought were like us just staying for a short time, we ended up seeing cleaning around the hostel. It didn't feel like a traveller hostel.\n- The long stay guests seem to treat the hostel like their own home, putting music videos like Ibiza Beats with an AI bunny on. a throne at 8am on the telly. Weird. It just didn't make you feel like you could sit down anywhere, instead more like you were in someone else's living room.\n- I overheard an inappropriate, stereotypical \"mens locker room chat\" in the kitchen (a common room) by what I thought was a guest but turned out to be a member of staff. As a female traveller it made me feel quite icky that I was sleeping at this hostel.\n\nFundamentally, our main issue with this hostel is that we felt misled about the description of the room advertised. They stated it would be a private room with a shared bathroom, and our room had no ceiling. When you say a room is private the assumption is that the room is private in all 3 dimensions INCLUDING THE CEILING.\n\nMinus the shackles this is what I imagine Swedish prison to be like, they even summon you on the tannoy for your dinner on Weds/Sat.\n\nWe do not understand how this hostel got a HOSCAR or a 4.8 google review. Either we must be snobs or everyone else is just delusional.",

The shared kitchen was in an awful state: dirty counters, unwashed dishes piled up, and a generally unpleasant smell. The communal toilets were no better — they were filthy and really uncomfortable to use.\n\nOverall, the hostel had potential, especially with the design and layout of the Deluxe Rooms, but the lack of cleanliness and poor maintenance ruined what could have been a great experience.

It felt a bit strange and as if the bartender was annoyed at the manager for keeping us waiting.\n\nThe check in process consists of a thorough explanation of facial recognition law as the front door is unlocked by scanning your face. The manager was nice and friendly.\n\nThe room was spacious and beds were comfortable. I don't think the bathroom had been cleaned as the toilet seat was up, there were a few hairs in the sink and the shower floor had rubbish on it. There was also a smell of vomit and bleach.\n\nSome of the other clientele are... interesting. It was less a backpacker vibe and more halfway house. We were woken up very early by what sounded like a wild bore going ballistic down the corridor. I still don't know what it was, my guess would be someone rattling the metal shutters of the managers office.\n\nFree breakfast was appreciated, it's mainly cereal packets and tea/coffee. There are also some deals on food downstairs at the bar.\n\nLocation is good as it's just down from the beach. We got a twin room which is advertised as having a parking space, but it's actually just parking at the bottle shop which is first come first serve. Luckily we were able to get a space after a few hours but would have been annoying to pay for on street parking.\n\nOverall just a very strange vibe.",

Karli began with a full explanation about what was going to happen throughout the session which in our case was a Full body massage, facial, foot mud mask followed by a soak in the magnesium spa. The treatment room was large enough for the 3 of us to comfortably be in the 1 room, it was sparkly clean, perfectly heated and fresh robes and towels were supplied. We all loved the treatments, feeling relaxed and pampered before heading to the magnesium spa.. we're all over 60 and feel the achy muscles of age and having the soak in the spa was a perfect way to end the session.\nWe walked out feeling pampered, spoilt and relaxed. Will return here everytime I come to the GC. Thank you Karli for looking after us and spoiling us for the time we were at RejoovMe ❤️🥰",

We have taken visitors to the pool and I still attend adult squad there. Coaches and staff come and go sadly, but the team there at present are pleasant, friendly and so very helpful. They work so well together. Special mention to current Coach Murphy and staff, who I generally see, doing the early morning squads. Professional, communicative and knowledgeable coaching often followed by very good coffee! It is also nice and reaffirming to have consistency in our coaching team! So give adult squad swimming a go early morning, mid-morning or evenings. Just check with the staff on times. Or if that is not your go, there are plenty of other activities to enjoy. At least wander in and try the coffee!",

          "reviewText": "I'm compelled to respond to a previous review where allegations that an off duty staff member from Nambour Aquatic Centre was trying to remove any item from a patron's personal bag and then ran away.\n\nI empathically and categorical state that this is a false accusation that has not a semblance of truth. I and others in the 25 metre pool where well aware of the circumstances of this incident both prior and after this event took place. At no stage was this off duty staff member attempting or had the intension to remove or steal any item from this patron's bag for personal gain.\n\nFor anyone to have the pertinacity to make such allegations without spending a minute or two to realise an honest mistake was made, is unfair. It is wrong to attempt to tarnish the reputation of another without taking the time to realise it was an honest mistake. It was easy to quickly ascertain that this patron's bag was picked up mistakenly, rather than that of another bag which was placed directly beside her bag. To then write a review making false allegations, is a result of haste and misrepresentation when describing the events.\n\nI will outline with specificity what I witnessed and had occurred before and after this event took place. I requested the off duty staff member to do a favour by passing my swim gloves to me as I had left them in my swim bag. I had wished to show another patron what they looked like and how to use them to do shoulder and arm strengthening exercises. I pointed to my bag so the off duty staff member could remove my swimming gloves from my bag and pass them to me, however the patron's bag was directly beside my bag which contained my swim gloves and was picked up mistakenly instead of mine. I heard the patron call out to the off duty staff member, and I realised the wrong bag was picked up, and immediately let the off duty staff member know that my bag was the bag beside the one she had picked up. The off duty staff member apologised to the patron, removed the gloves from my bag and got back into the pool and handed the gloves to me. Unfortunately completely by accident the patron's bag was inadvertently picked up, as it was mistakenly deemed as belonging to me.\n\nThe accusation from the patron that a staff member said ''sort of sorry and ran away'', is blatantly false. There was a clear apology made for mistakenly picking up the wrong bag. There was certainly no running away, or moving away from the area, as the gloves were passed to me by the off duty staff member as she got into the 25 metre pool where the patron was also exercising.\n\nI'm incensed that a false accusation of this nature appeared in a review on this platform. I would suggest this patron in future take the time to ascertain the circumstance of the event before making allegations, as stated there was no intension to remove or steal any item from her bag. It was a simple and honest mistake, after I requested this staff member who was not on duty, to assist me by removing my swimming gloves from my bag. There was no impropriety on the part of the off duty staff member at all, rather an honest mistake made when trying to do a favour for me. The staff member who was mentioned, had no bad intention whatsoever, there was no ''running away''. There certainly was an apology, and it was clearly evident to me and others that the patron's bag was picked up mistakenly for another bag. The truth of the situation should have been realised very quickly, as it was obviously an honest mistake.\n\nI have been a patron of the Nambour Aquatic Centre for decades,  and I have known the staff member mentioned for at least 9 years. They have always been honest and kind in their dealings with other patrons when both on and off duty. As you would understand this has been very distressing for this staff member to have to now deal with a negative review such as this, and put under scrutiny, and for other people to possibly question her character and good intensions, is very saddening.",

We found a seat on the stairs and put a towel around us to have some morning tea.\n\nThe water feature was a great treat for our toddler to run in and out of safely.\n\nThere are surrounding cafes and we got some fish and chips and sat under a tree on the grass watching the ibis population.\n\nA great family area, glad we visited.",

          "reviewText": "Tried out Goodlife Community Centre recently and it has a lot going for it. The location is great, the staff are genuinely friendly, and there’s plenty of parking. But there are a couple of things that would stop me from joining unless they change.\n\nThe afternoon/evening hours for the gym and pools are too limited for anyone who works a normal 9–5 job and wants to come in after work. Not everyone wants to train or swim in the morning before work. If both the pools and the gym were open until at least 8pm, people would be able to get in a workout and a swim after work.\n\nThe other issue is the undercover pool, which only seems to be available for classes (not general swimming or doing laps). This is especially an issue during the day, when the uncovered pool is fully exposed to the sun. Some people want shade so they don’t get fried while swimming.\n\nIf the centre extended its evening hours and opened up the undercover pool for general/lap swimming, it would be a much more practical option. Until then, I probably wouldn’t sign up.",

We have travelled along the east coast and visited dozens of AF gyms along the way. AF Maroochydore was our consistent gym for 5 months whilst we worked and unfortunately it was definitely the worst gym we’ve visited. This gym doesn’t even come close to most of the other AF gyms we’ve used along the east coast. There is a huge lack of staff presence and community that the other AF gyms seem to have as well as just a lack of equipment, space and positive atmosphere. The music system was out of use for the whole 5 months we used this gym and little details that ALL the other gyms provide such as free deodorant, period products, hair bands, body wash and access to hairdryers and hair straighteners were non existent here. The assumption I can make is that there is either a lack of regard for gym users here or this gym is under funded. One thing I would say is a unique benefit of this particular gym is the outdoor HIIT area and the bathrooms were for the most part kept clean.",

Note; no cabins there.\n\nThe park was refurbished not so long ago and was recommended by a neighbour, so we decided it was time to try it out.\n\nFacilities are well designed  and maintained and each site has a good concrete slab. The location is terrific; close to the beach, patrolled swimming, the Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club, a good cluster of shops, cafes and restaurants, some with nice sea views. There is a Coles supermarket within a comfortable walking distance if you want to combine walks and light grocery shopping.\n\nOn some evenings, cafes provide local entertainment, adding a nice atmosphere to dining out. One evening, we discovered the Sunset Markets (5-9pm 1st and 3rd Saturdays each month). There are some great food stands and a mix of other temptations, including vinyl records.\n\nSo, all up, we had a pleasant holiday with few car trips.",

For the next two nights, we stayed in the Greyvillea cabin, which was similar in size and amenities but without the views. That said, it was conveniently located near the pool and came at a significantly lower price (over $100/night cheaper), making it a great value option.\nBoth cabins were well-equipped with excellent kitchen facilities—dishwasher, microwave, full-sized fridge, and complimentary coffee and tea. Everything was clean, modern, and family-friendly.\nThe large pool was the highlight for our kids (and us!). With a gentle gradient depth perfect for little ones and super fun water slides that even adults can enjoy, it kept everyone entertained for hours. Plenty of sun loungers and pool towels made relaxing easy.\nWe loved grabbing our morning coffee from Tom and Andy’s coffee cart, which had lovely water views. The resto bar overlooking the pool was another great touch—you can even order food and drinks poolside without leaving your lounger!\nOur kids had an absolute blast, and we made some truly special family memories. Having visited several holiday parks up and down the east coast, this one stands out as the best we’ve experienced so far.\nWe’ll definitely be back—and next time, we’ll be booking well in advance!",

We reported it on day one and the lovely lady was going to get on to it straight away but unfortunately it didn’t help the smell. Great location",

The location is beautiful of course as it is right on the beach.  The office staff very helpful and friendly. The park was fully booked except for one slab we saw that was right alongside the entrance driveway, so not great. More of a car park spot than a holiday spot. In fact most of the camping spots we saw were really small and everyone packed really tightly in side by side with no real privacy. I reckon you could easily hear your neighbours snore at night. We have been to lots of caravan parks, and this is one we will probably never choose because $80 a night is way too much for a plot size that would be the absolute minimum. Even for the very experienced, fitting a caravan into allocated spot would be almost impossible if the others were full around you. Did not check the shower blocks and laundry eymtc but no reason to think they would be bad. The park clean and tidy and well kept.",

EG. the soap dispenser was empty, paper towels ran out and toilets needed cleaning.\n\nThe campsites by the river, whilst having a really beautiful outlook, are fairly poor in comparison to the many other camp sites we’ve stayed at, including in the Noosa Shire. They are not on level ground so for those of us who camp a lot, we know how it is when you and your camp mattress keep slipping down a slope to the edge of the tent. Not ideal. There were also exposed trees roots which again make tenting a challenge (remember the fairytale of the princess and the pea - same principle with tree roots 😊). I think that these issues could be rectified fairly easily, perhaps with small timber retaining walls and sand to build up the sites. 🤷‍♀️\n\nAs I wrote above, we would definitely come back as the location is excellent and the river views beautiful.

It does have a nice view as a positive note. But it is not conveniently positioned. In general we found the camp to lacks on services and amenities. Also, no possibility of paying by card for the laundry machines. Compared to other camps definitely on the lower end.",

The rooms are clean in my experience, they have liquid soap (which is becoming increasingly standard, so that's good to see), and there's plenty of space for the number of people in each sized room.\n\nThat said, this is not a quiet hotel. The soundproofing will block quiet noise but does nothing against anything loud, so if you have a family next door you won't be sleeping. The tiling on the bathrooms is extremely slippery when wet, which concerned me when my wife almost fell in the shower. We found some of the electronics not working, like the bedside lamps, so those aren't checked frequently. There is also no drinkable water unless you upgrade to a Kitchenette, so you're given a single bottle of water as a \"gift\" (They really call it that). The Kitchenettes are ok if you do get one, but they're not equipped enough for anything special.\n\nThe staff are also not the best. They are approachable but clearly tired and not very competent, almost as if they have a script of pre-generated responses in their head and just cannot help you if you leave it. We left an item in the room, told them exactly what it is, what it looks like, where it would be, and that it was so recent the cleaners may have not even come yet, and you could see the confusion on their face as they asked what we mean at every single step. We weren't even speaking very fast, and they weren't typing anything either. We did not get the item back.\n\nOverall I could see this being a good spot for a family if they need a decently cheap place, but this is nothing special and I would not call it 4 stars at all.",

We had a garden view room with queen and single beds and it was specious, clean and comfortable with enough storage and comfy beds. Buffet breakfast was amazing with lots of choices. The other facilities included swimming pool (towels provided), spa, very well equipped gym, kayaks etc were also great. On-site food, drink and snack options were good as well. Additionally, resort grounds were amazing with variety of Australian wildlife like kangaroos and some exotic birds and a nice walking track around the lake. Overall resort staff was very attentive and super friendly. Definitely recommended!!",

Check in is at 2pm.  Ok two drink vouchers given.  Our room wasn’t ready finally ready by 4.30pm.  Rooms were dated and old but mostly clean.  Buffet breakfast is good - good range and an omelette station which hit the spot.  Saturday and Sunday were extremely busy.  Our room didn’t get serviced on Sunday and even when they said they couldn’t accomodation our clean and asked for towels they didn’t deliver them.  Same with the next day, got to 2pm and I called again reminding them our room hadn’t been cleaned again.  They came at 4.45pm.  Resort is run down, pool is small.  Everyone and their kids were on the pool over the weekend and even when some teenagers were doing bomb dives off the deck into the pool no one stopped them.  We went a few years ago just as a couple and had a similar experience.  Sadly, not what it once was. Day trips to Ginger Factory, Australia Zoo and the Aquarian was what made the trip in the end.",

Once we arrived, the campground was absolutely worth it.\n\nThe facilities were clean and well-kept – kitchen, laundry, and bathrooms all tidy (a little sand left in the showers, but that’s totally expected being right by the beach). The location is stunning: peaceful bush sites, spectacular beach access, and incredible views. We enjoyed both sunset and sunrise right on the beach and even spotted a few kangaroos while heading down for sunrise in the morning.\n\nOur powered site was tucked away in the bush, private and relaxing. The whole experience was restful, quiet, and everything we hoped for. No issues or concerns at all.\n\nHighly recommend Noosa North Shore Beach Campground to anyone wanting to escape the crowds, connect with nature, and enjoy simple, relaxing, beachside camping.",

Waking up to the sound of the ocean and watching the sun rise over the waves was nothing short of magic. The sites are well maintained, spacious, and feel tucked away enough to enjoy some privacy while still being part of a friendly camping community.\n\nAmenities were clean and reliable, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Whether you're into fishing, beach walks, or simply relaxing under the stars by the fire, this place delivers. It's also a great base to explore Noosa and the surrounding national parks.\n\nHighly recommend for solo travellers, couples, and families.

And within 12 hours of checking in we had an email stating “no hanging things from trees and no grey water collecting”. Felt a bit overkill.   🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nAnyway… it was very windy (40 km/h) and we had a little rain, but this aided it to being a cool camping experience. We had a few times when we braved the wind and had fun swimming in the 1m depth water and catching a few fish in the Lake. Even with the wind, we managed to catch a few small bream and whiting - so definitely wet a line whilst there.\n\nCan have own fire pits and dogs are able to attend (we loved meeting Doug the Dog) so all in all a great experience.\n\nWould love to come back on a less windy weekend. Very good for families and kids - safe and friendly. Thanks!",

Check in was seamless and they seemed genuinely pleased to have campers around. There are lots of sites to choose from, and most are well spaced with a green, grassy feel. Amenities are great, with a couple of amenities blocks that have clean, coin operated hot water showers (one dollar coins). The amenities blocks were clean and everything was well maintained.\n\nLocation is excellent, only about 10 minutes drive into the town of Kenilworth, which is a beautiful little town well worth exploring. There is a nice atmosphere and plenty of cafes and shops to check out while camping nearby.\n\nIf you stay there, you should also check out Booloumba Falls in Conondale National Park (you need a four wheel drive to access Booloumba Falls, or Booloumba Creek is accessible for any car). It is a lovely waterfall and creek walk with swimming holes near Kenilworth. It is a great day trip from Bluff Creek.\n\nVerdict: Definitely a recommended stay. Lovely setting, good amenities, very friendly hosts.",

The atmosphere was super friendly and familiar—perfect for relaxing and enjoying nature together.\n\nThe facilities were great: clean toilets, hot showers (so good after a day out), and plenty of firewood for a cozy fire in the evening. The views were stunning, especially around the two beautiful lakes where we chilled out and took in the peaceful surroundings.\n\nThe location is also really convenient—just a 20-minute drive to Mooloolaba, and really close to the TreeTop Challenge. Whether you’re into outdoor adventures or just want a quiet escape, this place has it all.\n\nThe owner was incredibly kind and welcoming too, which made the experience even better. Highly recommend—can’t wait to come back!",

Bathroom was recently renovated but had some issues with shower head spraying all through the bathroom when door was open to adjust water for kids. Bathroom flooded and they didn’t have a floor waste so only way to get rid of water was to mop up with towels. Called reception before 7pm to ask for a couple of towels but was told there was nothing they could do as they weren’t on site any longer. I should have let it flood. There was no tv reception in our room. Netflix was the only thing I could get working. There’s no lamps so the kids complained about the lights until we went to bed and turned the main ones off. No power next to bed either. Couldn’t charge phones. Assume because it used to be a garage and didn’t expect a bed there. Pool was dirty. No net to clean it. Pump wasn’t even turned on. No lighting in pool or bbq area at all.\nBar fridge has no door wires to hold in milk etc so, despite being a good size, all our bottles were lying down so no room for other stuff. Little wardrobe provided was water damaged because they don’t provide any hooks or hanging room so everyone puts their wet towels on doors. The only lock on our door was the sliding fly screen door. It’s actually very hard to see and get in when they don’t put the light on at this section. Everyone else had a light though. Our bathroom has a huge window which opens right in to the owners back yard. Thank god they don’t reside here. Or do they? The front door and full front of the room is glass sliding door and gets sun all afternoon. They put up some $10 drapes which do well at absorbing the heat and turning the garage in to a sauna. Can’t open them up because everyone driving past it or in the pool or walking outside has complete view in to your room through the 2m+ sliding glass doors. After reading the reviews that it’s pet friendly, I’m just praying we don’t wake up with flea bites…\nDon’t stay here. Spend a few extra bucks and get something decent if you can.\nI’d consider staying at $100 a night but 250 is extortion.\nThe restaurant down the road ‘the loose goose’ was amazing! Get down there if you can. Amazing food and service. I’d stay in this shight room again if I knew it meant I could eat there again.",

Rob was great took the stress out of parking the van, spot on with his directions. He got us between the pad and a tree first time. He gets 5 stars for service. It probably would have taken us a few goes to get it right. Site 47 is opposite the ablutions and laundry with a dump point there as well. The first evening a couple of backpackers were emptying their toilet canister and either that or the dump point when open was rank. I was going for a shower and the ladies ablutions smelt of the dump point, disgusting!\nMight be an idea to have that dump point a bit further away from vans and amenities or keep it smelling sweeter.\nThe ablutions were clean although old and well used. There is only the one lot of ablutions in the park with a couple of extra toilets by the pool.\nThe pool looked nice didn't use it a bit too cold for us. The games room was nice but the TV was out of order. I'm sure they make enough money to pop to The Good Guys and get a new one.\nThe grounds were well maintained and bins emptied regularly. It was pretty quiet except for evening roosting when the birds arrived and the noise they make is unreal. Didn't last too long though and luckily not noisy in the morning.\nOther than for the smelly dump point on that first night it's been okay.\nWe could ride our bike to the marina little cafe there did excellent coffee and scones. There a fish and chips shop we might try before we leave. You can ride into noosa for the main beach, Hastings Street and coffee and cake at the surf club. Driving is a pain and parking is near impossible.",

          "reviewText": "Ingenia Holidays Noosa North in Tewantin is a fantastic family-friendly holiday park, perfect for a Sunshine Coast getaway. Just a 15-minute drive from Noosa Main Beach and Hastings Street, it offers a range of accommodation options, from spacious villas to powered caravan sites and unique glamping Belle Tents. The park is well-maintained, with clean amenities, a heated swimming pool, kids’ wading pool, playground, and a popular camp kitchen with a pizza oven. Staff are friendly and accommodating, often going the extra mile to ensure a great stay. The location is ideal, with easy access to Noosa’s attractions, including a bus stop right outside for hassle-free trips to the beach or nearby Noosa Marina. Some guests noted that the Belle Tents could use some maintenance due to mustiness, and the pool closes early at 5:30 PM, which might disappoint some. Overall, it’s a clean, fun, and convenient base for exploring Noosa, highly recommended for families or groups looking for a relaxed yet activity-packed holiday.",

With the place described as a \"backpackers\" style accommodation, I was bracing myself for a simple, in-and-out experience. I couldn't have been more wrong. From the moment I stepped inside, the level of service completely blew me away.\nThe reception experience immediately set the tone. One of the young women greeted me with a genuine, welcoming smile. I had completely mucked up my ID, but the young lady handled the issue with incredible patience and professionalism, helping me through the process smoothly and efficiently. She got me checked in and even demonstrated their slick, modern key system—a new door key opening right on your phone via email (that’s fantastic technology!).\nGetting to the room late that evening, the positive surprises continued. I have stayed in countless 5-star hotels around the world, but the shower at Abode Mooloolaba was, without exaggeration, the best flowing shower I have ever used. It was absolutely amazing! The bed was equally comfortable, ensuring I had a deep and restful night's sleep.\nWe were up and gone early, around 7 AM, and were greeted by another friendly staff member who ended our stay just as warmly as it began, wishing us an amazing day.\nAbode Mooloolaba truly defies expectations. If you are looking for exceptional service, modern convenience, and the kind of comforts you'd expect from a luxury stay (like a phenomenal shower!), look no further. Highly, highly recommend!",

Parent supervision required on the course (be prepared to get up there). Staff there to assist but spread out so help could take awhile to come. Closed toe shoes, no phones, sunglasses but lockers there. Definitely not for those afraid of heights, as each lowest level is very high.",

The pool was clean and the area around the pool looked good aswell. There were 2 Main pools one smaller than the other, and there was swimming lessons and a play pool with water sprayers for kids, while there was a surfing machine for older kids and adults. A very nice thing to do on the weekend.",

I walked my son into the bathrooms to let him wash the chlorine off before going home and a disgusting older man extend the shower stall opposite the entrance completely naked. When I noticed and gave a disgusted look he looks at me and my son touched himself and smiled. I had to cover my son's eyes and when I walked him to his own stall the older man had the gall to laugh at me when he passed. Absolutely disgusting and despicable behaviour being allowed at the pool. I myself felt violated I can imagine how embarrassed my son was. I will never be going back to this pool and I advise others to at the very least choose not to use the bathrooms.",

I’ve noticed that some members tend to place multiple towels on different machines at once to “reserve” them. I understand everyone has limited time to train and wants to make the most of it, but this practice can make it difficult for other members, especially those who don’t feel comfortable asking to jump in or take turns.\n\nIf possible, I’d like to kindly ask if the gym could address this with members so that everyone can enjoy the space more fairly. Of course, if this towel-reserving practice is officially allowed by the gym, no worries at all — I’ll simply try to adapt as best I can.\n\nThanks so much for your attention and support!",

As it does not say it is a G’day park. We booked through the actual park site, unaware they were a g’day park,   So we payed full price, there was no provision or indication that they were a member of g’day.  Upon looking up the park later to check facilities, I noticed it actually came up on the G’day park site, where the provision to put in your membership, was available, for the members price.  I explained this to the park, but they wouldn’t refund the difference as we had already made payment.  I have attached photos to explain what I mean.  In saying this, the park is nice, amenities clean and tidy, with a nice pool.  I found reception was a bit hit and miss in terms of opening hours.  Seemed to be all over the place.  It is about 25 minutes to cairns.  And is a nice quiet park.  We would stay again, but I will make sure I book through the correct site for the member discount next time.",

The stench is very strong. This is of course not the fault of the park, and the bats are actually awesome, and all over Cairns so it's to be expected, but is just something for guests to be aware of. I couldn't quite convince myself that it was the smell of the bats, not my food, when trying to eat haha.\n\nThe pool didn't seem to be clean, and made my kids' eyes very sore, so they weren't in for long & I didn't let them go back. It was also disconcerting to receive a text message from the park at 8:30pm about a large theft problem, reminding people to lock everything away. This would have been better to be told at check in.\n\nThis is a tricky one to rate, as it wasn't a bad stay, but wasn't overly enjoyable either.",

It is quite central, a 10 min drive to most shopping and the foreshore. However the sites have been basically left unmaintained and some work is definitely needed - straggly long grass edged the slab and the rest of the site was weeds. And then there are the thefts - we had our bike locked but this was cut and stolen. And our neighbours also would have had theirs stolen too only they disturbed the thieves.  We were told after that this is a problem for this park. They do have a security man that goes thru the park but from what we witnessed this is a waste of time as a car driving around is no deterrent. The park did send a generic text message to say lock things up ( which we did) but it would have been more effective if the check in person had mentioned the issue on arrival and we would have left our bikes on our van.  Having said all this we never experienced any other issues and the park was really quiet.",

          "reviewText": "It is what it is. For context, I had just moved up to Cairns for work, and needed a place to stay for a few weeks while found something long term. I just wanted something no-frills that was reasonably easy commute.\n\nTL;DR: Cheap, mostly clean, poorly maintained. Lot of long term residents mostly OK, but you get some shouting/yelling. I didn't personally have any trouble. Area outside is really poor, pretty rough. Staff on the ground are decent, management seems apathetic.\n\nThe Good: They offer very well priced one week deals for cabins. Essentially at this price point you get a kitchenette cabin (no bathroom) to yourself for a price not much more than some backpacker dorms in town. On those terms, you can't fault it. It's a good price, and it's honest - that is what you get. The amenities blocks are clean and functional, and the showers have hot water and decent pressure. There's a laundry on-site accessible 24/7 and the washers are dryers both take card. $4 each for wash and dry. There's a shop in reception that sells the basics, including detergent sachets for the laundry. There's also a pool though I didn't try it so can't attest to the condition of it. Kitchenettes are suprisingly well appointed. You get a proper sized fridge-freezer (not those usual bar fridges with tiny freezer box) so you can get a load of meat and keep it in there. Kettle, toaster, plug in electric hob (bit shit tbqh - struggles to keep a good cast iron pot of pasta on the rolling boil), cutlery, cooking utensils, plates, bowels, mugs etc.\n\nThe Bad: The whole setup is very tired, and is showing it's age. Cabins look and feel early 80s. Mine had some dodgy floor sections. Furniture was old and tired. Clean enough but was in desperate need of a refresh. Air con did cool the cabin but was noisy. Little electric hob was very low qulaity. Rust on bed frames and even fridge door. The electrics shorted on my 2nd day. Reported to reception and caretaker twice. Caretaker got it on and we tested everything to locate the offending circuit (one of the lights), and he said he'd get some parts to fix, but despite him chasing managers a few times, it didn't get fixed during my stay (just didn't use the dodgy light). Bathroom block had a few toilets with missing locks or fittings that never seemed to get fixed. My cabin had a minor leak in severe rain.\n\nThe Ugly: Though there's an official rule of a max 28 day stay, it's clear as day a sizable number of people are de-facto tenants staying here permanently. Most are fine and decent people just trying to survive - by end of my 2nd week, we smiled and waved as we passed each other heading in and out (same with the staff), but there also a few shady figures and a few nights there was yelling and screaming. The area the park is in is at the cursed meeting point of the \"Three Ms\" suurbs, which are some of the poorest and most troubled suburbs in Cairns. The fence around the park has had barbed wire twisted around it, and that's no paranoia. There's a reason for it.  No one ever took anything from my car, not tried to get into my cabin. I only really once felt *unsafe* (two drunk people yelling in the laneway my cabin was on), but bascially, there are legitimate issues and the area outside is derro central.\n\nNote on wifi: There's no wifi in the cabins. You can get it in reception, and there's a small seating area there. Good phone reception so I just tethered. There's a TV in the cabins with the usual channels",

We were those disorganised travellers who arrive in town in peak season in the late afternoon with no accomodation booked. The staff in the park bent over backwards to move things around to fit us in.\n\nThis time around I was airlifted from cape York to cairns after experiencing a medical emergency. My mum had flown from Perth and my partner and friends needed a place to base themselves so they could be with me in hospital. Again, the staff went well out of their way to accomodate us. We have been here nearly 3 weeks this time and I couldn’t have asked for a nicer place to recover.\n\nThe staff have been so compassionate, generous and attentive.\n\nThe amenities cannot be faulted. There is a beautiful pool area with BBQs and a camp kitchen that is kept extremely clean.\n\nThe toilets and showers are beautifully clean with new upgrades to the showers.\n\nMy mum stayed in a bungalow cabin with all you need for a comfortable stay. Housekeeping was on point!\n\nThe park itself is lovely. Set below rainforest mountains across the road from a lovely running river. The caravan sites are grassy and spacious and gardens are kept beautifully. It even has a delightful little cafe that serves a mean smashed avo and great coffee!\nWith close access to shops, doctors and tourist attractions such as white water rafting, the skyrail, a scenic train through the mountains to the waterfalls and lovely walking trails it’s an ideal base to explore Cairns.\n\nI honestly could not fault this place.\n\nThank you Lake Placid Rainforest Retreat ❤️‍🩹",

But most importantly, the care and generosity of staff was unbelievable. Our little 3 year old man fell off his bike and broke his arm while we stayed. Paul and the beautiful “T” were so helpful and exceptionally caring. My husband wasn’t at the site when it happened, Paul helped with the ambulance call while I was with my son, and Tenielle helped my 6 year old daughter feel comfortable with colouring and even bringing down their daughter from upstairs to play with mine while the ambulance arrived and until my husband got there. Not only this, but they came and checked on us that afternoon and also gave both our son and daughter “brave” and “helpful” awards with a sweet Christmas lollie. They also gave us complimentary Powerade and water while we were navigating the ambulance in the aircon of their office. It was not what we were hoping for this part of the trip, but the genuine care and prompt response made us feel so well looked after at a home away from home. Thank you Paul, T, and the team at Palm Cove NRMA. Forever grateful.",

Not even any hooks, you are not allowed to hang towels or anything on the railing outside, so where are you supposed to hang them up? Big blank walls, not one picture, felt rather prison like.

The Hostel itself is mostly clean and the staff at the front desk are really helpful and friendly. Coming to the negative aspects. The hostel is a social/party hostel which in itself is not bad if that is your thing. Just be aware that it's never really quiet. The main problem I had during my stay were the people. I had a 10 bedroom dorm (which was fully booked) and I could not sleep one night because people were so loud during the night for example: playing music on the balcony at 1:00 AM, walking into the room and turning the light on and leaving it on, going into the bathroom that is connected to the room and puking, coughing or cleaning the dishes (dishes with food that of course attracted insects)in the bathroom sink without closing the door, people having sex in the hostel room during the night (there are no curtains on the bed so you are subjected to everything), having random people come into the room and stay the night, people slamming doors in the building and constantly screaming during night. The hostel kitchen was really dirty and you had to constantly wash the dishes before using them because no one cleaned their dishes properly or left them soaking wet and just put them on the shelf (they have signs there telling you do clean after yourself but everyone just ignored them). A lot of the ovens also didn't work which made baking stuff very difficult because the ones that did work were in constant use. What also happened a couple of times is that food got stolen out of the boxes that are used to store your food which is really annoying and disrespectful.\nNeedless to say I did not enjoy my stay at this hostel and would not recommend it to anyone who needs to rest sometimes because you won't get any.",

I've had swims interrupted due to the pool closing, which I wasn't told about when I started my swim. It's also a popular pool for school swimming events, which will close the pool to the public.\n\nThe pool is 50m but can be converted to a 25m pool. This can happen without warning.

The facilities are great and perfect for those with multiple kids as there is a fence around the pool, meaning the kids that aren't swimming are safe from the water when you are in the pool. The lessons are fantastic with fun songs or games throughout the lesson with a focus on water safety at all times. The instructors regularly explain why they are teaching what they are teaching and provide feedback regularly.\n\nI have always loved our lessons at Seahorse Aquatic Centre.

As a coach Matt supports, guides and motivates you to reach your goals. The level of progression and confidence I have observed in my children swimming once per week is no other than amazing. Matt’s wife Emma is always so friendly, helpful and accommodating working behind the scenes. They make a great team and we are so happy to be apart of the TSA family.",

Called reception and they told us the do not disturb was on the door - it was not - the clean my room was on. Told us they would send someone straight up. Went to the pool for 1.5 hours. No towels - went up to reception to ask for a towel, they said ask at the pool. Asked at the pool, they seemed uninterested and said it would be refilled eventually. After 1.5 hours in the pool, no towels arrived, so had to catch the lift back up to the room dripping wet. Get back to the room and of course had not been serviced. So we just got a couple of towels off someone close by. Then didn’t really want to face anyone else so just ordered room service. Tasted pretty awful and cost $250 for the family! The crème brûlée  had a really weird taste, like it was full of alcohol (not mentioned on the menu). Both my wife and I were up all night sitting on the toilet, so in guessing something was wrong with it! Did win $300 at the casino, so I guess that’s something, but I’ve never stayed at a casino with such terrible service! Usually with all the money they make the service is excellent. This is the second time we’ve stayed here in a month and last time they also didn’t service the room! Gave them a second chance, but will not be back!",

It was the only accomodation left in Townsville for the Footy Game so it was nice to be accommodated for during a period of high occupancy. Upon check in we did overhear that they are fully booked as to why we didn’t come to the desk and report the issues. However I think despite what you are paying whether it’s a cheap rate or a high, standards should have been higher. It was clear the room wasn’t or was poorly inspected prior our check in. The aircon cover cover was hanging off and we were hit with a strong smell of mildew and mold. The sheets were covered in marks whilst I understand myself working in hotel industry, rejects are common in linen orders. It really made me question the way both sheets were marked and not replaced with a clean one. When I made the bed I discovered that the fleece blankets had multiple grubby marks and stains on them. The sheets were fine for 1 night.\n\nHowever upon looking just casually around the room the walls were filthy and covered in stains. Something that would be very obvious to spot clean. The moldy aircon, marked sheets and dirty walls certainly made the cabin feel even more dirty and uncomfortable. The dated kitchen and other items are not an issue as we didn’t really care and understand. The air con made a noisy rattling sound all night, the mattresses did not have mattress protectors either. It was quite possibly the worst sleep I’ve ever had. I also suffer from an auto-immune disease and if I were staying more than 1 night I certainly would have to leave.\n\nThe public amenities were quite unkept and very dirty, whilst we also understand this is a public area and couldn’t not be cleaned every hour of every day. It felt dirty enough that I did not want to step back inside.\n\nWe thank the staff for their friendliness and being able to accomodate us and hope some changes in the cleanliness of cabin 12 can be made for future guests.\n\nCan’t say we would return but would recommend booking a higher rate room for your stay.",

It was the only accomodation left in Townsville for the Footy Game so it was nice to be accommodated for during a period of high occupancy. Upon check in we did overhear that they are fully booked as to why we didn’t come to the desk and report the issues. However I think despite what you are paying whether it’s a cheap rate or a high, standards should have been higher. It was clear the room wasn’t or was poorly inspected prior our check in.

The cabins are simple yet clean and well-equipped with the essentials, and the outdoor sites provide plenty of space for caravans and tents.\n\nOne of the standout features of the park is its peaceful atmosphere. Despite being close to the city and major roads, it has a relaxed, laid-back feel with leafy surroundings and shaded areas that give you a break from the bustle of town. The swimming pool is a great addition, especially in the warmer months, and there are BBQ facilities available for families or groups who enjoy cooking outdoors.\n\nThe location is another positive—it’s not far from the city centre, making it easy to access shops, restaurants, and Townsville’s main attractions such as The Strand, Castle Hill, and local wildlife parks. Staff are generally friendly and helpful, ensuring guests feel welcome.\n\nWhile the park is well-maintained overall, some of the facilities are a little dated and could benefit from upgrades, particularly the bathrooms and communal areas.

The site itself was great and well-suited to our needs.\n\nHowever, the toilet and shower block could benefit from some improvements. A new epoxy floor coating would greatly enhance hygiene, and several of the door locks and handles need attention. A fresh coat of paint would also help give the facilities a cleaner, more inviting appearance.\n\nWe also booked a Standard Cabin, and unfortunately this part of our stay was disappointing. The cabin was not clean and the air-conditioner was extremely loud, resulting in very little sleep for my wife and the kids. Considering the condition of the cabin, we felt the price was far too high for the standard provided.\n\nWe hope this feedback is helpful, as we would love to see these issues addressed for future guests.",

There are many permanents who are quite friendly and very chatty. The park is a great place to park up & relax.\nWould recommend",

On our first night, our site was right next to the camp kitchen, which did get a bit noisy late into the evening. We asked if we could be moved for the second night, and the staff were more than happy to accommodate us—which we really appreciated!\n\nThe grounds are very well maintained, with one of the cleanest pool areas we’ve seen on our trip. The hot tub was also a highlight! The camp kitchen stayed clean throughout our stay, and the park felt really secure with coded gate access.\n\nThe location is perfect for catching the ferry to Magnetic Island, and we even spotted turtles in the lake and wallabies in the park. Couldn’t recommend this place more!",

We enjoyed the pool in the morning before we left, but didn't have time to play mini golf, although saw others enjoying the course. The bbq and camp kitchen area was clean and tidy, with everything we needed.\n\nHalf of the shower block was closed as they were replacing hot water systems on the other half. Unfortunately, the chippy didn't check to make sure no one was using the showers before turning off the water. After walking out in a towel, covered in shampoo and soap suds, I laughed it off after scaring one of the other workers to ask how long it would be off. The shower amenities themselves are great. They ensuite style layout is really good, with plenty of space and everything you need, cleaned and well maintained.",

They are basically an expensive shack with air conditioning & rusty bunkbeds 😅 I was incredibly annoyed that when I had to extend my stay because I felt ill & couldn't travel to Cairns, Pascal was really rude & so unhelpful & charged me loads more for the next two nights because apparently the hostel was busier but it was during the week & not even the weekend! So i had no choice than to pay an extortionate price & have to swap rooms each day! The kitchen is tiny & the toilets & shower are dirty & everything is old here. Some of the staff were nice & helful & the view of the beach is nice but I much prefer Airlie beach Nomads & other Nomads I've stayed in in Australia & New Zealand. Staff are usually much nicer & extend stays for a reasonable price & facilities etc are better. The food at the hostel is very expensive & so are the drinks & they don't let anyone take their own alcohol in & they even charge guests for bingo & events there that should be free!! One of the worst backpackers i have stayed in so far & I've travelled up the entire East coast now & travelled New Zealand for 8 months before coming to Australia. It's not the staffs fault that it's run down, the company don't put enough money into this hostel",

She is friendly and has helped me out big time. It is awesome that you can have your pets here and is a god send in an accommodation world that is extremely anti-animals. The bed I had here is the comfiest I have slept in since my month long journey began and the rooms are very clean.  There is a pool for a swim and a laundry to wash your clothes. The old building at the front is beautiful and the hotel itself is situated within crawling distance to the \"strand\", a beach front precinct with parks, restaurants and of course plenty of sand. For a dog owner this is just awesome as I can just take my dogs for a walk in a nice spot at anytime.\nThe prices for the rooms are very reasonable and it seems very friendly people stay here unlike some other dodgy places I have stayed along the way! The only thing you need to be aware of is to take your key with you every time you leave the room as you cannot leave your room unlocked if you close the door...you do not want to get caught outside in your jocks and have to wake Nicole up to get you back in! All in all I enjoyed my stay here and want to stay longer. I highly recommend this place.",

The rooms aren’t anything special but they have super neat and comfortable beds  that you won’t see in many other hotels and the bedroom and bathroom are both are extremely spacious. Some might say that the style of the room could be a bit outdated but for a building like this it’s very fitting.  The rooms are also extremely clean, and have great aircon.\n\nThe one and only issue we had with the room was the pressure in the shower head was very harsh, but other than that not a single complaint.",

The rooms aren’t anything special but they have super neat and comfortable beds  that you won’t see in many other hotels and the bedroom and bathroom are both are extremely spacious. Some might say that the style of the room could be a bit outdated but for a building like this it’s very fitting.  The rooms are also extremely clean, and have great aircon.\n\nThe one and only issue we had with the room was the pressure in the shower head was very harsh, but other than that not a single complaint.",

Because of that, I had a hard time finding parking.\n\nI still had a peaceful night, but in the morning I decided to take a shower, paying $5.

The equipment is ancient, the treadmills are plonked right in the rising suns path so your morning run is literally a morning run as in you can't see anything because you're being blinded for 20 minutes, it's crowded and small, the showers don't have enough room for a duffle bag, and the changing area seats a total of two people when you add their belongings to the mix. There's only 2 hours parking which means your workout has to be 1.75 hours long, otherwise you have to pay another $5 on top of your already 26/week.\n\nNot the EMF standard, not at all. The best part of the whole experience is the end team member, who tried to make this sardine can of a gym look as good as she could, and she did a great job with her customer service. But after seeing all the other gyms, it simply doesn't match the norm.",

Only two elevators were working, and we waited up to 20 minutes on multiple occasions.\n\nBasic amenities were lacking. Cutlery and glasses provided in the room were dirty. There were no toothbrushes/toothpaste available, and not even a glass in the bathroom to place toothbrushes or toothpaste.\n\nOverall, the staff were not helpful, and there was no sense of service or hospitality you would expect from a 4- or 5-star hotel. I would not recommend staying here, as there are far better options available for the price. Very disappointing experience.",

For example, the mirrors have had the same marks for months, the toilets often have a strong smell of urine, and the showers get water buildup while using them, which is not very pleasant considering how many people pass through every day.\n\nAnother point is the staff’s attitude.

The real-time consultation was incredibly detailed, allowing me to secure a great promotion and complete my re-registration without visiting in person.\n\nThe gym has transformed impressively! I especially love that all the carpets are gone—it feels so much better. The self-massage area after workouts is absolutely fantastic! Plus, the gym has all the equipment needed for weight training!\n\nOne minor downside is that the gym feels quite warm inside. Also, since all the restrooms are unisex, the toilets were very dirty. It would be great if there were a handheld spray next to the toilet or disinfectant wipes available. Having separate spaces for men and women would be the best improvement.\n\nI’ll definitely recommend this gym to many of my friends!",

But the air conditioner whines and screams keeping me awake.\n\nNow I live in Perth but have come to the Gold Coast many times as I think the people here are the nicest in Australia.  So this is a first for me\n\nI would have said something.  But the young lady at reception.  And if management wants to follow this up I stayed on the 2/3 of Jan 2026.  In fact I’m still here for another night.  But I’ll bet they won’t follow this up.\n\nNow, I chose not to say anything as this young lady on 2 encounters once at check in and once in the morning when I went and purchased some stuff the rooms didn’t have really did not want to be there.  I get like I was asking for a favour to get her attention.  She was. Miserable.\n\nAnd what got me is that the room above me on the morning of the 3rd had something going on that involved some sort of domestic fight. There was screaming and loud and clear conversation can be heard.  And a few loud bangs with vibrations that woke me up several times.\n\nWhen I brought this to the attention of this young lady.  And said I hope the people are ok, she said without looking at me that it was probably construction.\n\nWith that I just thanked her and left. I didn’t think she would be interested if I talked about the air conditioner.  It will keep me up tonight.\n\nAnother minor detail is that when we asked for new towels. We were told that this is a no service note unless we stay 8 nights or more.\n\nThat left me puzzled, but I didn’t want to. Other then any further as they obviously had more important things to do\n\nSo yeah….   Stay somewhere else.\n\nIt’s a shame.  As it is a truly lovely place in a lovely location.\n\nToo bad about the service.",

We had no issues with staff and found them very helpful when needed.\n\nHowever the room its self was very disappointing. It was dirty with black mould above the shower and shower door handle fell off and the sink faucet was hanging on for dear life.\n\nThe deck was disgusting to the point that we didn’t want to sit and relax on it. The carpet in the room also felt very damp to the point we just wore our shoes the whole time.\n\nWould recommend for the location however not if you are wanting a clean relaxing place to stay. With some extra work and effort this could be an amazing place to stay.",

The only downside is the room itself. We were given a room on the 4 th floor but was untidy, the carpets a bit questionable, unknown stains, maintenance may be skipped on the air con. We spoke with the reception who were extremely accommodating and moved us to another room which was reasonable compared to the first one. The general feeling is, you get what you paid for, however, claiming a 3 star facility would expect slightly better hygiene standards. There is no housekeeping for a week, which means no new towels and toiletries refilled. You can get replacement towels for a small fee and purchase detergent to do laundry if required. Overall a great stay but if you are travelling with young children and susceptible to respiratory problems and allergies, recommend to contact the hotel directly and be vocal on the expectations prior to reservation rather than going through third party booking websites!",

The room was surprisingly large with decent facilities, and there was plenty of space to spread out.\n\nHowever, the kitchen and bathroom were extremely outdated, and it really showed. Even the hair dryer looked like it hadn’t been manufactured since the early 1990s, which kind of summed up the overall condition. The hallway outside my room also had a strong vomit smell during my stay, which wasn’t great to walk through.\n\nOverall, the location and views are fantastic, but the hotel desperately needs some modernising (and better cleaning) to live up to its potential.",

I was sceptical looking through photos of the property but they were all spot on! We received great communication and instructions for the check in process, we retrieved our keys from the office lockbox that is located a short walk away from the property. As soon as we opened the door I knew we’d made the right decision, the ocean views just slap you in the face! We sat on the balcony of an evening after long, fun filled days and got to wake up and see the ocean from our bed. The facilities are wonderful and shared with the Hilton Hotel, we used the amazing pools to start the day after our morning beach walks, the apartment was very spacious and had everything we required, there was some complimentary tea/coffee, sugar, milk, dish washing tablet/liquid, clothes washing powder and toilet paper, soap, shampoo/ conditioner to get us started. Having worked in motel housekeeping previously for a number of years my expectations are high and the Orchid definitely exceeded this.the apartment was spotless, located right in the centre of Surfers Paradise you can enjoy the atmosphere and close to everything you could ever need,  I would not hesitate in recommending this property and we can’t wait to get the chance to visit again. Even though we were staying as a couple the apartment and facilities are very family friendly and the staff were all very helpful. The public transport system is great, 50c fairs on the tram and bus network, we used these to get around and to the theme parks.",

          "reviewText": "​Our stay at this hotel had a very mixed feel, starting with a clean and modern room upon arrival. While we had a few initial issues like a dirty blanket and a missing cooking bowl, the staff did address these the following day. The bed was comfy, and we found the on-site microwave in the kitchen very useful for preparing simple meals, though it was frustrating that a knife for chopping was not provided. The hotel's amenities, including the lovely pool, spa, and sauna, were fantastic, and the Malaysian restaurant was a definite highlight, though it's worth noting it's only open Friday through Sunday.\n​However, the biggest letdown and the primary reason we would not stay here again was the hotel's approach to service. For a seven-night stay, we were only provided with a two-day supply of shampoo, conditioner, and washing-up liquid. We were also surprised to find there was no housekeeping service at all during our week-long visit, and no cleaning equipment was available in the room.\n​As a result, the floor became dirty and sandy, which was very unpleasant. Adding to our frustration, we discovered that fresh towels were a paid option, and a washing machine was not provided in the room. It seemed as though the hotel forces guests to either pay for extra housekeeping or accept staying in an unclean environment.\n​Additionally, our room experienced a lot of road noise, making it unpleasant to sit on the balcony. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper.\n​While the amenities were impressive, the lack of basic cleanliness services and the policy of charging for essentials left a very poor impression. We wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone planning a longer stay unless they are prepared to handle all cleaning themselves or pay extra for the basics. We felt we had paid a lot of money to stay here and should not have to pay even more for cleanliness. It's a real shame as it could of been great.",

Dish  washer didn’t work, shower drain was blocked luckily we got it fixed the next day. Parking is a bit tricking and awkward spots especially if you have a large car. There was even a dead flat frog on the floor. The elevator was broken on the north tower. The first floor smelt like vomit (and there was a vomit stain) The garbage disposal room had a broken door. The sliding door in our room always came off the hinges. One of the only things that lighten the mood was the free tester cookies.\n\nlook I know that is a lot of problems but sovreign isn’t completely bad, it’s good value I guess.",

This is unacceptable given the price, even during the Christmas period. They should schedule more frequent cleaning rounds considering how full the campground is. The reception staff don’t even seem to be aware of the cleaning situation in their own campground. As for the washing machines, apparently three are enough for the entire campground!\n\nHonestly, don’t trust the Discovery brand image, because this place does not meet the quality standards of the other campgrounds in this chain at all. Stay away!!",

Based on the state of the room, I wouldn’t trust the pool to be clean either.

I had to cancel two classes because my son had chickenpox, and I simply wanted to reschedule the lessons. However, instead of allowing me to reschedule one of the existing classes, they insisted that I change my plan to once a week, which would increase the cost of each class.\n\nI reluctantly agreed to this change, even though I knew I would be losing money, but then they still refused to let me alter my schedule to once a week without paying for two additional lessons over the next two weeks. They claimed I needed to give a two-week notice for any cancellation. The issue was, I just wanted to temporarily switch to once a week for two weeks to use the two missed lessons, and then return to my regular two lessons per week.\n\nThe whole system is extremely complicated and frustrating, and this was the second time I was treated poorly by their staff.

          "reviewText": "I had a terrible experience with the swimming school in the Miami location due to poor customer service. I had to cancel two classes because my son had chickenpox, and I simply wanted to reschedule the lessons. However, instead of allowing me to reschedule one of the existing classes, they insisted that I change my plan to once a week, which would increase the cost of each class.\n\nI reluctantly agreed to this change, even though I knew I would be losing money, but then they still refused to let me alter my schedule to once a week without paying for two additional lessons over the next two weeks. They claimed I needed to give a two-week notice for any cancellation. The issue was, I just wanted to temporarily switch to once a week for two weeks to use the two missed lessons, and then return to my regular two lessons per week.\n\nThe whole system is extremely complicated and frustrating, and this was the second time I was treated poorly by their staff. Now, I feel forced to continue going to the school for the next two weeks, even though I’ve already paid the full price. I’m also being pressured to take three classes in one of the weeks, which is not ideal.

          "reviewText": "Absolutely appalling treatment of a nervous toddler\n\nAfter spending thousands of dollars at this swim school, I am beyond disgusted by their shocking lack of empathy and unprofessionalism today. My 3-year-old daughter has anxiety around swimming, and any change in routine or teacher is extremely upsetting for her. Despite this, we were making progress - until today.\n\nWithout any prior warning, we arrived for her lesson only to be told she'd been kicked out of her class and she is being ‘moved up’ to make room for other children who \"needed more assistance.\" This was blatantly untrue, as those children were more competent swimmers and weren't crying at all. My daughter was left sobbing hysterically on the side of the pool while the teachers made eyes at each other and everyone was staring. I was also there by myself with my toddler and my other baby in the pram.\n\nI begged them to please let her join her familiar class for today only so we can avoid months of regression, but I was completely ignored for 15 minutes while my daughter screamed/cried. To spring this on a sensitive toddler with zero notice is simply unacceptable.\n\nIf you have a child who needs a little extra understanding and support, avoid this swim school at all costs. It doesn't take much effort to call or email me before to let me know we have changed classes. Their disregard for my daughter's wellbeing was appalling, and I will be taking my business elsewhere.",

Starting with the booking process, LeAnn was extremely helpful working through some tech challenges placing the reservation from the US. Our stay over Christmas holiday was great - the kangaroos are everywhere, staying in the shade of our tent during the day. We reserved the premium paperbark glamping tents with the ensuite bathroom and shower- they were in great shape and clean. This time of year there are often massive thunderstorms in the evening, and the glamping tents were very sturdy and dry. Restaurant/bar were a nice bonus with more food and drink options than I expected at a campground. Access between the campground and nearby towns/highway was easy.",

The bar area is very nice but this is evidently where they have spent their money—the toilets and showers are lacklustre. We camped in the gums and we were too far from the showers.\n\nLittle to no internet connection across the site; but free WiFi available at the bar.\n\nAlso, they have an unnecessarily restrictive check-in process. They’ll flat-out turn you down and leave you stranded if you check in after 21:00. Not ideal if you’re travelling long distances to stay here.\n\nThe camp kitchen did not have any hobs for normal cooking. Many other sites have far better cooking facilities.\n\nCool that there were tonnes of kangaroos and lizards around. The lakeside is also very nice, although the powered sites back directly onto the sandy beach area. It feels like you’re invading other guest’s space if you sit on the beach in the evening.",

The best part for us was the beautiful, shallow and warm water. It meant we could relax while the kids splashed and played safely for hours.\nThe facilities were top-notch, especially the proper bar with food. It was so convenient to grab a meal or a drink without having to leave the site. We didn't have to worry about cooking every night, which made the trip feel like a true vacation.\nOverall, if you're looking for a stress-free camping experience with great amenities and a safe, kid-friendly swimming area, Habitat Noosa is an excellent choice. We can't wait to go back!",

We enjoyed the Tavern and appreciated the service from staff.  Just a couple of suggestions.  With so many campers, more showers attached to the toilets closer to camp sites would be a bonus.  We were a bit disappointed with the state of the toilets.  There was often no soap which to me indicates that more soap dispensers are required.",

I do not recommend the waterfront camping, although the spot is beautiful, and unfortunately the wind was insane that we left early after one night, we couldn’t even cook on the stove. But we had booked five spots, with three families right on the waterfront, unfortunately other guests ruined the experience for us. People walking through our camp to get to the beach, using the shower late at night next to our tent, which therefore affected my sleep and my babies sleep. There is a picnic table near the end spot and we had people sit there until 10.15pm talking and laughing so loud. If you want quiet, waterfront isn’t for you. You also have huge groups walking past throughout the day to use the jetty, and they are loud and nosey. It wasn’t peaceful at all. Not one bit. Unfortunately because I have camped up the road at boreen point and it was quiet, I assumed this waterfront would be the same.\nYou can camp elsewhere at habibat noosa and have quiet spots but waterfront is not a quiet spot.\nHad we known this, we wouldn’t of booked it. People actually sat on our camp site to watch the sunrise - so other guests ruined our experience which is no fault of habitat noosa. The area is amazing, and the service in the bar is great. The options for things to do are good too and the bathrooms are clean and tidy. So at no fault of habitat Noosa, other than it not being made obvious when booking, waterfront camping is not a peaceful experience and as we had to leave early and lost out on money, we wouldn’t choose to stay here a third time.",

The Bed was very comfortable.\n\nCons: lack of tea towels, 1 towel for the duration of the stay, fees for extra towels.\nEnough toiletries for 1 person only.\nPeople smoking on balconies- haven’t witnessed this in a long time. Balconies are very close together. The smoke goes into your apartment. It should be banned with a smoking area provided.\nUnit walls are paper thin, in our experience it was a very noisy stay with lots of kids yelling and disrupting the peace between 9pm-11pm. Not the hotels fault but I think it’s worth noting for future visitors. Every footstep can be heard from upper levels.\nNo access to staff on site from 4pm-ish onwards.\n\nWithout the noise and smoke it would be a 5 star review. I’d visit just for the Thai food it was that good.",

We were able to check in super early, rooms had AC and bathroom shared between 9 but you could use any on site. The private kitchen with an oven was a highlight and a nice change from dirty, communal kitchens you find in other hostels.\n\nMy only negative comments are lack of storage/lockers in the room and the door itself not even locking so leaving valuables felt a bit risky. Also the wifi only worked in the communal areas so didn’t quite stretch to our room and the checkout was on the early side (9:30) but you can still use the common area and store bags during the day.

Their bathroom is a single one with a shower in it for two rooms, so more private than lockers which is great. They are very reasonable with their guests too. Enjoyed my stay there.",

The lovely Tamara met us at the property after we arrived at 8:30am from our early flight. we were not expecting to be able to have access to anything (we had planned on just waiting around at the beach until our room was ready) but we were given an early check-in which was unexpected and SO helpful with 2 young kids in tow. We were given a complimentary bottle of wine (we chose a Prosecco) to enjoy during our stay (which we did!) and Tamara even return the following day with a gorgeous complimentary chocolate Easter hamper from Maleny Chocolate Co for us and the kids to enjoy. The room was always impeccably serviced (daily) which was SO helpful as we often brought in wet towels from the pool and sand from the beach. Our toddler had accidentally wet the bed during his lunchtime nap the second day after we arrived and they changed the bed sheets without any issues. The lovely Kathryn also allowed us to have a late check out - also unheard of! The location and stay was just magic - we cannot wait to be back, we've found our place for our Noosa getaways and wont stay anywhere else. Thanks to the team at 71 Hastings for making our stay spectacular. Your attention to detail and effort in going above and beyond really made it feel not only stress free, but we felt spoilt - we really appreciated it.",

Unfortunately today’s visit was really disappointing, the spa pool surrounds were dirty and several of the spa jets were not working.  We had a blitz shower and many of the jets were not working, the sauna was dirty and overall the place looked tired and a but grubby.    Our massages were fabulous, however one of the massage rooms had tiles missing and it was dirty.   We ordered the champagne and cheese which was given to another guest, i only found that out when i asked about it at reception.  We did get a refund.   Overall it was disappointing and a big step down from my previous visits.  I thought you should know and hopefully these areas can be improved\nKaren Gahan",

Pretty clean today, but as usual, there is literally 2 lanes given to kids' swimming area. The ENTIRE 50m pool is roped off for 2 people lane swimming. Almost the entire inside pool is roped off for.....zero lane swimmers! Its like this every time I visit. And the life guards yell at kids who dare to cross into a lane to retrieve a toy. Totally happy to share the pool with lane swimmers, but do 2 swimmers need it ALL? and in the school holidays? Its farcical. My cynical side says they do it so they have less area to patrol and therefore, fewer life guards on duty.",

The spa, is slightly better,  but the floor in the whole pool is filthy. Members are being ripped off to swim,  spa and sauna in a disgustingly filthy environment.

Gifted a back-pack & 2 drink bottles. I love the \"all in this together atmosphere\", good music, music videos available to view on all of the walking & bike machines. Very clean & tidy, all the equipment works perfectly, is brand new, Matrix written everywhere. A greenery garden in the middle of the bike area is lovely, half expecting a frog to jump out. There is a huge group fitness room, all new, great lighting, plus a pilates/ barre room, a circuit only room, plus a workout area with a view. Showers & lockers & WiFi available. 24hr access, I have already been in on the weekend. Group exercise classes are available plus you can study fitness through the club. Aren't we lucky.",

Some of these are easily rectified, some not so much.\n\n- There are 5 half racks, yet no olympic lifting/deadlifting platform?? There is currently nowhere to deadlift except for the normal gym floor\n- In front of the racks toward the back of the building the floor is extremely un-level, so your barbell will just roll into the racks when you set it down\n- Despite being massively over-provisioned on bumper plates (seriously, they spent tens of thousands on bumper plates that will never get used. 40 5kg plates, 48 10kg plates, 48 20kg plates) there is not one single 1.25kg plate, so make sure you BYO or your progression sensitive lifts will suffer\n- No EZ Curl bar for the preacher station - I assume this will be rectified soon and they are just waiting\n- No specialty bars whatsoever. I assumed there would be a safety squat bar, but alas I have to do my current lower body routine at home. Trap bar and Swiss bar wouldn't go astray either.\n- None of the short back upright benches which are great for tricep extensions\n\nAll in all, good work on the launch team, I do really enjoy my upper body days there. I also like that there's only one giant screen, and I'm not being constantly bombarded with news about machete attacks etc",

Theres an expansive playground that my neices and nephews and thousands of other kids take full advantage of and then theres the walkways and bike lanes around the lake itself thats home to a myriad of ducks.

I gave only 1 star because of generally quiet location, proximity to shops and Toowoomba city, and pleasant interactions with office and cleaning staff.\n1. Communication. Days prior to arrival leaving phone and website messages to extend booking went unanswered, until we phoned the AH Emergency number to night manager so our request would be actioned. A return call the next day finally gave an apology with an explanation that the park was recently sold as the excuse for poor staff handling. We hoped that this would be the only negative for our stay , but this was not to be .\n2. Sale of property. If true, then the previous owner has withheld not completing badly needed maintenance. These are:\na. Women’s showers - badly dripping outdated old-style shower roses wasting valuable water, a light sensor which does not turn on in quite dim conditions limiting shower use ,( when the men’s light always turns on when entering!), I noticed a shower wall with a sticker from a swimsuit/underwear liner that a lazy foul patron has just stuck it on a wall, but the cleaning staff have not removed and has been there the whole 5 day stayover. The bathroom smells like it needs a good dose of bleach down the drains. Which maintenance installer would think to put soap dispensers and hand dryers at 1.6 m high? No common sense. Where children cannot reach and water drips down your arm while using dryer. More modern eco shower roses would save water wastage.\nSurely even if patrons have not complained or reported the dripping  roses and light faults the cleaning staff should have. So a response  on day 3 saying that repairs would have to wait for the maintenance staff is an excuse to send me on my way, when this already should’ve been identified, reported and a maintenance person allocated to the job.\nb. Small sites. We have a 8m motor home and a car. While the site was fine for our motorhome- just!; the car had to be parked across front of concrete area , as the parking as per the site map should’ve been between our concrete path and the next van, but this was too close to open car doors without impacting our side curtain.\nc. The internet only works in the camp kitchen area. Hot spotting doesn’t work either. Very poor connectivity and likely the cheapest plan. So the advertised Free Wifi is useless and misleading.\nd. The roads in the far east of the park have potholes so big and wide and deep - in deplorable condition requiring urgent repairing.\ne. No yellow bin for recycling. Very poor and disappointing not to have this available.\nIn general this park is in poor run down old condition requiring significant repairs and maintenance,  and funds to improve it. We didn’t even bother to try pool, BBQ or camp kitchen. Whilst this is in a quiet location, I would not come again nor advise anyone else to either. Bathroom cleanliness and maintenance is our most important item in a caravan park. Sadly, this park is way off the mark which does nothing to attract repeat customers.",

The site was opposite a nice grassy reserve. The site had a concrete slab for our van and the  awning, though they were sloped. The amenities were clean and in working order, though they need a renovation. The park was very quiet. There is only one boom gate for entry and exit and the keypad for the gate was a little difficult to reach from our tow vehicle. On the whole, I would recommend this caravan park.",

Every facility was clean and functional, with the kitchens working perfectly, complete with gas and hot water. We can't recommend this place enough!",

Had no issues with thieving as others mention. Amenities spotless too and the radio a great touch. Will be back again a bit later in year",

It was the perfect place to stay; we absolutely loved it. The park itself looks beautiful and the amenities are modern and clean. The staff, like Jenny, Sharon and Paul, are absolutely lovely, so warm, friendly and helpful. This is not always the case and certainly helps set this caravan park apart from others. We found our stay quiet and relaxing with everything we could want. It is perfect for those travelling with dogs. We cannot wait to return for another stay very soon. Highly recommended! Mel and Fred :)",

Love the larger size of the toddler area, a lot of centers only have a tiny safe space for littles but there was plenty to do even for the smaller bubs which is fantastic!\nMaybe a few more staff on to help with the flow of getting in the doors and ordering etc but other than that I can’t fault it!\nHighly recommend!!",

Clean facilities, food service that is quick, friendly staff and coffee I have literally raved about.\n\nWe’ve been 3 times and my two year old enjoyed himself so much he now says Tabatinga and asks to go there most mornings. He also asks for the cake from there with great regularity. I have since promised him another visit on Monday and am looking forward to it!",

The salt cave environment is beautiful & calming & I think the sit in a chair & relax would be the nicer way to experience it. Please know there is no toilet in the building, but there is one in the shopping complex. Consultation before the massage was brief but still nice they asked us about our ailments prior to massage. The massage beds arnt very comfortable, they do provide nice big towels which was great. It was difficult to be comfortable as the massage progressed so it wasn't as enjoyable as we hoped. The staff are very nice though & thoughtful in their approach as the massages progressed. Still, it was a nice experience just not what we had envisaged.",
