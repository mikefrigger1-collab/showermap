You find wristbands everywhere, the toilets are dirty all the time, and many of the male-shower sensors don’t work. I raised this with reception, and they showed the worst attitude, acting like I was lying. They don’t even bother to say “hi” sometimes, someone should teach them how to smile!\nSome of the showers don’t even have a shower head, and the water is either freezing cold or extremely hot. The change rooms and showers need hourly cleaning, and the Jacuzzi/steamroom temperature should be much higher than it is now. As always, they seem to care only about money, and it takes ages for them to fix even simple issues like the shower sensors.\n\nI’m writing this in advance: instead of replying with a generic “sorry about your experience bla bla,” take responsibility, fix the issues mentioned, and show some respect to your customers, and smile! If you don’t like this job, don’t do it, but if you are doing it, do it properly, and smile!",

A great swim with a slide for the kids, whirlpool, spa, sauna, and lap pools for me, we loved it all. The condition of all equipment, including showers were great considering other simular centres. My only concern with this pool is the humidity inside, its good to be warm but can feel dehydrating, bring water to hydrate. As a family we love swimming and i would recommend to any family. Follow-up to this review still a great place to swim, got a bit busy today and felt like you had no space for yourself. Further follow-up, pool much the same bit of a bother that no lap pools are heated.",

For kids swimming classes. And less than 20 kids showed up, one of which puked in the pool.\n\nIt’s not safe for a mobility disabled person to swim here. They don’t always have a safe lane to be in, and will force you with swimmers, kids or into the stairwell all of which feels demeaning and dehumanising. Can’t a disabled person be allowed Acess to an appropriate lane as much as the kids and swimmers has access and support.",

If I could change a few things it would be to have less kids in the class as currently they have 6 kids. With 30mins for the class it’s not enough time for all kids to really engage. The change rooms are tricky also because I have a girl and boy and my boy needs me to help him change as he is 8 I can’t go in the family room and he can’t change in the men’s room alone. Lastly my son does his class in the middle lane and for him to get out it’s hard as he is a big boy and I can’t pull him out because of my back injury. Other then those three points I’m really happy with lessons.",

The other star loss was the showers, yes there was food on the floor here too but the showers had a timer on them which is fine but the timer to not allow it to be turned back on for about a minute, which if you have shampoo in kids hair is not helpful! There could probably be some more seating however it was a hot day and there may have been more people than usual. The staff were friendly and easy to talk to making a quick entry.",

My child does swimming lessons here and we have been very happy with the approach and the teachers. Aqua classes are great too. There is one small family change room up the back near the toddler pool. There us also a steam room but it hasn't been operational lately. Free parking.",

But the facilities are often disturbingly dirty - the tiled concourse looks dirty, the tiles in the pool at each end are coated in peoples body grease (how hard is it to give it a scrub ALC?) and I’m sure the showers aren’t cleaned from one day to the next. I’ve often found the same clumps of long hair stuck to the walls and drain in the showers are still there the next day.  Same with small pieces of paper, yellow wrist bands etc The floors in the change room area look muddy, especially around the drains. Seriously, a floor scrubber or a steam clean would easily take care of this. I swim at other pools in the region, and this one feels especially unloved and grimy. Other pools seem to have staff constantly cleaning things whether it’s with a squeegee to dry the floors or a floor scrubbing machine, or just cleaning the windows. And if you look up as you swim, literally sheets of paint hang down from the steel beams - as though the peeling paint will fall into the pool. Guess that’s just poor workmanship though. The upsides are the warm water, the staff testing water quality frequently, the friendly people who swim there…there’s lots to commend, but overall the hygiene of the place feels super suspect, and it wouldn’t be that difficult to remedy.",

When I first started at the gym, I was diagnosed with severe arthritis in my knees and had chronic pain. I was even advised to stop lifting weights and just focus on swimming or biking. However, the trainers at Aequus completely turned things around for me. They took the time to assess my movement patterns and helped me correct them, ensuring I was performing exercises with the right technique. As a result, I'm now able to lift weights safely, target the correct muscle groups, and, most importantly, I no longer experience knee pain. The community at Aequus is also incredibly supportive and welcoming, making every session enjoyable. I highly recommend Aequus Movement to anyone looking for expert training and a supportive fitness community!",

The open space makes it easy to move around, so you never feel like you're on top of other people. Plus, it's in a mall, so you're just steps away from some great food and coffee spots for a post-workout treat. All in all, it's a fantastic place to break a sweat!",

For example, the water dispenser in the middle area has been broken for ages, and they still haven’t bothered to fix it.

The change rooms are filthy, the toilets are filthy, and wristbands are left scattered everywhere. Unlike other swimming pools in Canberra, there is no regular cleaning. For a swimming pool, someone should be cleaning the change rooms every hour — not just once a day!\n\nConclusion:\nZERO customer care. Money is all they care about.

As a base for a short trip, it offered great value for money and a quiet, comfortable experience.\n\nThe room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable, ensuring a great night's sleep both nights. We were particularly impressed with the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk, who made check-in and check-out smooth and efficient.\n\nThe location is convenient, particularly with the free on-site parking, and it's just a short drive to the Parliamentary Triangle and the shops and restaurants in Manuka and Kingston.\n\nWhile the bathroom felt a little dated, everything worked perfectly, and the shower pressure was excellent. Overall, this hotel is a solid choice for those visiting Canberra who prioritize comfort, cleanliness, and great value outside of the busy CBD.",

On a side note the air con was very noisy.\n\nThe camp site itself was pleasant and kept, and the Pool was also a fantastic facility. I do wish though that the laundry was open a bit later. I wasn't able to clean my clothes after a very busy day, and an early departure for the next day. That all being said, I'd recommend staying here, but would especially recommend it, if those concerns could be remedied.",

However even arriving there just before the advertised check in time of 2pm to try to check in quickly, we were told our cabin wasn't ready even by then!  SO we then had to sit around waiting until finally at 2:30pm they could check us into the room.  Their excuse was it is a big park and takes a long time to clean it all.  So if you know that why not hire enough cleaners to be able to do it all in the 4 hours between 10am check outs and specified 2pm check ins, so guests can check in at the advertised time?  It was especially disappointing as we had specifically called ahead to ask!\n\nWhen we got to the cabin there was a large bag of dirty laundry and a small bag of rubbish from the bin still sitting on the door step which we had to move away just to get in the door.  The bags sat there for several hours and were finally picked up quite a bit later in the day.\nThen trying to make some tea or coffee, there were only a very few of the tiny spoon full packets of long life milk. Not even the normal small Long life milk cartons that most parks have.   Walking back to the office to ask for more milk, please, we were told no they didn't have any.\n\nIn the cabin itself we turned on the Air Con (which was very hard to get to turn on and off)  and then set it for the temperature we wanted, but it never adjusted in any way.  It just blew out some air, but never cold enough to actually cool the room on a warm day, no matter the setting.  It was either dodgy, or pre-set to not be able to run strong enough to cool the cabin much.\n\nOther things around the cabin of poor quality, or just missing were for example, the curtains had holes in them and didn't close very well.  The dining table was lopsided and didn't sit flat.  The toilet paper was very thin and there was no box of tissues.  Regarding the bottles for use in the shower, the little bottle of shampoo had actually been mostly used up, probably by a previous guest, but it was still left there with the other two bottles and hadn't been replaced with a new full one!   There was also no information folder of what was available there and what might be around the area?\nThey were pushing us to sign up for the buffet breakfast and to eat there, but you had to register the night before to get the 'discount' price of $21 (still fairly high for brekkie) or if you didn't pay ahead the price was very much more the next morning.  We didn't bother and when we go back to Canberra, it will be to stay somewhere else!",

It just blew out some air, but never cold enough to actually cool the room on a warm day, no matter the setting.  It was either dodgy, or pre-set to not be able to run strong enough to cool the cabin much.\n\nOther things around the cabin of poor quality, or just missing were for example, the curtains had holes in them and didn't close very well.  The dining table was lopsided and didn't sit flat.  The toilet paper was very thin and there was no box of tissues.  Regarding the bottles for use in the shower, the little bottle of shampoo had actually been mostly used up, probably by a previous guest, but it was still left there with the other two bottles and hadn't been replaced with a new full one!   There was also no information folder of what was available there and what might be around the area?\nThey were pushing us to sign up for the buffet breakfast and to eat there, but you had to register the night before to get the 'discount' price of $21 (still fairly high for brekkie) or if you didn't pay ahead the price was very much more the next morning.  We didn't bother and when we go back to Canberra, it will be to stay somewhere else!",

If you are in a caravan I understand it doesn't matter, but in a tent this is socially unacceptable and feels very unsafe.\n\nThankfully, I was able to change my campspot to a 'park' campspot after the first night.\n\nThere was also scabies cream packagaing in the showers and disposed bedding in a shopping trolley next to the bins for the duration of my stay.

If you are in a caravan I understand it doesn't matter, but in a tent this is socially unacceptable and feels very unsafe.\n\nThankfully, I was able to change my campspot to a 'park' campspot after the first night.\n\nThere was also scabies cream packagaing in the showers and disposed bedding in a shopping trolley next to the bins for the duration of my stay. A bit of a nightmare, but that's just my experience. Beware tent goers!",

Facilities are in good nick and there's a coffee machine for staff! The only downside was that in a dorm of 10 students, there was just the one shower and one toilet.

Leo at reception was a massive help in assisting us with extending our stay, thanks Leo!! The staff are all so helpful and friendly, shoutout to Lune and Henry as well.\n\nRooms:\nFirst we stayed in a 6-bed dorm which was good, your typical dorm room. Bottom bunks have curtains, top bunks have access to the tops of the lockers to set your things, and there is a fan and mini fridge. We extended our stay and moved to a private + ensuite. The room was great, with a fan, mini fridge, and TV. We extended again and moved to a private with no ensuite, which still had the fan, fridge, and TV.\n\nBathrooms:\nShowers and bathrooms are often busy but there are lots around the hostel, so something will usually be available. With high traffic they can sometimes get dirty, as with most hostels. The staff are visibly working hard to clean every day, and they stay on top of it. Towels are provided!\n\nKitchen:\nBreakfast is provided every day from 8am to 10am (toast, peanut butter, jam, marmalade, butter, vegemite, and some cereal options with milk), and dinner is provided on Tues/Thurs/Sat at 8pm. Dinner rotates between pasta, rice/veggies, and BBQ. Thank you to Dave for cooking!\n\nThe kitchen is closed every day at 10am for about an hour so staff can clean, so be aware when you’re planning breakfast.\n\nStaff are very good and making sure people leave the courtyard by 10pm so it’s quiet near the rooms. People usually move to the TV room or front porch to hang out past 10.\n\nThey offer daily activities on their WhatsApp channel, such as city walks, picnics, pub trivia, and basketball at a local outdoor court.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again!",

Today’s experience was particularly frustrating, as I was unable to find a spot despite arriving early, and this almost led to missing our class.\n\nWhat’s even more disappointing is that while the centre has a strict policy against last-minute cancellations or deferrals, there is no flexibility when circumstances like this—beyond our control—prevent attendance. I would be more than happy to defer the class to the following week if parking is not available, rather than being penalised for something that’s clearly a logistical issue.\n\nI believe a more organised approach is needed during event days to ensure that regular class attendees are not disadvantaged. Perhaps allocating a portion of the car park for lesson participants or providing prior notification and alternate solutions could be considered.\n\nI’m also curious to know if other parents have raised similar concerns and how they’ve managed in these situations.\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider this feedback.

Finally found out after 30 mins of wondering around where I was suppose to go. Once the lesson was over i found the only facility to shower my little one was in the \"parent room\". Which is, put simply- a toilet and a shower. There are no benches for bags, no hooks for clothes, no change table in the same room etc nothing. Just a wet floor and a toilet (which I had to constantly keep my son away from because it was disgusting).\n\nThis was my very first experience taking my son to swimming lessons. Once I left,I phoned in and cancelled immediately. Extremely disappointing.",

Asked them on 2 occasions to ensure the room was cleaned, but it never was. It appeared that the floors were never cleaned as after I asked for the room again to be cleaned, I walked in, got a face washer and cleaned up a handful of my hair. I also found a facewasher I used where the kettle was, the only thing I could suggest is that they used it to do the cleaning. It made me feel sick to my stomach.",

It was hot when we arrived but with  the air conditioning turned on it was bloody cold, no matter what temperature it was set at. The lazy room cleaners who were all standing outside talking doing nothing when we went out for the day made the bed but did not change the towels, just left them on the bathroom floor, nor did they empty the bins one of which was full. The room had also not been dusted for quite a few days.  When I complained to the front desk as we left the next morning the attitude of what I think was the manager was that he couldn’t really care less. He said that we had probably left the do not disturb light on. I pointed out if that was the case, which it wasn’t, why did they go in and make the bed? He then simply said ,\nUnconvincingly, “we will try and do better”. I felt very disappointed as we stay at a large number of hotels and rarely see such a disingenuous person at the front desk. We have also stayed at quite a few Accor hotels.  Also, when checking in we were told we needed to pay $15 a night to park in the car park as it wasn’t safe to leave a car outside. We found out whilst eating out that night that there was a free, perfectly safe, car park 50 meters away, and that street parking in that area was safe. It appears based on what we were told by others we were lied to so they could charge an extra fee. I intend complaining to head office about this. In upshot we paid for a service we didn’t get and were charged for something we didn’t need. Not a great portrayal for this hotel.\nI very much doubt they will respond to this review as having now looked at their reviews Incan see they respond to positive comments but not ones where the service has been poor. I also saw another review that also mentioned poor cleaning standards and a lack of concern by the front desk when mentioned.",

For the price, location and amenities we need and how often we have to stay in Canberra it works great for my family.\nIt's not the newest fanciest nicest place but the staff are always really helpful and friendly, we love the plants everywhere and always seem to have the pool to ourselves, my child LOVES looking at the indoor fish ponds.\nIt is annoying that you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the pool but you can also get to it through the car park but I don't want to walk my young child through the cars.\nIt's always clean (for an older hotel that is hard to keep spotless) and the location in the city is very convinient but the loud traffic at night makes it a bit difficult for light sleepers. Bed is moderately comfortable. Buffett breakfast is always great!\nHaving dinner at the restaurant is good, yummy and great service (portion sizes a bit small for the price) but room services 🤢 yuck! everytime we have ordered it is gross so we avoid that now. The free parking is really convenient.\nOverall we think value for money makes this a great affordable comfortable stay 😁",

I checked in at 6 pm on 19/11 and was planning for a simple overnight stay. Before going to bed, I went to take a shower, but as soon as I turned on the water, the hot water knob fell off, followed immediately by the cold water knob. I had to stop my shower and get out because it was impossible to continue. Accidents happen, so I didn’t make a big deal of it at the time.\n\nHowever, the next morning brought another surprise: the toilet flush didn’t work at all because no water was filling the tank. I had to go down to the lobby just to use the bathroom.\n\nAt checkout, I showed the reception staff the broken shower knobs and informed them about the toilet issue. Not even an apology just a completely indifferent response.\n\nOverall, a horrible experience. Poor maintenance, no customer service, and a stay I would not wish on anyone.",

The fact that the doors have a do not disturb sign implies that if you don't put that out your room will be serviced. (Particularly since the name of the place includes the word SERVICED.\n-the meals/lounge area is small & overcrowded with oversized furniture. Not great for a wheelchair user.\n-it is not obvious until you arrive that you have to go through one of the bedrooms to get to the bathroom. That made for a very uncomfortable situation.\n-there are no shelves in the bathroom to put your toiletries on. So you either have to put them on the floor or take them to & from your room every time you want to use them.\n-there aren't an adequate amount of towel rails particularly considering how many people the unit can accommodate.\n-there are insufficient grab rails.\n-the wash basin is too low so I consistently hit my knees when using it.\n-the shower floor is not graded properly which means water goes everywhere. Not at all safe, and we had to use endless towels to mop up the water so no one slipped.\n-the bathroom amenities are individual items. In this day & age most motels/hotels use refillable bottles which are more environmentally friendly.\n-the shower taps have been installed incorrectly.\n-the wash basin doesn't drain properly & obviously hasn't for quite sometime. This makes me think housekeeping needs to be more attentive.\n-the mattresses were very uncomfortable. There were also no spare pillows. I guess we could have asked for them, but that seems like one of those things that should just be standard.\n\nWe stay in approximately 20 places per year, this is one of the worst accessible bathrooms I have come across.

When you arrive you receive a leaflet with information that the rooms are not serviced daily and you have to ask if there is any thing you need.\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday. We booked and stayed for 10 days and the rooms were not serviced once. So not vacuumed, no bin emptied, nothing. There was no option to hang something on the door asking for the room to be serviced either.\nWe booked a classical room with a double and single bed as my partner snores quite loudly so it's easier to sleep in separate beds. The double sagged badly (see photo). We asked on Sunday if we could could change rooms because of the bed and were shown other rooms with beds that also sagged.\nThe fridge was behind the door to the apartment inside a cupboard with sliding doors, so most times you opened the door it tended to hit the mirrored doors. Luckily the mirror didn't break.\nThere were no power points near the main bed in any of the rooms we were shown, which is a problem when you rely on cpap. We opted on Sunday to stay where we were as nothing we'd been shown was better than what we had.\n\nThere was a side table with one shelf. We discovered that it didn't have all it's pegs to support it when I put something on the shelf and it promptly slid to the back and fell down to the bottom shelf.\n\nOn Monday the staff said we could change to a better room as they were not busy, and we were staying another week.\n\nWe were given a 2 bedroom unit that could sleep up to 5 at no extra cost. The beds didn't sag and there was power near the main bed in one of the rooms. There was also a bigger fridge. This was great!\nHowever, in the 2 bedroom unit there was no hair-dryer, no teatowels, (although we had a sink with no plug), pots and pans, and a hotplate in the cupboard. Seeing as a fire alarm went off at 6.30am Sunday morning from someone cooking in their room we didn't use any of it.\nThere was nowhere to hang or store your clothes unless it was in your suitcase or on the only bed not being used. There was shampoo satchets that resisted being torn open in the shower, whereas in the 1st room the shampoo came in a little bottle. I don't understand the inconsistency in room products.\nThe airconditioning was hit and miss. To get the room above 20° we had to set the thermostat to 30. At times you would get a bit hot but most times it struggled to heat the room. You could feel the cold coming up through the floor.\nI could hear noises and voices coming from other rooms, people in the corridor, doors opening and closing so little to no sound insulation.\nThe extra blanket supplied had someone else's long hair all over it (we both have short hair) and I didn't feel comfortable using it except on the lower end of the bed. This means that they don't check or clean the blankets after use.\n\nThe curtains are wearing through and need to be replaced soon.\n\nThe plus side was great wifi, undercover and locked car accommodation. The staff were respectful and courteous when we did talk to them.\n\nOverall, the place is in need of better management, maintenance and asset replacement. We are not planning on staying there again and I wouldn't recommend it. I gave it a 3 only because we were given the larger room. It didn't not live up to the advertisements and \"Serviced\" should be removed from the name.",

Treatment room was lovely and smelt nice but not overpowering. Nice temperature on a cool Canberra morning. The music did have a crackle which was distracting though!\n\nTreatment was nice. Coffee scrub was ok, but pressure could have been stronger. Lovely shower, with a robe and slippers to wear to the shower and a clean robe and slippers to wear out. Need to top up the soap as it ran out! Lovely massage - probably more relaxing than remedial. But did improve when I asked for stronger pressure. Nice eye mask and use of warm stones, even though it wasn't a hot rock massage. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience and no pressure to buy stuff at all (wasn't even asked) which is extremely refreshing and I'm likely to go back just for that positive experience!",

I'm an Anytime Fitness member and when I asked to use the pool, I was told by the staff member on duty I needed a separate pool membership.\nAlso, the disabling of the water fountains is stupid and will do little to reduce the risk of covid 19 spread. Probably just done to show they're doing something. Most Anytime Fitness gyms keep the fountains on.",

There's a sign that says you need to be clean, have a towel and do not throw water on the coals.  The rules are continually flouted.  The sauna is dominated by males who thinks its their right to come in all sweaty after a workout in their gym outfit and stink up the place with their BO and sweat dripping onto the benches.  What's even worse is the regular patrons would fill their used water bottle with water from the bathroom and throw it onto the coals to generate the steam and humidity.  This is offensive and unhygienic.  No one wants to breathe in someone's spit.  And it's supposed to be a DRY sauna, not a steam room.

The location is good and close to shops and restaurants.\nThe room itself was good, just an average room which was clean and tidy.\nThe service, not so great. Housekeeping only visit your room once every four days which is fine if they actually did a full clean and sheet change. But after returning on day 4 to my room, the sheets weren’t changed, they simply pulled up the existing sheets and remade the bed. Every two days after that, they replaced the towels but didn’t always take away some of the dirty ones. On day eight, the sheets weren’t changed again. This is really unacceptable. Yes it’s not a five star hotel, but housekeeping should at least change the sheets when they come into your room. Also, the room was particularly hot even though I switched off the air conditioning system in the room, there is still a main system that you can’t shut off, And it was ridiculously hot. I develop a very dry throat and skin and a cough over the 10 days. When I queried it, they said there was nothing they could do to change It so I remained uncomfortable.\nFurthermore, one particular reception worker on the Night Shift was completely unhelpful and his manner lazy. He basically fobbed me off and told me to deal with my problem in the morning with the morning staff which I couldn’t do because I had very early commit commitments for work.\n\nThe staff in the restaurant however, were really nice and cooked a great breakfast too.\nI probably wouldn’t recommend this as a place to stay at nor would I choose to stay there again",

On Friday morning I called to see if our cabin could be ready an hour earlier, and the staff were absolutely lovely about it — so polite and friendly over the phone. When we arrived hours earlier than expected, we were fully prepared to wait, but they happily checked us in straight away. Honestly, the staff couldn’t have been more welcoming or helpful.\n\nThe cabin itself was amazing — cheap and cheerful, with everything we needed. It had a full-size fridge, four single beds in two bunk sets, and a separate bedroom with a double bed and wardrobe. There was pantry space and an outdoor area which wasn’t private, but that didn’t bother us as we weren’t there much. The only challenge was keeping our two very young kids away from the road out front. A couple of small improvements that would make a big difference would be adding a washer/dryer and a basic vacuum cleaner. With the wet weather we brought in quite a bit of dirt and debris, and I imagine it would be the same with sand in summer.\n\nThe heated indoor pool was next level — such a huge plus! I really hope Discovery Parks Busselton continues to do well so they can put a bit of money into sprucing up the cabins, but honestly we were stoked with them as they are. We’ll definitely be back in the warmer months! 🌞",

On the first night, the TV in our room did not work. Unfortunately, there was no service crew available until the next morning, meaning after long hours of driving we were unable to relax in our room as expected. Not a great way to start a stay.\n\nOn the second day, after returning from a full day of exploring Canberra, we encountered another major issue. The parking boom gate was not working and would not open. Reception informed us they were unable to fix it and that we would need to wait until the next morning. We were instructed to park in an open area next to a construction site. When I raised safety concerns regarding potential damage or risks from the construction site, the response was dismissive. I was simply told to remove valuables from the car and that the hotel would take no responsibility. While I understand general liability limitations, the complete lack of concern or reassurance was disappointing.\n\nTo make matters worse, when we finally got back to our room hoping to rest, the hot water was not working. Reception advised that the boiler was down and we would need to wait until the next morning for hot water. After a long day, not being able to take a hot shower is unacceptable for a hotel of this standard. Hot water is a basic necessity, not a luxury.\n\nWhat made the experience even more frustrating was the repeated use of stock responses from reception, with no sense of urgency, ownership, or genuine effort to resolve the issues.\n\nThe room itself was fine, but basic services and customer care were severely lacking. Unfortunately, this stay did not meet even the minimum expectations of comfort and service. I would strongly reconsider staying here again and hope management takes these issues seriously.",

However the hotel was hugely apologetic and were accomodating.\n\nIt would be good for them to provide a fresh air space.  If your sensitive to smells its strongly perfumed, its pleasant though.\n\nNo cutlery, only cups and glasses. fridge is more a tiny cooler no freezer i use an esky so no cool today. Its like a student hotel i think, not flash but good to stay in.\n\nLove the setup and simple decor good lighting.The bed was superbig n comfy and i loved looking up at the clouds through the huge window. I had a great sleep and shower which is what its all about.",
