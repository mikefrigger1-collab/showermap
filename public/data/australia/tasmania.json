There was a sign thAT said \"Slide closed\" and i was like well i hope so hahahaha, it would be weird if it was open. But the sign was in the way so i just moved it out the way and started sliding. There was no water on the slide what a rip off, i went so slow and i got burns all over my body, probably didnt help that I forgot to put my clothes back on. Oh well. Once I finally go to the end of the slide. I fell in the water. OUCH. Then I remembered I couldnt swim.

The 25m pool could do with being re-tiled as it is showing its age. The 25m and 50m pools often have lanes booked for school programs, learn to swim, swimming competitions, and water polo competitions which limits access to lanes for casual visitors and members, hence overcrowding, even during off peak periods.\n\nOn a positive, the change rooms are excellent with plenty of shower and toilet cubicles as well as lockers in the members change rooms. The staff are super friendly and helpful, both lifeguards and at reception. The change rooms are cleaned regularly throughout the day, and lifeguards perform regular welfare checks in both the sauna and change room areas. The facility is also trans friendly so members of the LGBTIQ community should feel comfortable coming to this facility.",

I wouldnt recommend staying here at all, and if you get upgraded to powered site 6 with ensuite you'd be better of cancelling your booking",

We received a warm welcome and allocated a site out of wind and close to bathrooms. The site was so pleasant - soft green grass. A few comfortable bare foot days and no dirt in the camper trailer - such a luxury. The camp kitchen is one of the best we’ve seen in 5 months travelling. The bathrooms and laundry were pristine and cleverly laid out with plenty to go around. And there was a separate urinal room for men’s convenience and reduced wet seat comfort. I was put off at first by the reviews commenting on the rules. But they were nothing that other caravan parks don’t give out. I highly recommend this park.",

River is good for a refreshing dip and the off lead dog area at the front of the park is a greato option for dog owners. Great park all in all, definitely recommend.",

It is evident the owners of this charming home take a great deal of pride in providing a comfortable stay for their guests. Steph and Matt go above and beyond in their customer service and care of the home and property. Love the combination of historical decor, antiques and modern amenities plus the abundance of books about this special island, history and things to do. Park on Park is in a great location just a short walk to the grocery store, Daci & Daci patisserie and the beautiful Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens as well as plenty of walking trails nearby. We did not rent a car for the first bit as it is a quick uber ride to downtown plus many sights and attractions including the waterfront and MONA. We had the pleasure of meeting our hosts during our stay and they are both lovely, kind people and an absoulte delight to rent a holiday home from. Well done Matt & Steph! Many thanks!",

It feels like a peaceful, semi-rural escape, yet it’s only 15 minutes from Hobart’s CBD. The caravan sites are spacious and separated by neat hedges for extra privacy – unlike many parks where trailers are crammed together on concrete or dirt slabs.\n\nYou’re surrounded by a touch of bush, and every morning the local wildlife drops by: bandicoots, pademelons, native hens, and magpies, all so friendly they might as well be residents.\n\nThe owners and staff are incredibly warm and welcoming. Stuart and Patrick are the nicest guys you could meet, always up for a chat. Martin, the owner, is a legend for fishing advice and travel tips.\n\nThe amenities are clean and looked after.\n\nPerfect location, great facilities, amazing people – can’t recommend it enough!",

These amenities are at the top of the park, so a bit of a walk to use them.\nThe mobile home section of the park was in the perfect location, the sites are close together, making for a squeezy environment at times.\nWe were having difficulty with the water pressure & we were informed of the problem with the water by the receptionist on arrival. 10ltr cask water is available for purchase ($10). Also when my husband did let them know of the water pressure the problem was fixed promptly.\nOn arrival the receptionist was amazing, so helpful & very informative. We were towing our small Suzuki behind our mobile home & we were informed of their “one vehicle - one code” policy, however the lady allowed us to take our Suzuki to our site to unload our items there. This was wonderful as not only were some items heavy, but the mobile home section was at the far opposite end of the “caravan park’s second car carpark”.\nWe took our Suzuki straight there after unloading & parked it there when not in use.\nUnfortunately the same courtesy was not allowed to us on our vacating the caravan park’s second car. The young female receptionist was very adamant that in no way were we allowed to take our Suzuki into the park, hence my husband & I had to lug our heavy items on several journeys to the car.\nHence the 4 stars.\nThe location is perfect to visit the many locations nearby & 1.5hrs from Hobart.\nOh & the resident bandicoots were a common sight in the evening!",

On the positive side, they did provide basic amenities like toothbrushes and shaving razors, which was appreciated.

Even on the other four days, the other guests were quiet and respectful, so overall it was a pleasant stay.\n\nAlso, the listing says there is free parking, but that’s a bit misleading.\nIn reality, it just means that street parking is free from 6 PM to 10 AM.\nIf you want to park in the actual parking area behind the hostel, it costs $50 per week.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the Wi-Fi is quite weak, so don’t expect much from it.\n\nHowever, one thing that bothered me was that the shower on the far end of the men’s side (the one closest to the car park) barely had any water coming out. I had to check all four showers and use the one with the strongest water pressure each time, which was honestly a bit annoying.\nAlso, the toilet paper kept tearing every time I tried to pull it out, which was quite frustrating.\n\nWhat really annoyed me the most was about the refund.\nI booked for two weeks but had to leave after one week because I found farm work. The day before check-out, one of the staff helped me calculate the refund — around $400 including accommodation and parking fees. They told me to ask the manager, Jon, about it when checking out.\nBut when I talked to Jon on the check-out day, I only got about $190 back.\n\nIt’s simple math — just divide the total two-week accommodation fee by 14 to get the daily rate, then multiply by 7 for the unused week, plus $50 for parking (I had paid $100 for two weeks).\nI was honestly surprised that such a basic calculation couldn’t be done properly.\n\nSo my advice is: if you plan to stay here, book for a shorter period first and extend later if needed.\nThat way, you won’t lose money like I did 😁\nHobart is a lovely place, so enjoy your stay!",

Overall I enjoyed it. A few points that you might not take into account before arrival - there is no elevator, so if you have a heavy suitcase it is difficult to go upstairs. If there is an option, you can use the lovely staff who provide a solution to everything. During my stay there was only one dryer that worked, which should also be taken into account if you need to do a laundry. Overall my stay there was fine, especially in private rooms with a shower and toilet.\nThere was some smell of sewage or mold in my last room ,better to check it in private room.There is one small kitchen,but enough room for everyone.The hostel also provides some facilities such as free pizza night and platypus tour or pub crawl.\nIn general I'm glad that I chooce this hostel,especialy because of the kind staff.",

          "reviewText": "A lovely hostel, I made a reservation before and after my booked tour with Under Down Under in Tasmania and also spent several nights there during the tour. Overall I enjoyed it. A few points that you might not take into account before arrival - there is no elevator, so if you have a heavy suitcase it is difficult to go upstairs. If there is an option, you can use the lovely staff who provide a solution to everything. During my stay there was only one dryer that worked, which should also be taken into account if you need to do a laundry.

The owner was friendly and accommodating, and was very approachable the couple of times we dealt with him. The room was small but that was to be expected from a hostel. The room didn't get any signal for the free WiFi, which was an inconvenience. The toilet seat was a little dicky and as such moved around while in use. The shower cut in and out making it difficult and unpleasant to use. The room wasn't cleaned very well; the sheets smelt like old lady perfume, there was used soap with other people's hair on it in the shower, there was dust and dirt under the bed, and the small heater smelt when on due to the dust caked on it. There was a lovely skylight which was the only source of natural light in the room but the blinds covering it didn't shut properly so let in the early morning light. There was no parking at the hostel so I had to pay for street parking, which got a bit expensive. For a private double bed room with tiny bathroom I was charged $64, which after experiencing the hostel is too expensive for the quality of the room. There was an option when booking to request a quiet room, however I didn't sleep much due to the people in the room next to us making noise throughout the night and early hours of the morning. Overall I wasn't very impressed with the hostel itself. There is much room for improvement.",

Only positive thing is the location and the clean sheets.\n\nThere's a lack of space for any luggage, only a tiny locker and no other luggage room to store anything bigger than a back pack.\n\nThe bathrooms were not clean and bins were never emptied. No towel provided either which is the least I would expect from a capsule hotel.\n\nThe only communal space was the kitchen which is at the front of the building with full glass front looking out into the street so did not feel very private or relaxed.\n\nTrying to sleep was also a disaster as their was no soundproofing in the very small sleeping pods. I could easily hear people walking along the corridors throughout the night.\n\nI will definitely not be staying here again and as capsule hotels go this has got the worst reputation.",

First off, the capsules are ridiculously cramped. I’m a petite person, and even I felt like I was suffocating in there. The bed is hard as a rock, and I could feel every single spring in the mattress. Definitely not what I expected for the price.\n\nThe so-called \"privacy\" is a joke. The thin, flimsy curtain that separates you from the next capsule offers zero soundproofing, so I could hear every single conversation and even snoring from the other guests. It made getting any sleep nearly impossible.\n\nThe cleanliness was also a huge issue. There were stains on the bedding, and the bathroom was filthy. I understand these are budget accommodations, but hygiene should still be a priority. The communal showers felt like a public pool locker room—sticky floors and awful lighting.\n\nAdditionally, the staff seemed disinterested and unfriendly, barely acknowledging my presence when I checked in. For a place that bills itself as a “convenient” option, it’s definitely not worth the price you pay. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you're looking for comfort, cleanliness, or a peaceful night’s sleep.Filthy toilets.",

My 5 year old couldn’t get up most of the trap doors maybe make them bigger than a 3 year old size. The rock climbing was great. The staff was friendly & nice. It was the first time entering the place so I had to fill out a waver form for my youngest 2 kids. To go rock climbing you will need to also hire a harness what costs $6. They also have two party rooms for the kids. There was a party on when I was there and it looked well set up with an assistant staff member to monitor the kids and to look after them. It’s changed names number is of times, at the present it’s looking okay set up, the building is very old, maybe a extra signage out the front would help with people who can’t access, Google Maps or navigation system. The cafeteria was nice clothing, coffees, soft drinks, toastie‘s and confectionery for the young ones nice rest areas including clean, toilets, lockers, and drawers and cupboards to put your bags and boots in with security cameras, watching them 24/7. I’m racing at four stars. Kids had a ball. I didn’t mind a rock climb after 10 years.",

All the staff are friendly, professional, and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Whether you're there for a treatment or just to enjoy the spa amenities, it’s a top-tier experience every time. Highly recommend becoming a member if you value your wellness routine",

I had Sammy as my therapist and she looked after me professionally and I felt comfortable in her hands. Sammy is passionate about what she does and is very knowledgeable. I returned to the Day Spa later in the week (today) and enjoyed a swim in the magnesium pool, a detoxifying sauna along with the steam room too. The facilities are excellent and the towels supplied for use are welcome for the sauna and steam room areas. There are water stations, so I kept myself hydrated, and the change rooms are well appointed, and everything feels clean and inviting. I hope I get a chance to come back again and I feel confident in recommending the Savoy Day Spa to others and trust you will have a beautiful, relaxing experience too.",

I'm sitting there in my shorts, feeling like I've accidentally wandered into a Vogue photoshoot. The air smells like a garden exploded in a good way, and the decor? Mate, it's like a minimalist's wet dream.\n\nThen the massage. Turns out, they know what they're doing. Knotted me up like a pretzel, and untangled me like a magician with a rope trick. Honestly, I reckon this place is basically a feminist utopia. They've got the whole \"pamper yourself\" thing down to a science. Me? I was just happy to get a decent back rub without smelling like a locker room afterwards.\n\nIf you're a lady who likes nice things, or even a bloke who accidentally stumbled into a high-end cloud, Lavada's worth a visit. 5 out of 5, would recommend, even if you're just there to figure out what all those fancy smells are.",

I found the online booking service was very easy.\nAs soon as I walked in, surveyed the reception desk and met Michelle I was immediately confident that I was in for a truly positive experience.\nThe rooms all have solid walls and doorways making for a completely individual treatment. No noise or interference from anything outside the room. Sooooo important.\n\nI travel around Australia full time in my caravan with barely any access to a bath or luxury bathroom facilities so I decided to go all out and have the Detox Spa Journey at $399.\n\nMy spa session with Michelle was truly amazing. And I mean that sincerely. She was so attentive, caring and gentle. Which was imperative after my leg surgery last month. I couldn’t have randomly chosen a better therapist if I tried. (no reflection on the other staff)\n\nAfter being sublimely exfoliated then wrapped in a clay cocoon during a deeply relaxing head massage, Michelle remained in the room just outside the shower making sure that I was safe and didn’t get too wobbly with my new knee (I use a walking stick). This clearly illustrated to me an exceptional level of caring over and above the usual for me as a client.\n\nThe products used during the entire process including the one hour moisturising massage were excellent. I felt extremely soft skinned and smooth. On completion of my treatment I felt calm, relaxed and light as a feather.\n\nMichelle’s attention to me as a client was nothing short of perfect. As someone who has had 100s of massages and dozens of spa visits over the last 30 years I found this experience absolutely faultless. Michelle is a client-centred professional and definitely a person who is particularly suited to her career as a spa therapist.\n\nI could not have been more delighted with my time at LAVADA and would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a personal and professional, heavenly spa experience.",

Rust on the lights and the showers look like they have been there since the place opened. Charging $3.40 for a locker is disgusting since there is no where to keep your belongings safe. Most days there aren’t enough lanes available for people to swim safely. Needs a massive upgrade and a membership program for people who swim for fitness so it’s not so expensive.",

Nothing was stolen because my valuables were in a smaller pocket. But I told the receptionist about this in case they could warn the other pool goers that a thief was about, or check the security footage and discreetly ask the individual to leave.\n\nHowever, I was told that they know about thieves, it’s a common problem, and they only send security footage to the police if something actually gets stolen. The receptionist’s attitude was rather rude and dismissive, as if I was the problem, and that I was making her life harder by trying to help others not have their valuables stolen.\n\nI’m honestly surprised that, if the pool knows this is a common problem, they don’t have warning signs up or strictly advise patrons use the lockers.",

And read other reviews for not only for this Zap Fitness but others - people (particularly women) are very uncomfortable about being exposed to the general public, some feel unsafe and they don't feel like they should be put on display to promote your gym.

Every movement causes creaking and squeaking. The pods are fully sound-permeable — conversations, coughing, snoring, doors, cupboards and other guests’ activities are audible without any damping. Even with earplugs, sleep was severely disrupted.\n\nVentilation inside the pods is inadequate. There is a loud fan installed somewhere above the ceiling panels, but when the pod door is closed there is almost no proper air circulation. It becomes warm, stuffy, and unpleasant. There is no air conditioning. Pod doors cannot be locked; staff explained this is due to fire regulations, which effectively means anyone can access your pod. Guests are advised not to leave valuables inside.\n\nBedding was clean. However, the pods themselves are clearly aged and poorly maintained. Many show signs of patch repairs, adhesive residue on the shells, and general wear.\n\nEach guest is provided with a small locker next to the pod. These lockers are too small to fit any suitcase; luggage must be stored in a separate, unsecured room. As a result, guests must keep clothing and toiletries in the small locker. There are no changing rooms. Changing is only possible either in the corridor or while lying inside the pod. Many lockers are damaged, partially broken, or poorly repaired.\n\nCleanliness is a major issue. Under the pods, cleaning is clearly neglected. Visible debris included underwear, socks, toenail clippings, food remnants, and heavy dust accumulation.\n\nThe bathroom facilities are completely inadequate for the number of guests. The men’s bathroom has only two sinks for the entire hotel. For most of the time, the area was visibly dirty, with water all over the floor. The hair dryer was sticky and appeared never to have been cleaned.\n\nThe showers are in unacceptable condition: visible mould on the walls in all three showers, a persistent musty smell, and overall hygiene that can reasonably be described as a health concern. Touching surfaces is strongly discouraged; footwear is essential. Toilet seats were frequently covered in urine.\n\nThe guest mix is extremely broad, which is not a problem in itself, but combined with the pod concept it creates significant issues. Guests appear to assume privacy within their capsule and behave accordingly — phone calls, conversations, laughing, coughing, snoring, and sexual activity occurred throughout the night. Noise never fully subsided. If even one guest is noisy, the entire room is affected.\n\nWe expected an innovative, futuristic sleeping experience. The reality was the complete opposite. Sleep quality was among the worst we have experienced. We would choose a shared hostel dorm over this concept, as behaviour there is at least visible and socially regulated.\n\nWe cannot understand the high number of positive reviews. The only positive aspect was that it provided shelter from sleeping outside.",

The spa heating was broken, and the heated pool wasn't very warm, which was a bit disappointing but overall I am satisfied with the price point of the lodgings.\n\nAreas for improvement: It would be nice if the cupboard contained extra pillows and blankets, so we don't have to ask for them, as the reception is still mostly unattended. Would also be good if the cupboard contained a broom and dustpan, so we could give the floor a quick clean, as we stayed there for a week and it didn't seem that our room was swept for the whole 7 days we were there.\n\nWe ran out of toilet paper, so the replenishment of consumables in the rooms needs to have a bit more attention as well as the towels not being replaced every day. It would also be handy to have more towels for the pool. How can you have one towel per person? We wet the towel when we get out of the pool, how do we dry ourselves when we get out of the shower later (or vice versa)?\n\nThe room we were in had a lovely view but the hedge needed trimming because the new shoots were getting tall and blocking the view.\n\nAll in all, it was a good stay and I wouldn't hesitate to book again. I can see that the management are taking feedback on board, so please continue to do so and good luck with the rest of the renovations.",

The spa heating was broken, and the heated pool wasn't very warm, which was a bit disappointing but overall I am satisfied with the price point of the lodgings.\n\nAreas for improvement: It would be nice if the cupboard contained extra pillows and blankets, so we don't have to ask for them, as the reception is still mostly unattended. Would also be good if the cupboard contained a broom and dustpan, so we could give the floor a quick clean, as we stayed there for a week and it didn't seem that our room was swept for the whole 7 days we were there.\n\nWe ran out of toilet paper, so the replenishment of consumables in the rooms needs to have a bit more attention as well as the towels not being replaced every day. It would also be handy to have more towels for the pool. How can you have one towel per person? We wet the towel when we get out of the pool, how do we dry ourselves when we get out of the shower later (or vice versa)?\n\nThe room we were in had a lovely view but the hedge needed trimming because the new shoots were getting tall and blocking the view.\n\nAll in all, it was a good stay and I wouldn't hesitate to book again. I can see that the management are taking feedback on board, so please continue to do so and good luck with the rest of the renovations.",

When we told her we simply followed the spot she marked on the map and that this wasn't our fault, she dismissively told us \"I can't show each location to the visitors.\"\n​She then forced us to move to a new spot that her map claimed had a fire pit. We moved everything, only to find there was no fire pit there. She didn't even bother to apologize for the mix-up or her laziness.

We weren't too impressed with the amount of people that think it's perfectly alright to just walk through your campsite, or the attitude when we questioned it, I guess that's how it is back home for them. Price is reasonable. The showers and toilets are serviceable, and no extra cost. The hand dryers aren't heated, which was less than pleasant, combined with the cold water, when washing my arthritic hands in the cooler months. But that's only a minor gripe. Some people need fire safety education. Leaving fires that are well and truly going when vacating a site isn't really very clever, even it is by a river. Also, cans don't burn. We'll probably camp here again, but definitely not during school holidays. We imagine it would be pretty well patronised then. Especially as you can have up to 10 people to a site. $21 for up to 2, $5 extra per person. Must vacate by 10am, unless previously arranged. Not all sites have fireplaces, which are extra, but you can bring a firepot/stove as long as it doesn't sit straight on the grass, and of course it's not during restrictions. Also on the subject of fires, there's ample signage with conditions of use of the park, and one of those conditions is about where you can, and can't light a fire. It seems that a lot of people either don't comprehend English, or willfully ignore it when they just light their fire on the ground. I'm sure those same people wouldn't be impressed if their visitors did that to their lawn at home. It doesn't add to the charm of the place, random piles of charcoal and stones, that is. Great for little kids to play in. Plenty of room for the little uns to burn off energy, including a playground. Dog friendly. Camp kitchen, electric BBQs. A kiosk. There's plenty to like.\n\nUpdate.\n\nWe have been here during school holidays, and it was a long weekend. Yes it was packed, but, at least the site we were at, there's plenty of space between sites, and it's not too bad. Yes you get the occasional squealing kids, but where don't you. Expect to have to book well in advance in those times though, at least if you want to be able to pick your favourite spot. River frontage is premium, and goes fast.",

Firepits and wood available. Hot showers cost $1 for 5 minutes. Park is located 3kms from Mole Creek township which boasts a pub, fuel stop and a local takeaway. Cradle mountain, Sheffield, Devil's Gullet and Mole Creek caves are all within striking distance of the park. Devonport approximately 1 hour away, with Deloraine around a 30 minute drive.

Firepits and wood available. Hot showers cost $1 for 5 minutes. Park is located 3kms from Mole Creek township which boasts a pub, fuel stop and a local takeaway. Cradle mountain, Sheffield, Devil's Gullet and Mole Creek caves are all within striking distance of the park. Devonport approximately 1 hour away, with Deloraine around a 30 minute drive.

Within reach of local towns to top up on your supplies. The owners where really friendly and gave us a great campsite (no.3) and we were very lucky to see two platypuses in the creek druing our stay. A highly recommend campsite.",

In total we spent 10 nights.\n\nThe sites are larger, grassed and fairly flat. Some have sea views and others are protected by bushes and growth. Power and water is $40/night for 2 adults, you get discounts with longer stays. The amenities are great, newer and very clean. Individual toilet and shower cubicles. $1/7 minutes shower with good water pressure. Laundry is $3/wash and $3/dry plus have nice outdoor drying area. The kitchen is great. 2 fridges, 2 4 burner electric cook tops, 2 sinks and 2 outdoor BBQs. Again, spotless.\n\nThere is a nice pathway for walks, easy access to the beach. You can see penguins on the beach and they often come into the park. It's also easy to walk into town centre or local business area.\n\nAngelina and Patrick were great to deal with. Always made us feel welcome and never made us feel like it was an inconvenience for extensions, even on super busy long weekends,  and answered any questions we had. They made it hard to leave, thanks again!. We would happily stay again if in the area",

The location was excellent - on the river, lots of parking, and next to a PHENOMENAL all-ages playground.\nRoom was extremely spacious and clean - we stayed in one of the old silo rooms with the curved concrete wall? Peppers had made up a roller bed for our 8 year old which was appreciated. Bathroom was enormous with very large walk in shower and separated toilet cubicle as well as all usual amenities. The touches of natural finishes in the room and hotel was a nice Tassie vibe.\nThe restaurant was a standout. We had dinner there only one of the two nights, and every dish was perfect. We had each of the specials (2 x entrees, 2 x mains) and our picky eating child ordered a second serving of the kids fish and chips after finishing the first one. Service was friendly but not overbearing, swift and professional. Not cheap, but it was one of the best dinners we have had in years.\nWill be highly recommending Peppers Silo Hotel at Launceston to others, and probably be back there ourselves again next year.",

You'll be too busy sweating in the sauna and showers to even think about escaping in case of an emergency. That's just a minor detail, right?\n\nBut let's talk about the real reason you're here: the exercise. Let me tell you, my muscles have never been so swollen and bulging as they are after a workout at Zap. The weights practically lift themselves when I'm there. I think it might be the special air they pump in that gives me superhuman strength. Or maybe it's the unicorn tears they sprinkle on the equipment.\n\nAnd the best part? The membership price! It's practically a steal compared to other gyms that charge an arm and a leg for the same mediocre workout experience. I mean, sure, you might have to sacrifice a limb or two to get out of the sauna in case of a fire, but at least you're not sacrificing your wallet for a gym membership.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Zap Gym to anyone who wants to feel like a Greek god or goddess. Just don't forget to bring a fire extinguisher and a towel, because things can get pretty hot in there. But hey, that's just part of the fun, right?",

So, this is a big deal!\n\nToday is the first day that I have used the Cérge app to book a visit to Splash Devonport Aquatic and Leisure Centre. Normally with myself being a double aka (above knee amputee) in an electric wheelchair I can often find I am a bit apprehensive going to new places. I’m never quite sure if the new places I’m going to will be suitable for my needs and if arrive and then must just go home.\n\nIt’s a bit annoying and anxiety inducing.\nA lot of businesses I have been to previously don’t have sufficient\nroom to manoeuvre around in a big wheelchair like mine, I would\nsteer clear of venues like this. I have found some not suitable to\nmy needs which can be quite off putting and disappointing. I was\nvery excited to see Cérge has its very own Access and Inclusion\nguide with a visual story.\n\nSo, I looked at that before going. I was able to see photos of the\ndoorways, the pathways, entrances, everything! There as so much information it was excellent.\n\nBeing the first time using Cérge I wasn’t sure how it would all go,\nbut I found the app quite easy to use and I shouldn’t have\nworried. I guess I’ve just had so many disappointing experiences in the past.\n\nI arrived at Splash and welcomed by Hamish who made me feel\nvery at ease and was able to give me a full tour of the facilities. Let me tell you Splash is a great place with many pools and a\nhydrotherapy pool which is accessible by their own wheelchairs,\nwith the use of a hoist. A sling in the spacious changing room that has plenty of wheelchair access. After seeing all the equipment I’m confident enough to know now that it will be no problem for me and my carer to visit in the future and I can now add swimming into my life.\n\nThey also have a full leisure centre with many different exercise\nclasses and a huge fully equipped gym.\nI have found in the past that I can feel a little unsettled as I don’t\nfeel welcome and not always seen if that makes sense, as well as some places aren’t set up for wheelchairs and people with\ndisability like myself.\n\nHowever, that was something I did not have to worry about today,\nI felt welcomed and included thanks to Hamish who answered all\nmy questions and showed me around the whole facilities at\nSplash.\n\nI hope more business will start using and offering Cérge in the\ncommunity. Being on the app, it shows me you are trying and you\ncare. There is nothing else like it that I have come across. I know\nthat myself and so many others who have any disability or\nrestrictions will find the Cérge a benefit.\n\nIf Cérge was in every business just like EFTPOS is I know I would\nhave more confidence in experiencing different places that in the\npast I may never would tried. This helps me have a fuller life and\nmore things to do and that is very exciting!",

Pros - well, non you can’t get in another million places in Australia, the owner says & quote - it would cost a fortune to not have hot water timers unquote. So to that I think, well every other state has no problem, but they did give me a wave from their 120k tricked up 4WD🤕\nadd to that the sign in the ammenities that reads - Feel free to wipe down the benches, now ask yourself why it would be written like that, as a Phycologist I can ashore you the hot water mentality showcases what the park management thinks of its guests, so again Avoid.\nPs- the sign on the back of the shower door says - Please turn taps off. Now the reason it says that is due to the hot water stopping, it does not just get cold it stops altogether, so if they have not been turned off and you push the button then get ready for a burst of cold water, keep in mind your already freezing, so the previous person hasn’t turned off the tap, but can you blame them, all they are doing is reaching for cloths to get warm, yeah big avoid",

Pros - well, non you can’t get in another million places in Australia, the owner says & quote - it would cost a fortune to not have hot water timers unquote. So to that I think, well every other state has no problem, but they did give me a wave from their 120k tricked up 4WD🤕\nadd to that the sign in the ammenities that reads - Feel free to wipe down the benches, now ask yourself why it would be written like that, as a Phycologist I can ashore you the hot water mentality showcases what the park management thinks of its guests, so again Avoid.\nPs- the sign on the back of the shower door says - Please turn taps off. Now the reason it says that is due to the hot water stopping, it does not just get cold it stops altogether, so if they have not been turned off and you push the button then get ready for a burst of cold water, keep in mind your already freezing, so the previous person hasn’t turned off the tap, but can you blame them, all they are doing is reaching for cloths to get warm, yeah big avoid",

We have called up today (30th of November) to discuss what time would be best for us to come and pay our security deposit/ move in tomorrow and have been met with hostility and false words. Craig has started ignoring our calls and when I called the front desk I spoke with a very nasty woman named Sheryl who not only speaks in a disgusting manner to customers but blatantly was disrespectful and was claiming we had to double the deposit that was agreed upon with Craig 5 days prior. Then Sheryl said that I need to call back tomorrow (the day we were told to arrive to move in) because apparently they aren’t open on a Sunday, even though she answered my call at the front office and they are operating today. Then when I tried to speak about what Craig had said to us prior about moving in she hung up in an extremely rude manner after talking over top of me and telling me I was a rude person for only trying to get in contact when the owners were ignoring my calls.\n\n0 stars, do not stay here if you value common decency and honesty. The park owners and operators are liars and like to toy with peoples lives for amusement then dodge your calls to avoid responsibility for their actions. We have since declined other living situations because we had been told we could move in on the Monday and now apparently we were declined for no reason other than a few days had passed since the agreement was made.\nVery putrid, wishy-washy and unprofessional behaviour from a customer based establishment.",

The restaurant gave us mixed msgs with the waitresses mentioning they were open for brekkie on Xmas day, but seemed to be closed when we went there. Overall it was a good experience, as the location is fantastic and plenty of outdoor things to do.",

Advertised for 4 people, but there was only one towel rail, no table and you couldn't sit on the couch if someone was standing by the sink the room was so small. The basin was so small that you literally couldn't even fit a toothpaste tube on it. Not even a box of tissues, just a handbag pack of 10. 'Golf side villa' and we had a view of a pine tree right out the door. No extra pillows would have been handy, Kmart electric blankets and a lot of wall damage. The pool and sauna are screaming for upgrades. The ceiling was leaking, theres mould around the doors and the spa looked green. Wasn't brave enough to get in. Restaurant was nice but overpriced. Nice area for families, but im not sure I'd rush back to the accommodation.",

Splash Golf was new to us and very exciting would recommend.\nThe Stores are lovely and the people who work at the place a genuine and nice.\nThe main issues I had with the resort is the pool.\nThe pool needs to be revamped completely the hot tub was semi gross didn't look clean. The sauna room smells like wet Goat and the changing rooms although had clearly had some upgrades. the doors leading into the rooms had some rust and paint coming off. The BLACK MOLD on the tiles of the wall near the pool and up in the skylight glass above the pool is a clear health and safety problem. Besides the bad there is good. The swim was fun wouldn't personally put my head under this particular pool water but still enjoyed the swim. Definitely revamp the pool. Overall Rooms expirence in the room was good besides the touchy shower and the TV having so many streaming services the most I've ever seen at a hotel resort but no hotel accounts to watch any of the streaming services. the atmosphere of the room was great it definitely is what you pay for when it comes to the bed it was comfortable. Would I recommend this place for family's yes. I personally don't feel like I would stay more than 2 nights for just a couple but overall 7/10.",

I got there and spoke to the onsite manager, told him I was concerned and he reassured me the room would be spotless. Any problems and he will sort it immediately.\nWe got a 3 bedroom family room, it was clean, freshly painted and the bedrooms were large. There was window seats in the rooms, so cool and in the main room we had chairs and a little coffee table. The layout was unique and we liked it. Bathroom was tiny but the shower head and water pressure was awesome. Kitchenette was usable but nothing to write home about. Beds were comfy but could definitely use extra pillows. Pillows we had were flat and 1 per head. That would really be my only complaint. If we had stayed more then 1 night I would have asked for more pillows. There is a kids playground, it could use an upgrade but in all honestly it was kinda cool. Full timber playground with a metal slide. None of that fancy plastic. My kids loved it and reminded me of my childhood.\nIf you need somewhere to stay with more space then the average place then give it a go.    I hope they do well in the future.",

The whole building felt unpleasantly cold overall there was another lady in the waiting room sitting with a blanket over her. I asked the therapist if we could turn the heater up as I was cold but she said it was at the max and had been on since the morning.

Instead, you’re left with filling your water bottle from the bathroom tap, which is just unacceptable for any gym.\n\nThe changing facilities are another issue. There are two rooms: one large and somewhat acceptable, but if that’s in use, you’re forced into a cramped space that is a converted toilet stall next to the literal toilet stalls. The lighting is on a sensor, which turns off after a few minutes. So, you’ll find yourself in the shower, naked and scrambling to get dry and dressed in the dark, with just one hook for your belongings.\n\nThe sound system is a joke. With only a few large speakers scattered around, the volume can be overpowering if you’re near one, drowning out your headphones. And when the music randomly stops, you’re left in an awkward silence in a gym setting.\n\nThen there’s the sauna—a total disaster. It’s never clean, with only an old rag available for wiping down surfaces. The booking system involves writing your name on a whiteboard, making it easy for someone to erase your reservation. I often found the sauna turned off, and after two months of my membership, it was broken entirely.\n\nWhen I raised these concerns with the staff, I was told that the owner, Anthony, would address them when he gets back from a holiday in Europe.

It was 95% very clean but there were a few small, annoying things like a broken slat in the blind which allowed the room to be lit up by a street light, which did impact on comfort. The apartment we stayed in was roomy and we'll put together. There was plenty of seating in the lounge area and at the table. The kitchen had pretty much everything you need. There was even ice in the freezer. We had take away but you could easily cook a homestyle meal here. There was plenty of bedding, pillows, towels, extra blankets. Some soap was supplied. I highly recommend checking in earlier than 5pm, especially in winter.",

We had only planned to stay one night but ended up staying four, that's how much we loved it.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly managers. Their kindness and generosity made us feel at home right away. The facilities are spotless and well-maintained. Every morning, one of the managers takes great care of the amenities to keep everything clean and tidy.\n\nWe also had several breakfasts at the little café next to the campground, and it was absolutely delicious, great food at very reasonable prices. The value for money here is excellent overall.\n\nAnd how could we forget the resident chicken who stole our hearts? Every morning and evening, she came to greet us and even followed us around the campground. Such a sweet and unexpected companion.\n\nThank you again for your warm hospitality and all the helpful advice you shared with us during our stay. If you're looking for a peaceful, welcoming spot to rest during your travels, we couldn't recommend this place more. A true gem full of warmth and serenity.\n\nAna and Bastien",

Furniture was old and damaged dining chairs have wobbly legs we couldn’t sit on a couple of them as they swayed. All the vinyl is torn, really shabby. Needs proper bathmats as shower and bathroom so slippery. Not great for elderly people because of the above.\n\nBeds comfortable. .but all of us have bites on our necks and faces so possibly bedbugs",

First day advised the office lady of the slow draining sink in the bathroom and was told the owners were coming in two weeks and they would deal with it then. Had to brush our teeth in the shower, took me 5 minutes to clean the sink after a shave.\nIf the Bates Motel or the Guest House Paradiso was up the road,they would be a far better place to stay.\nNot sure why people have given 4 and 5 star ratings, 🤔 possibly friends and family.",
