To pay $7 and have a meagre portion of a half lane available for a child to swim in is a rip off.\nI was at the pool with my 3 year old grandson. I want to SWIM with him, so the shallow paddling pool is of no use. The shallow swimming pool was 99% occupied by swim school as was 50% of the larger pool. The other 50% taken up by elderly walkers who scowl at young kids being in the lane. I have attached a picture of the quarter lane available for public use by toddler swimmers.\nThe outdoor area was not upgraded at all. It is still fully exposed to the elements making it mostly unusable\nThe showers have no way of  regulating the water temperature, which is too hot for kids.\nVery disappointing.

Anyway, I just didn't let it get to me and continued into the water. At first, I was having time of my life because no one was there! But soon enough I felt something in the water with me! It was kind of dark so I couldn't really see, I squinted really hard and realised that there was a staff member behind me trying to fish me out with the pool cleaner!!!!! It was fine though because the pool was too wet anyway, disgusting right? Then I made my way to the sauna, but when I got in it was too hot! Like 20 degrees! Are they trying to kill me!? So, I tried to escape, buy the door was locked!? So, I just sat down, and it was actually really relaxing because they started playing some nice music for me! And also, they put on some fun red and blue lighting! But it started hurting my eyes because it was flashing too much. Then a policeman unlocked the door and escorted me to the exit! SO RUDE. Since when was the pool shut!? What pool shuts at 3AM!? Basically, DON'T COME HERE. They even made me put clothes on and said I couldn't swim unless I had a swimming cap because apparently they didn't want the red dye in my hair all over the pool.",

The water temperature is always just right, and there are plenty of lanes available for swimmers of all levels. I really appreciate how the lanes are clearly marked for different speeds, which makes lap swimming smooth and enjoyable without the stress of overcrowding.\n\nThere’s also a great program pool that’s perfect for lessons or gentle exercise, plus a kids’ pool and spa/sauna facilities that make it a full experience rather than just a swim. It’s a genuine all-rounder.\n\nThe lifeguards and staff are excellent — professional, attentive, and friendly. You always feel safe knowing the pool deck is properly supervised. The staff at reception are equally welcoming and efficient, making the whole experience easy from the moment you walk in.\n\nThe centre itself is well equipped, with modern change rooms, lockers, and showers that are clean and functional. It’s clearly looked after with care, which makes a big difference for regular swimmers.\n\nWhat I love most is that Richmond Rec Centre really feels like a hub for the community. There are people of all ages and abilities using the facilities, and the atmosphere is always positive and inclusive. Whether you’re training seriously or just dipping in for some light exercise, it’s a place where everyone fits in.\n\nRichmond Recreation Centre pool is an asset to the area — reliable, welcoming, and consistently excellent.

Just be patient!)\n\nMaybe management could put up some signage explaining sauna courtesy.\n\nThe change room showers are also not ideal, being too cramped, sometimes dirty and often no hot water.

I have been coming here for ten years for swimming lessons. It is incredibly hot inside as a spectator (which I have no option not to be because my kids are having lessons). They don’t seem to operate any air conditioning or even fans half the time. It’s the beginning of March and I didn’t see any fans in February. It’s even boiling in winter in the pool to have to watch your kids at swimming lessons.\nStaff say no one complains about the pool temperature? Come on, that’s ridiculous, I have been here ten years and plenty of people do find the pool atmosphere too hot. Also the toilets / change areas in the pool are a mess. I expect them to be a little messy but I’ve given up showering my kids here at all after being confronted with piles of pubic hair on the floor several times recently. I know it’s hard to keep public toilets clean with high foot traffic but that’s a bit much.\nAgain your gym is great. Your overall facility it great. Your pool not great not even good.\nEdit - swimming lessons used to be mainly ok but have gone down hill. Putting kids back in the kiddie pool to prioritise more open lanes for the public? It is what it is and public need room too but it shows a lower priority for swimming lesson customers but we are still charged same price. The older kids do four strokes of the kiddie pool and hit the other end or are made swim around in a square for a longer lap because there is no room. Just not that stimulating for them or helping with stamina",

Couldn't find a cheaper day pass in the area. Has a few racks and areas to deadlift. Lots of fans and the temp was pretty good. Not too crowded. As far as complaints go, there aren't many. I did trip more than once on the elevation change going towards the locker room. Some bright tape or paint would really help on those sloped rubber mats. Some equipment is pretty well used, but it's manageable. The setup for weights near the deadlift platform was odd, just a bunch of 15 kg plates, so I had to steal some heavier plates from a nearby rack that luckily wasn't being used. Came here twice while visiting. I'd recommend it.",

Couldn't find a cheaper day pass in the area. Has a few racks and areas to deadlift. Lots of fans and the temp was pretty good. Not too crowded. As far as complaints go, there aren't many. I did trip more than once on the elevation change going towards the locker room. Some bright tape or paint would really help on those sloped rubber mats. Some equipment is pretty well used, but it's manageable. The setup for weights near the deadlift platform was odd, just a bunch of 15 kg plates, so I had to steal some heavier plates from a nearby rack that luckily wasn't being used. Came here twice while visiting. I'd recommend it.",

Staff were friendly, helpful, and approachable. Amenities were clean, spacious, and bright. The equipment and space throughout were all top notch. As a powerlifter I was impressed by the specialised equipment on hand- rogue and eleiko bars and plates, plenty of excellent racks, benches, and platforms. Body builders would be happy here too though with plenty of dbs, lots of equipment, and reminders of visits from Coleman and Schwarzenegger. Super interesting architecture also being in the banana alley vaults/ viaduct buildings with trains going overhead. 10/10 would recommend and I'll be visiting again when I'm next in town",

Rarely have to wait for someone to finish (especially if youre training legs), but sometimes can be a short wait for barbell bench press.

My main complaint is with hygiene. There's never soap in the toilets. Ive brought it up a few times with reception but it seems to be an ongoing issue.

The room is very old, smelt like cigarette upon arrival, shower head was leaking, towels had stains on them, air con couldn’t be used because of the smoke smell coming through it and the toilet roll holder kept falling off so this truely is a ‘3 star’ motel. Booking process was easy, rooms are secured with a PIN code which is a nice touch. Customer service was nice and someone was at reception (10pm) when we checked in. The area is a little bit ‘how ya going’, the police were even there at 3am, but overall it’s an okay place to get you out of trouble for the night and is reasonably priced! ☺️",

I asked the first day we arrived if it would be ready the next day and they confirmed, but in the end it wasn't. No notice given. Amenities were being renovated. What was really annoying was our second stay and it was mainly thanks to one fussy lady at reception. Upon arrival she asked to see my husband who booked our stay. I had his passport with me but she still demanded to see him in person. Did not happen the first time we checked in here. Next,  I was using the laundry and one of the washing machines came up with an error after I paid. So went back to reception to ask for a refund and use a different machine. That same lady told me she could only give a refund once she had seen our bank statement. I showed her the transaction, which said approved, not pending or canceled. In the end I did not bother to go back again with our bank statements and simply popped our washing into a different machine. That is not the way to make customers or to keep them. Sites are rather small due to location. Lots of cars parked on street or blocking pathways. Kitchen has induction, lots of people including ourselves experiencing issues as only few pots/pans work. On our second stay amenities were open again and looked quite nice, showers were not hot, though. The ensuite amenities do not have enough hooks or shelves but hot water",

Whilst I booked several nights earlier with my rooftop tent, which was great and affordable as they have amenities and a good camp kitchen.. I also enjoyed my stay at the studio cabin, which was unbelievably comfortable as anything I could’ve wished was there! Parking in front, Queen size bed with lovely fresh linen, a clean compact bathroom with ample of different seized towels, a well equipped kitchen so I could cook at “home” and a good small fridge. I watched television in the evening and had a wonderful sleep in the quietness of this great holiday park so close to the delights of city and surrounding suburbs. The shops are only 1km from this park so I was happy to top up and relax here for an overnight stay. I like the boom gate code which allows me to come and go anytime, after hours is a problem from the past - thank you for making me feel welcome 😊",

The permanent residents are lovely. The campsite itself is nice and quiet. Super clean toilets/showers and the best hot showers we’ve had. (Travelled from cairns to Melbourne).\nThe caretakers made us feel really welcome. Price is great for $15 per person per night. Great laundry facilities and camp kitchen too! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to visit Melbourne, it’s only a 40 minute drive in and you can find parking for $17 a day in melbs.",

Of course it isn't the most luxurious caravan park ever but it does its little job. The uncovered site are just a little parking next to a strip of grass where you can put your tent and they ar enext to the bathroom (amazing). The bathrooms per se are clean and well maintained, they do miss soap.\nThe laundry is clean and works well. There isn't a camp kitchen.\nThe area is just an industrial area close to the airport but given that is next to the freeway in just 20 minutes you are un the city center with your little van. It's cheaper to drive and to use a paying parking lot than using public transport over there, the Mickey Mouse card in Melbourne is just an abomination.\nThe staff are extremely nice all around.\nOverall I suggest it if you just need a place to sleep and you want to spend your days in the city, it's cheap and maintained good.",

The facilities are basic, many are broken, old, but as far as I could see, clean. Hot showers, but no kitchen. Not really suited for campers, looks like a derelict motel/lodge for not yet homeless people. Still, rent is low for a place near Melbourne city, with a bus connection nearby. So probably, if I had the necessity to sleep in a camper in Melbourne again, I would still choose this place over the other overpriced campsites",

The campsite is very well maintained, the sanitary facilities are very clean and, above all, it's really cheap: $34 a night for 2A and 2C, 8-meter motorhome, power/water! There's also a laundry ($4 wash/$4 dry). Frankly, it's a great deal!",

Bitumen driveways and well kept grass areas. Camp kitchen with fridge, kettle, toaster, BBQ and super clean little oven with two hot plates on top. Two amenity blocks so no dramas when the cleaner is cleaning one of them. The normal cost is $34/night for a powered site. They kindly gave me a discount because I stayed for more than seven days even though it was over two separate periods. We stayed in Jan 2022. I would happily stay here again when next visiting Melbourne.",

The ensuite site was good but nothing supplied except dunny paper. No hand towels, no toiletries and even the shower mat was an outdoor rubber type. The slab we had wasn't great and when it rains the slab pools in two spots quite deep making the annex area unusable.\nThe two camp kitchens and amenities are first class, laundries were clean with modern machines and there's fire pits, games rooms a very good information centre and the staff couldn't have been nicer, everyone I had the opportunity to interact with was so nice.\nThe park is quite a ways from Lillydale township and shops not walking distance or even a bike ride as the park is on a single lane highway with no Bikeway or even a kerb to safely ride on. The BP next door was handy with some convenience items.\nHope this helps you decide to stay or not. I would go again just for the magnificent gardens and laser straight hedges. 😃",

The cabin air quality seems to be very dusty or have a lot of pollen as I cough non stop everytime we’re inside. Air quality seems to be cleaner and better outside than inside.\n\nAs stated the Cabin is suited for 8 people. They have heaps of knives and forks but MINIMAL plates and bowls, maybe around 3 plates, bowls and a few wide plates. Like seriously?!\n\nTowels and face towels all have stains, some with some black marks and some dirt on it which we end up not using. WiFi is non existent here, can find it but cannot connect to it. Can only connect when you’re outside.\n\nCoffee at the kiosk tastes horrible. Something that a kid would make, you have a fancy machine and grinder and yet you don’t know how to make a coffee.\n\nRec room is bare, air hockey has no puck after paying to play it. Pool table but no balls and sticks. Would thought they would have some activities for the kids to play with which we DON’T need to pay for since it’s a family park!\n\nManagement here is appalling, their first impression they seemed confused, I even gave them the cabin number we are staying at. And still got my name wrong after stating it the first time.\n\nFirst time staying at this resort and would be the last.",

          "reviewText": "For the past seven years, my niece and I have stayed at Crown Towers annually for 2–3 nights to celebrate our combined birthdays, always booking a Premier Room. Aside from consistently dirty windows, the experience has repeatedly been a genuine five-star stay.\n\nThis year, I stayed for three nights over Christmas with my cousin, booking a Studio Room. While the windows were spotless and the small walk in dressing room fantastic, everything else fell well short. Despite astronomical Christmas rates, my room (1025) was tired, dated, and clearly overdue for refurbishment.\n\nIssues included chipped furniture, stained upholstery, marked and dusty lampshades, mould in the shower, marked and dated power points, a missing desk lamp. The bathroom amenity box was heavily marked and scuffed, with visible stains and wear. The in-room amenities were abysmal. Toilet paper and tissues were thin and of poor quality.

          "reviewText": "For the past seven years, my niece and I have stayed at Crown Towers annually for 2–3 nights to celebrate our combined birthdays, always booking a Premier Room. Aside from consistently dirty windows, the experience has repeatedly been a genuine five-star stay.\n\nThis year, I stayed for three nights over Christmas with my cousin, booking a Studio Room. While the windows were spotless and the small walk in dressing room fantastic, everything else fell well short. Despite astronomical Christmas rates, my room (1025) was tired, dated, and clearly overdue for refurbishment.\n\nIssues included chipped furniture, stained upholstery, marked and dusty lampshades, mould in the shower, marked and dated power points, a missing desk lamp. The bathroom amenity box was heavily marked and scuffed, with visible stains and wear. The in-room amenities were abysmal. Toilet paper and tissues were thin and of poor quality. Opening the tea and coffee drawer felt more like a budget motel than a five-star hotel. Sparse condiments, no napkins, and poor presentation were completely unacceptable for a five-star hotel and particularly for the nightly rate charged.\n\nOverall, I was exceptionally disappointed.

This has become a much-loved annual Christmas tradition, and every year it somehow feels even more special.\nWe were thrilled to be upgraded to a Crystal Villa, and the room was nothing short of breathtaking. Beautifully designed, incredibly spacious, and finished to the highest standard, it felt like a true luxury retreat. The steam shower was a standout feature, and the sheer amount of space made the stay so comfortable and relaxing for our whole family.\nThe luxurious touches truly set the Crystal Villas apart — having a private elevator and private access directly through to the pool made the experience feel exclusive and incredibly special. Those details really elevate the stay and make you feel completely pampered.\nThe service in the Crystal Club was absolutely outstanding and deserves special mention. The team went above and beyond with thoughtful details and personal touches that made our children feel genuinely welcome and special, which meant so much to us as a family. That level of care and attentiveness truly sets Crown Towers apart and makes the experience unforgettable.\nA small thing to be aware of (mentioned only for clarity): while we had Crystal Club access, we had assumed all food and drinks were included. We were charged for some drinks during the high tea service — not a major issue at all, just something for future guests to be aware of.\nOverall, the room quality was exceptional, the service was flawless, and we were extremely happy with our stay. Crown Towers continues to exceed expectations, and this was another wonderful five-star experience for our family. We already can’t wait to return again next Christmas. ✨",

Adults only hours 8-10pm which is good but pool closes 10 so you pretty much need to skip dinner. Steam room only, no sauna, fits maybe 8 people.\n\nGym is nice if you plan to workout.\n\nRooms are dated, in deep need of a refresh, stains on carpets/couches, walls have been dented etc. drains were semi blocked, tiny toilet and water pressure too low to run shower and spa at the same time.\n\nRooms were pretty quiet tho so can’t complain and appeared quite clean.\n\nTv was small however okay channels and also was able to chromecast from phone.\n\nWas given low floor room despite putting high floor request on booking.\n\nBathtub is both short and narrow, if you’re over 1.8m, it’s tight. No slippers on arrival, had to call and ask.\n\nBell staff don’t direct valet traffic or open doors and get your bags, not sure what they are doing.\n\nI would not recommend the breakfast at conservatory, again very basic and kinda pricey",

I rang the managers and could only leave a message asking for them to return my call in case it was in the same condition the next morning. No return call was ever received! Secondly, they have the thinness toilet paper I have ever seen, as another reviewer said, it's disgusting (and false economy, work that one out for yourself).

I sometimes paddle down to Longridge and check it out and have a picnic.\nTHere are toilets and hot showers (solar) as well as a lovely simple, basic campground. You can access the park via Alexander Road which runs alongside the High School. You can book the site for group camping or for simple groups of up to 40 people. Only campers can come here.\nIt was nice to get up on a Sunday morning, drive into Warrandyte get a coffee, the paper and drive back for time in the deck chair on the Yarra River.\nYou can go fishing here as well but don't forget to get a licence.\nThere is a BBQ here which has wood provided by Parks ic. There is also an Information Shelter and tables. If you've got a canoe, there is now a canoe ramp.\nIf you'd like to book a site by calling Parks Vic on 131963 and you MUST book in advance, you can do this online. The time period between between 1:00pm on the 1st day and Noon on the following day constitutes consititutes a single day’s booking.\nThis place is quite disabled friendlly.\nHighly recommend.",

Housekeeping was alright for the first few days and then they totally slacked, not replacing towels and the wet floor mat by the bathroom. Since the bathroom (shower stall actually) didn't have a proper door, the floor and carpet by the sink was perpetually wet. Air conditioner in all 3 rooms were old and noisy. Hotel really needs a bit of work, and then it would be perfect.\n\nOn the plus side, the location is amazing. The lane behind the hotel has very good food (Mork Chocolate, a banh mi shop, a bagel shop, ... all good). Block Arcade across the road, Queen Vic Market and lots of malls nearby. The tram stops in front of the hotel and you can travel within the CBD for free.",

There were constant noises in the hallway and a bright strip of light under the door that made it hard to relax.

Free breakfast is also a bonus, it is until 11am too:) The staff was super, my reading lamp was broken at first and when I told about it they fixed it immediately!! Kitchen can get a bit crowded during lunch and dinner hours but that is understandable. Location is so good also! Shower ”shelf” was missing tho, would have been nice to put your stuff somewhere while taking a shower, but that is a tiny thing. I’d definitely recommend:)!",

My friends and I booked a three bed dorm and luckily got put on the 10 floor (one of the floors that had bathrooms since not all floors have one) & it put us one floor down from the cafe/rooftop. Rooms were clean. Bathrooms were clean - we actually saw the housekeepers cleaning them every morning and were amazed at how meticulous and efficient they are.\n\nI love the band system and I love that you needed the band to get in everywhere - bathrooms included. Felt extra secure and safe.\n\nCafe was cute and affordable. Such a lovely space and two of my friends were working remotely so it worked out really well for them.\n\nStaff were very friendly and the check in and check out process were smooth and easy. Great central location.\n\nThe only “negative” things I have to say are that the elevator took ages. Two elevators for 11 floors is a pain. The shower water pressure & temp were also kind of bad. The water will just change from hot to cold to warm to cold to hot and the water will cut out multiple times. The water pressure also messed with the toilets flushing as well - I’d have to stand there and hold down for a solid minute but anything would flush, even if it was one piece of tissue.",

No compensation, no apology.\n\nAnother problem: the laundry room was also unavailable, and guests were only notified on the same day. As for cleanliness, the room was not cleaned once in six days (no floor or shower cleaning), except for the trash being emptied daily.\n\nFor the price I paid, this is unacceptable.

Occasionally there’s pancake batter to cook yourself. Not terrible, but nothing special.\n\nThe real problem is the cleanliness—or rather, the lack of it. Mold and dust are everywhere, and the bathrooms are disgusting: hair, rubbish, even bodily fluids are common(after reflection I spared your eyes with the least disgusting one). Most of the time there’s no soap or toilet paper. And with only eight bathrooms for the whole hostel, it’s chaos.\n\nRooms barely get cleaned. Staff only change sheets and sometimes empty bins. Trash from previous guests stays under beds and on top of lockers. When I asked if it was possible to clean it, they told me I could do it myself.\n\nOn top of the filth, the hostel is extremely noisy. You can hear normal conversations from the street as if people are standing right next to your bed. On top of that, the doors slam constantly at all hours because their design makes them bang every time they open or close, making it impossible to get a decent night’s sleep.\n\nI’ve stayed in a lot of places, even in third-world countries, and this was by far the worst.

Best part is there is shade if you want it for summer. It has a few rubbish bins that were cleared during our 4 day stay. There are a few sets of table and chairs. It is a free space to stay for fully self contained vehicles. Public toilets are about 400m to the Service centre and can get a shower, truck stop style. Service stops also  has basic groceries like milk and bread. There is a burger joint fast food next door as well.",

Inside the interior of the pool features a water park designed for kids with a water slide, a nice and warm sauna designed for adults, two pools with different lanes (one approximately 5ft, the other approximately 2ft). The outdoor pool contains one single 5ft pool with lanes and an outdoor water play designed for kids (similar to the ones seen around sand at playgrounds). The gym features exercise equipment like rower machine, treadmill, weights, exercise bikes etc. I have been there to this pool many times over 15 years when it use to be YMCA and the old building, been to the new NARC since the launch opening in November 2023. The only reason why I've taken off one star is because there is not enough car spaces and can be frustrating to find one as the parking spaces are most of the time full, but the actual aquatic centre itself is 5 stars. Would highly recommend going there for swimming and exercising.",

The Northcote Aquatic & Recreation Centre might look great from the outside, but the ongoing maintenance issues tell a different story. The touchscreen shower system is constantly broken, the pool water is often not at the right temperature, and the main entrances — especially the ones used by parents with prams — are frequently out of order and left that way for weeks.\n\nThe biggest concern, though, is hygiene. There’s a carpet area between the indoor and outdoor pools that’s completely covered in mould. I’ve taken photos at different times, and it’s clearly not being cleaned or properly maintained. That’s really not acceptable in a community pool where kids and families are walking through all the time.\n\nManagement has been made aware of these issues several times, but nothing ever seems to change. The entrances stay broken, the showers don’t work, and the change rooms and toilets are often dirty.\n\nIt’s a real shame, because this could be a fantastic facility if it was properly looked after. Right now, though, it feels neglected and unhygienic — not what you’d expect from a newly built centre.",

          "reviewText": "Really disappointed with how this new facility is being managed. The Northcote Aquatic & Recreation Centre might look great from the outside, but the ongoing maintenance issues tell a different story. The touchscreen shower system is constantly broken, the pool water is often not at the right temperature, and the main entrances — especially the ones used by parents with prams — are frequently out of order and left that way for weeks.\n\nThe biggest concern, though, is hygiene. There’s a carpet area between the indoor and outdoor pools that’s completely covered in mould. I’ve taken photos at different times, and it’s clearly not being cleaned or properly maintained. That’s really not acceptable in a community pool where kids and families are walking through all the time.\n\nManagement has been made aware of these issues several times, but nothing ever seems to change. The entrances stay broken, the showers don’t work, and the change rooms and toilets are often dirty.\n\nIt’s a real shame, because this could be a fantastic facility if it was properly looked after. Right now, though, it feels neglected and unhygienic — not what you’d expect from a newly built centre.",

Every time I come to the gym no matter what day or time, it is overwhelmingly busy and I’m waiting to use machines for ages, it ends up being quite a frustrating session for me as everyone’s sitting on their phones not doing anything.

The water quality is excellent, and the surrounding area feels safe and comfortable. There are plenty of seating areas to rest, and the atmosphere is pleasant. The only small downside is that it can get a little crowded during peak times, which makes it less relaxing. Overall, it’s a fantastic pool to spend time at and definitely worth visiting. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",

The teachers were great, didn't have the best toddler bedside manner but they were ok, quite friendly. Changing facilities, always pretty ordinary, stock standard for a aquatic and leisure centre.\n\nLet's hope the next swim class is better as we didn't have the regular teacher who was meant to teach it.",

I went on Monday morning hoping to do some lap pool swimming. When I arrived the lap pools were laced with old men taking up all of the lanes, and going at a very slow speed (even in the “fast lane”) making it very hard to get any kind of exercise done without one of them bashing into my head. The changing rooms were outdated and had no privacy and it costs 2 dollars extra to “rent” a locker. I was shocked I wasn’t shown any of the facilities before paying. There was no communication when I arrived. Would only recommend for families, and old men, but if you’re 18-35, or have any athletic ability in the slightest, give it a skip.",

The toddler area is always closed due to either high or low chlorine issues. They said they would fix the pump by summer which isn't good enough. All the lanes are always fully booked due to swimming aerobics or swimming lessons. I was advised to use the crowded swimming pool which is 1.5m deep for my daughter who is only 2 years old. Not a safe option and wasn't gonna take the risk of having my daughter drown. Prices are never the same each time . Different workers will charge what they think , which is very unprofessional.

We were not disappointed with the treatments or the service.  From the initial telephone conversation to arrange an appointment to when we left You Day Spa after our treatments, we were greeted with genuine warmth, professionalism and friendliness.  Our experience was truly 5 star.  The spa is clean and the staff are friendly and professional.\n\nWe started with 60 minutes in the steam room which included a full body scrub. After a quick shower, we indulged in a phenomenal 90 minute body massage followed by a 60 minute facial.\n\nI could have stayed all day.  Next time!!.\n\nI can’t wait for our next visit.\nThank you",

We were not disappointed with the treatments or the service.  From the initial telephone conversation to arrange an appointment to when we left You Day Spa after our treatments, we were greeted with genuine warmth, professionalism and friendliness.  Our experience was truly 5 star.  The spa is clean and the staff are friendly and professional.\n\nWe started with 60 minutes in the steam room which included a full body scrub. After a quick shower, we indulged in a phenomenal 90 minute body massage followed by a 60 minute facial.\n\nI could have stayed all day.  Next time!!.\n\nI can’t wait for our next visit.\nThank you",

Why not schedule swim school during less busy times? Or if possible, since you're all pros, why not use the deeper pool instead of taking over the main one that most people use?\n\nAlso, the price for just a swim pass is too high!

The proper lap swimming area (the core part of pool) is greatly reduced, the water is also much shallower than before, no proper sitting area, tiny tiny change room, slow spraying shower with very tight timing. All these so called smart and environmentally friendly designs are sacrificing the basics of swimming—and if you don’t want to get cold by stay under waiting for shower, then go home with bleach smell and can’t do anything else before waste more water to clean yourself.",

Specially at noon or onwards, no one cares if dirty.\n3- Today steam room was closed, sometimes Spa and Suana were closed without any intimation. It’s maintenance should be arrange in off time.\n4- Use of antiseptic materials in pools water are high side which creates skin irritation afterwards.\nI will be grateful if you look into above suggestions to improve the facilities of the complex.

The instructors are kind and patient and the style of teaching is very gentle. The classes are small and it's a very relaxed environment. Cannot recommend this swimming school highly enough!",

It's generally not busy that you need to wait for machines. Amenities are amazing with wheelchair accessible bathrooms, showers, hair straighteners and hair dryers. The staff do an awesome job on top to make you feel at home with free deodorants, fruit, sanitisers and more. It's a typical small commercial gym with heart.",

A family friendly beach patrolled beach (seasonal) and lots of room to spread out on the sand especially low tide and grassed areas looking down on the water. Modern clean toilet shower facilities cafe and restaurant kids playground and life saving club for a cold ale at the end of your beach day. No dogs during peak season but there is one dog beach about 1km down the road for your furry mates. Rock pools to the left of the lifeboat ramp at low tide to explore for the kids. There is plenty of chances to boogie board or surf outside the flags depending on conditions but the more serious surfer maybe better at Raffs or 13th especially at peak times. There is a big free carpark but on those hot days it can be difficult to get one as it get very busy over the summer. Watch for Rips and swim between the flags when they are out and enjoy one of the best beaches in Victoria",

Location was great and the staff are friendly and helpful, but for us the beds are very uncomfortable, hard and no padding felt like springs were sticking into us. Cabins are showing a lot of wear and tear, eg fan switch nobs missing, doors have water damage, benches the laminate has chipped, fridge the shelves are broken. Outside, the towel rails brackets are not secure, the cabin wood needs painting, and the panels are lifting. Cleaning, showers need mould kill, particularly in the door, skirtings need dusting, windows need cleaning, walls and doors need wiping over. Grass needed mowing and many of the cabins had weeds in the garden beds. I think more maintenance and more time to do proper cleaning would benefit.

It is consistently such a great place for a family getaway.\n\n​The park is always impressively clean and the amenities are top notch. What really keeps us coming back is the range of children’s activities because there is so much to keep the kids entertained. It actually lets the parents relax for a bit.\n\n​The location is also a huge plus. It is tucked away enough to feel like a holiday but it is still super convenient for the essentials. Having Aldi, Coles, and Woolies all within a 10 minute drive makes grocery runs so easy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stress free family break on the Bellarine Peninsula.",

Loved the heated mineral pool and spa- best used early in the morning if you want to do laps. Only one half on the spa jets were working but they were excellent strength. Women's changeroom had very slippery floor tiles- not the best choice for a wet area and was small with  only one shower.. super close to the shore and we could hear the sounds of the ocean with our window open. Just don't open it wide enough for the cheeky cockies to enter as one got in and made a big mess all over the floor of our chips and pop corn! Worth noting, your car park may be un named as some are not designated to the rooms. Unimpressed with the in house breakfast buffet and the service in that area of the resort. Wouldn't bother again. Lovely sunrise from our room. Loved the cute ducks around the place.  Overall a very enjoyable stay.",

Overall, the place felt very tired and worn out — definitely in need of maintenance and a good clean. We were charged top dollar ($400 for one night) due to a basketball tournament in town, which made it feel like a real rip-off given the poor condition of the property.",

I booked in for a weekday facial and it was with the lovely Sophie who made me feel so cared for and my face was glowing afterwards, so I immediately feel in love and booked the same again, with Sophie. However my second visit recently was a very different experience, my appointment was not with Sophie as I had booked, and instead of being in a private room on a comfortable treatment bed I was put on a 'bed' with a plastic head rest that is used for the hair spa treatment. There was another client having a hair spa in the same room and as we were only separated by a curtain I felt like I was next to a shower room hearing the loud intermittent water. Trying to relax and enjoy my treatment was very hard hearing the hair spa next to me, being on a hard head rest, having water drip down my neck and back, and missing the elements of the facial that I experienced in the first appointment such as a soft pillow, and quiet room. I was so looking forward to my facial but didn't receive the same private experience I had hoped for. Not sure whether to try again because I honestly fell in love with Tohi first time but I'm unsure as to whether I will ever receive the same experience I had received initially 😞",

I was booked in for a 90min just breathe massage and my therapist was a lovely lady named Jo. She was so intuitive and her massage techniques were perfect. I asked for firm pressure and a focus on neck/shoulders, Jo relieved all my tension and didn’t rush at all. I’ve been to many many 5 star spas across Australia and all over the world but I can confidently say that this was the best massage. Every part of my body felt pampered, even my hands and feet were properly massaged and moisturiser was applied. There were hot towels and hot stones plus Jo even got a heat pack for my sore stomach. Just an absolutely incredible and thoughtful service. I can’t wait to come back!",

Has a kiosk with seating area for hot and cold food including coffee and hot chocolate.Has we check in codes and need to show vax status. Pricing is relatively cheap too. On a hot day this is a really nice place to be.",

All pool temperatures are pleasant, clean facilities, and lots of shade sales over the grass areas and bench seats, so plenty of space to spread out.

The room presentation was terrible and clearly not maintained. There were used cigarettes left inside the room, which is completely unacceptable. The towels were torn, and the bed sheets were stained, making the room feel very unhygienic and uncomfortable. This was one of the worst stays I’ve experienced, and I would not recommend this motel to anyone.",

We don't know the situation of the owners but they seemed to have relaxed on maintaining the caravan park. By allowing the weeds to take over, grass to grow wild and general untidiness it doesnt reflct the advertising pictures. We felt the ablution setup was poor, as there was only 4 toilets and 2 showers for the 30 sites. Most of which appeared to be permanents, which I don't have a problem with. If the owners are struggling then can't the residents pitch in and help???\nAnyway, I would leave it to others to decide whether they feel it's worthy of a longer stay, if we were to return it would only be for 1 night again.",

Good kids facilities with playground, pool and trampoline to burn energy after being in the car. Booking and check in service was great. Waterfront cabin whilst old and needs a fair bit of TLC, did have all amenities needed for our stay for a reasonable price. Views also beautiful of the lake. Would recommend for a one-two nighter in cabin or van site.",

Maybe consider creating a parking space that you charge $10/24hr fee for and make a new policy. Eventually you accepted $20 to allow us to fit the second car on the same site as the first one with swags. But this took three goes. You could have again just exercised some logic and said 'look usually we cannot accommodate this but as its winter and the park is empty we will do you a solid and let you park your car on one of the empty three sites next to you...\n\nHope some of the above improves as it is a lovely spot and would have returned mire regularly if it had been more pleasant overall",

But you might be able to access the castle to play on their equipment, just not as convenient if you need little people to buzz off for a few minutes as you need to accompany them.\nThe bathrooms are small but clean and quite new. They have powerpoints which was good as i brought my hair-dryer. The lights and fan are on a timer so they kept turning off while we showered but that wasn't too bad.\nThe camp kitchen is basic; fridge/freezer, microwave, single sink, stove and oven. Minimal bench space and small kitchen so i wouldn't want to try and use it at a busy time, you'd be waiting hours. We packed our own stove and small appliances, using only the sink late at night to do dishes when everyone was gone. There was also a bbq on the deck at the lichen too. No cutlery, a few utensils and no crockery for campers to use so bring what you need.\nIt was super quiet when we were there, but it seemed to be popular with caravans and campervans.\nThe staff were lovely, really helpful and assisted with a few booking issues we had.\nKryal castle on the door step made for a great day out and an easy walk to the tent.",

But you might be able to access the castle to play on their equipment, just not as convenient if you need little people to buzz off for a few minutes as you need to accompany them.\nThe bathrooms are small but clean and quite new. They have powerpoints which was good as i brought my hair-dryer. The lights and fan are on a timer so they kept turning off while we showered but that wasn't too bad.\nThe camp kitchen is basic; fridge/freezer, microwave, single sink, stove and oven. Minimal bench space and small kitchen so i wouldn't want to try and use it at a busy time, you'd be waiting hours. We packed our own stove and small appliances, using only the sink late at night to do dishes when everyone was gone. There was also a bbq on the deck at the lichen too. No cutlery, a few utensils and no crockery for campers to use so bring what you need.\nIt was super quiet when we were there, but it seemed to be popular with caravans and campervans.\nThe staff were lovely, really helpful and assisted with a few booking issues we had.\nKryal castle on the door step made for a great day out and an easy walk to the tent.",

As the heater is high on the wall I suspect a lot of heat went out through the ceiling .\nA big disappointment was there were No extra Blankets . We had to use bath towels and our coats on the bed to try to get warm .\nThere's also no hair-dryer in the bathroom !\nAll the above being said .\nThe staff are so pleasant, helpful and happy to chat about Castle and local places to visit.\nWe very much enjoyed the castle and all within  and in spring or summer will try to visit again, maybe bring family too.",

Instead they will BLAME you for not knowing what to expect in countryside and not asking for help at night time. Well, I would have called the after hours services if I was told that they could help me with catching flies but no I wasn't told anything about what to expect and how to deal with it when things happened. Usually accommodations in regional areas would tell us what to expect like there could be wildlife around and what to do but not for this place. They said they would have sprayed something in my room if I had called them but I had a baby with me. I dont know what makes them think this would be a good solution. Most staff are nice but the management sounds arrogant.\n\nPlus, the floor was greasy and sticky; windowsills were full of dust; we saw hair on a towel and bedsheet as well; the bathroom was freezing and none of us bothered to take a shower.\n\nAlso, dont book directly with them. It is better to book through a third party booking agent as they wouldnt get back to you when things happened even they said they would. At least the agent can help you follow things up. I had to try different channels to get someone calling me back!",

Activities conducted were adventurous and the staff (Tegan) conducting the activities was highly skilled and cooperative. Although we were not able to meet Grant or Christine (there is always a next time) but they were always in touch through emails or phone calls.\n\nThe only thing which we couldn't experience was the BonFire Pit as it was raining in the evening.\n\nHope to visit again in future !!!",

Our bathroom smelled moldy. The shower was backed up and overflowed. I guess that is why the bathroom smells moldy. The horrible shower curtain keeps blowing up against you while you shower. The people in the room above us seemed to be having some sort of jumping competition from 12:30 to 1am.\nIn the end I was happy to leave the room well before 10, no need to stay late here.\nIf the manager does not want to provide friendly service to customers, perhaps he should consider other lines of work.

Spacious room with study desk, small dining table, small kitchen and spacious bathroom with wide mirror, big shower space and toilet. It felt like we were staying at a serviced apartment. Inside the residence parking space also very safe for our car and close to room easy in and easy out. Shellie the manager is also very welcoming and helpful.

All the better in my mind, it was so nice having the pool to ourselves for more than half the session! The team was lovely and really made our visit a great experience.\n\nThe robes were so soft with a generous fitting (easily 4XL friendly). You're given flip flops, robe, and towel included in your entry. All you need to bring is your bathers.\n\nWe had an hour with the pool and sauna which felt like more than enough time. We practically floated out of the spa, so cozy and calm on a cold wet day. Highly recommend a visit!",

I told him I was a carer utterly exhausted and burnt out what do you suggest. He recommended a salt bath.  There are various options- massage, two types of saunas and a salt bath.  I had the salt bath recommended by Ray.  There was salt on the floor of inflorescent red light, a box of tissues and a relaxing wellness light.  There was soft music. Nothing said on way in nothing to do but relax or face the ‘demons’ in you.  I slowly began with a mindful relaxation and felt salt in my skin but it was healing my spirit.  Washing away negative thoughts, anger, annoyances with family. Etc. in the end I pictured all who were causing me pain and not helping me in my role as carer.  I gently, peacefully it\nimagined what I would like to say to them and I was no longer hurt or angry or whatever. The salt bath had healed me - body, mind and spirit. A big thank you to Ray and the staff and I highly recommend it.",

Other than that it's a fantastic park. Ensuite sites are very practical and modern facilities. Family room in the main amenities that had a bath which was great for our youngest. The play centre is a fantastic addition and a great way to wear the kids out! A very family friendly park. It is close to a main road however the road noise wasn't really noticeable at night.

Also beware the floor on my shower was a little slippery.  There was no noise issues so slept quite well.\n\nBut it is a fair way away from anywhere to eat or go for a glass of wine so you will have to hop in your car (or taxi/uber) or just use the onsite bistro and bar. Same if you want to go to the main part of Bendigo and the traffic is quite heavy. There is a Sportsbar/gaming/bistro onsite with some good food and nightly special prices (Happy Hour is a good time to grab that beer). There was however nowhere to sit and have a glass of wine or beer or whatever you fancy other than the Sportsbar, which I was a little surprised about.",

Also beware the floor on my shower was a little slippery.  There was no noise issues so slept quite well.\n\nBut it is a fair way away from anywhere to eat or go for a glass of wine so you will have to hop in your car (or taxi/uber) or just use the onsite bistro and bar. Same if you want to go to the main part of Bendigo and the traffic is quite heavy. There is a Sportsbar/gaming/bistro onsite with some good food and nightly special prices (Happy Hour is a good time to grab that beer). There was however nowhere to sit and have a glass of wine or beer or whatever you fancy other than the Sportsbar, which I was a little surprised about.",

Instant hot water and lots of it. I ate in the restaurant on Monday evening and the food was excellent. Your gym, sauna and pool were a welcome bonus.\n\nThank you it makes business travel so much better when you have something nice to come back to after a long day.",

The facilities are amazing, there was activities for the kids, a live performance on the Saturday evening on the beautiful grassy area which was complete with fresh pizzas available to order and an ice cream truck! The playground looked a bit dated but the kids absolutely loved it! The pool looks small when passing by but is absolutely great and surprisingly spacious! The shower block consists of multiple little ensuites with enough room that I could shower my two daughters and myself one after another without being crammed.\nThe kids loved seeing the animals everyday in the petting zoo area, not to mention the cute little chickens at the back of the shop! The jumping pillow was also a huge hit!\nEverything down to the bbq area being freshly stocked every morning with enough dish soap and a few freshly washed and dried chux cloths and tea towels just made the stay even more perfect! And just when you think you may have forgotten something just pop into the little shop to grab literally anything except the kitchen sink!! From nappies to batteries to hydralyte, first aid kits, salt and pepper, water and fishing rods the convenience of the little shop absolutely blew my mind! A little pricey but you’re paying for the convenience which is well worth it! And considering how lovely the service is who cares if you’re paying a tiny bit more than usual for an item you need!\nWe absolutely loved this place and next time will bring the kids bikes for the little bike track!\n\nThank you to your entire team for such a great weekend!!",

Lots of green tables with benches to sit and have a bite to eat. Huge undercover area with more tables and benches to sit and eat when it's raining. Behind the undercover area is a lake half empty tho but not good to go in for a swim as the water is murky. Lots of fire pits to cook food and 2 drop toilets if you need to go.. No showers or rubbish bins but otherwise a quiet spot. Foxes are cunning tho and do come near the fire pits so obviously people have been feeding them for them to come close to where you stay.",

Lovely quiet spot for swimming in the river near the bridge.  Never got the kayak in a it was a tad windy, next time. Plenty of wood on the ground for a small cooking fire.\nShame about all the toilet paper along the water side, move away people, at least 100 paces, and do the right thing.",

The check-in process was seamless, thanks to the instant message service\nWe received extremely fast responses with their initial availability , clear instructions on everything I enquired about , and on arrival, had our site sorted with zero fuss. It couldn’t have been easier.\n\nA big thank you to Jamie and Damien, who were both exceptionally friendly and helpful. Damien  greeted us with a smile, provided personal guidance right to our drive-through site, and ensured we were fully set up without any hassle.\n\nWe chose a drive-through site near the amenities, and it was perfect. The site was sealed, with a tidy grassed area, a nearby seat, and the amenities block just across the road. The amenities themselves were outstanding , extremely spotless, and very comfortable to use. We were so impressed, we booked an extra night just to get our washing done using the great laundry area, complete with two full clotheslines right  nearby\n\nThe park is immaculate, beautifully laid out with large powered sites ( some overlooking the town ) with very modern units also available , and as a whole was clearly well maintained. The camp kitchen was immaculately clean and well-positioned for easy access by all guests. It made preparing meals a breeze.\n\nAnother huge plus: it’s only a 5-minute walk to the Main Street, where we found everything we needed—great shops, a well-kept town park, and even a visit to the lovely local hairdresser, Melinda, who gave us fantastic haircuts during our stay.\nThe local street art around the town was so good and the silo art is a must see , all located around the town streets .\n\nOur time at St Arnaud Caravan Park was simply incredible. Between the friendly hosts, clean facilities, and charming town, it’s a place we’d happily return to and highly recommend to anyone travelling through this beautiful part of Victoria.\n\nA true hidden gem !\nA huge congratulations to the owners\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ s from me",

Plenty of towels and a specific make up towel! For those that have stayed in enough cabins... you know these are a real treat!

Owners Terri, Dirk and doggy Beauie are so friendly. welcoming, accommodating and chilled! Doggies even have a fully fenced area they can play in, when their cute chickens aren't foraging.

The room smells beautifully fresh and is absolutely sparkling clean – truly impressive. I love the comfortable bed adorned with beautiful, clean white sheets and doona cover. A particularly nice touch is finding a hair dryer in the equally spotless bathroom – something you don't always get! The gentleman at the front desk is  very friendly and welcoming. This motel came highly recommended by a friend, and they were spot on – the rooms are beautiful. The added bonus of YouTube for entertainment is much appreciated. For anyone visiting Bendigo, this is the place to stay: very reasonably priced, immaculately clean, and beautifully presented. Ten stars if I could!",

          "reviewText": "Absolutely Delighted - Highly Recommend!\nWhat a fantastic surprise from the moment I opened the door. The room smells beautifully fresh and is absolutely sparkling clean – truly impressive. I love the comfortable bed adorned with beautiful, clean white sheets and doona cover. A particularly nice touch is finding a hair dryer in the equally spotless bathroom – something you don't always get! The gentleman at the front desk is  very friendly and welcoming. This motel came highly recommended by a friend, and they were spot on – the rooms are beautiful. The added bonus of YouTube for entertainment is much appreciated. For anyone visiting Bendigo, this is the place to stay: very reasonably priced, immaculately clean, and beautifully presented. Ten stars if I could!",

So there was no screaming or annoying sounds.\nWe will definitely be staying again, and next time, I hope to use the pool there.",

You will experience shade trees, lawn areas, seating, native plantings and landscaping.

Face pillow is comfortable! (I struggle to find good one of these). I've had 3 different Masseuses now and pressure has been exactly what was asked for (They even walked/knelt on my back!!). Great at finding sore spots, keep hands on and go at a good pace. Warm/hot towels are used at the end (and not just one for the whole body so it's cold after the first area!). They made me feel comfortable enough to voice my needs. Pricing is good, opening hours and availability work. They give you water at the end and mints are available. They have loyalty cards.\nThey certainly earn the 5 star rating.",

The facilities and the service both fell well below the standard you would expect from a gym at this price point.\n\nTo start with, the cleanliness of the pool area and male changing rooms is unacceptable. The pool has repeatedly appeared unclean, and the changing room almost always has a strong, unpleasant smell. On several occasions I noticed dead flies left in the lockers, which is clearly a sign that basic cleaning and hygiene standards aren’t being met.\n\nWe then experienced problems with our access cards being locked without any explanation. My partner entered with their card, held the door for me, and I tapped myself in as well. Apparently this isn’t allowed, something to do with a strict “one person at a time through the door after it closes” policy. Yet none of this was ever communicated to us during sign-up or induction. We only found out after emailing management, who informed us of the rule after the fact. Even after that, the access for one of us still didn’t work properly, leaving us stuck in a loop of back-and-forth with no resolution.\n\nThe attitude and experience level of the front desk staff also left a lot to be desired. Each time we tried to get help in person, the staff seemed unsure of procedures, unable to fix issues, and generally not very helpful. There’s a noticeable lack of training or support for them, which unfortunately spills onto customers.\n\nFinally, and most frustratingly, we followed the official cancellation procedure through their online portal over a week ago, visited the gym in person to follow up, and emailed both the main inbox and the manager. We’ve had no response whatsoever. For a gym that stresses policies and procedures so heavily, they don’t seem able to follow their own when it comes to processing cancellations.\n\nOverall, this has been one of the poorest gym experiences I’ve ever had. Unclean facilities, inconsistent access, unhelpful staff, and a complete lack of communication from management. I’m still waiting for confirmation of my cancellation, and at this point I’m extremely unimpressed. I hope they take this feedback seriously and improve things for future members.",

Consequently I feel very confident in their tuition. Not only that, and perhaps more importantly, the kids look forward to their lessons and love going. Highly recommended.",

The reverse cycle struggled to heat the room and needed to extra blanket. Stand out was the staff, they are super helpful. Thankyou :)",

Super friendly, always happy to help, join in activities and just generally good vibe. Shoutout to Pepe and Luke!\n2. It’s a party/social hostel which makes it very easy to make friends and socialise. But beware that 90% of people coming here are British so if you’re from the UK and want to stay away from Brits, tough luck 😂 otherwise the activities are super fun, there is something on every day and the alcohol is MUCH cheaper than going out (especially if you catch happy hour)\n2.1. Free breakfast, fresh pancakes are dope! Maybe not every day, but when you really can’t be asked with cooking and just want something for the hangover, pancakes are a lifesaver!\n3. The app!!! They use an app (called Goki) and if you stay here, you can basically get through all the doors without having to carry an annoying wristband or card that is easy to leave behind. I’d recommend memorising the codes anyways, but saves you time with punching in the codes if you just use the app\n\nNow the cons:\n1. As I said, it’s a party hostel. I wouldn’t recommend staying for longer than a week unless you’re into that much partying (to each their own). But after 7 days you’ve seen all the socials, and you can always come back and join in even if you stay in a different hostel. Be prepared for people to come in at all hours of the night, usually drunk, or with someone else, so an eye mask and very good ear plugs/noise cancelling headphones are recommended\n2. Which is not really a big issue but found it quite strange - during the events there is sometimes a queue outside and even if you live here you have to queue or ‘prove’ that you live in the hostel and argue with the bouncers (who are not the friendliest I found, especially late at night)\n3. And this is the biggest issue - the facilities!!!\nThe rooms are just terrible, and I’m not talking about the cleanliness, it’s how they’re set up. I stayed in a 6 bed room and these were double beds that have no curtains (therefore 0 privacy), no shelves or plugs on the top bunks (so if and when your alarm goes off you have to jump off the bed before it wakes everyone else up) and the whole bed is extremely flimsy, basically ready to fall apart. The structural integrity of the beds is very questionable, I stayed in the top bunk and every time I climbed on the stairs I felt this is the moment the bed falls over.\n\nThe showers are not much better either, very outdated, water going everywhere and if anyone wants to use it after you they basically have to swim in. There is also only one shower/toilet per room so if you’re in a bigger room and don’t get in first, tough luck.\n\nAnd the lockers are tiny and look like they are from WW2. These are hostels for backpackers but you will really be able to put only your valueables and few other things in there. And be prepared the the metallic clinging will wake everyone up whenever you open/close them.\n\nFinally the kitchen is just run down. Very outdated, you can see everything has been used for years and hasn’t been replaced and can fit max 8 people at once in there.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the rooms were cleaned every day as well as the common rooms, they just feel very outdated compared to other hostels that charge similar prices.\n\nAt the end with Nomads you pay for the social events and the premium location at St Kilda, and you get amazing staff who will accommodate you, and if that’s what you’re looking for, this is the place for you! 😊",

We’re in our early thirties now so maybe we’re less tolerant of the inconveniences that come with staying at places like these. For example, the kitchen gets very busy, and again there was no room to store our groceries properly (fridge or non-fridge)—everything had to be stuffed in.\n\nThere is a bathroom (toilet and shower) in every room. Good at first. But of course, at 2am a roommate decided to take (no joke) half an hour to take a shower. There’s no other toilets accessible in the building except on the rooftop floor, closed at night. If there was just one available for cases like this, that would be good, but tricky to implement.\n\nA much easier fix I’d recommend to management is to clearly list accessibility information on the website and provide a seat or two at reception. My partner injured her knees and struggled to use stairs or stand for long periods of time. These small things would have made the world of difference in our case.",

The lockers in the rooms are far too small, so it’s impossible to store all your belongings properly. We placed some of our things neatly in bags on the side of the room, but the staff pushed them under the beds in a careless way, even with their feet. That felt very disrespectful. The kitchen is small, constantly crowded, and often dirty. On top of that, we had a balcony attached to our room but weren’t even allowed to use it, which was extremely disappointing.\n\nStill, I want to mention that the reception staff were genuinely friendly and always tried to help whenever they could. The social vibe is great if you want to meet other travelers, and the common events in the evenings were fun and well-organized. With a few improvements, this hostel could actually become a much better place to stay.",

Cocktails, good cider on tap, and raffles, what more do you want?!\nSecure entry and exit at the main door is good esp considering location.\nLove that they've kept a lot of the original building architecture design. I don't understand why people complain that there isn't a lift for a two storey building! Or, why they'd expect there to be.\nThe clean, fresh, and tidy double room was ideal. Tiny shared bathroom with one toilet and shower - all clean! Cos it's very small, more hooks would be useful for changing clothes and toiletries because there aren't any surfaces to put your stuff down.  Downstairs G floor unisex shared shower pretty pitiful. Showerhead leaks - probably just needs a new washer or shower head? Floppy shower head which don't help. Nowhere dry to put your stuff as flow pooled with water, one tiny hook on the back of the door, and a cold tap handle which comes off every time you touch it - so watch out for yer feet. Overall a bit minging. Dorm beds good, clean, light and power cables in each bunk -and a like light curtain across each bed which makes a difference from everyone putting up towels for privacy years ago :D\n\nBarista on-site pours great coffee and has good chat.\nBar closes at 11pm which is fine but would be useful to know when you check-in.\nDidn't see any kitchen or similar room for water, making tea or a snack which is something I've always used at a backpackers. Fortunately I had an esky & ice with my backpack because I'd been camping, usually I put my chilled stuff in a fridge in a communal kitchen when travelling.\nThe only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 stars for the room is because the price changes dramatically, sometimes over $100 for a small double room to nearly $200. Pretty unexpected for a backpackers imho.   The same with dorm bed prices changing and not being static - why would a backpacker want or expect to spend up to $79 on a single bed in a shared room? The changeable and sometimes really high pricing takes away the inherent freedom of traditional backpacking for me.\nDoing a different type of trip where I might plan a couple of days here or there interstate and want a budget motel on the road, I can expect $100ish+ for an Aussie motel room with private bathroom; For a city suburb like across metro Melbourne perhaps a night at a Quest incl Queen bed and private bathroom is getting closer to $160-200 (and above, the nicer you go) and although those prices fluctuate they don't change by 50-100% like they do at Roamer, and they're not a hostel/backpackers.\nFor a backpackers in a major city, (and having backpacked on and off for 20 years) I think charging anything like $100-199 per night for a small room and tiny shared bathroom is unreal, let alone suggesting $60-80 to share a dorm per night!  That said, Roamer is friendly, KIND  (which is something you really appreciate when travelling), it's clean, bright, cool interior design, great location, so if you get a good price it's an unmissable place to stay. Larger backpackers are also friendly, but Roamer St Kilda has something special.",

The staff? Absolute legends. No robotic greetings or forced smiles – just genuine warmth, quick wit, and a level of care you can’t fake. Whether it was helping me plan my day, sharing a beer and a laugh in the common area, or remembering my name and story after one conversation – these people get it.\n\nThe place is spotless, effortlessly cool, and buzzing with the kind of energy that brings people together. Beds are comfy, showers are hot, and there’s an unspoken magic that happens when backpackers and locals share stories under fairy lights until the early hours. Community doesn’t just happen here – it’s cultivated.\n\nForget overpriced room service and gold-plated nonsense – this hostel offers something no five-star hotel can: soul.\n\nStay here once and you’ll understand. You won’t just leave with memories – you’ll leave with family.",

          "reviewText": "“A Masterclass in Hospitality – A Hidden Gem That Puts Luxury Hotels to Shame”\n\nIf the Ritz is the high-gloss cover of a magazine, this hostel is the heartfelt, handwritten letter tucked inside – raw, real, and unforgettable.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I felt like I'd arrived home. The staff? Absolute legends. No robotic greetings or forced smiles – just genuine warmth, quick wit, and a level of care you can’t fake. Whether it was helping me plan my day, sharing a beer and a laugh in the common area, or remembering my name and story after one conversation – these people get it.\n\nThe place is spotless, effortlessly cool, and buzzing with the kind of energy that brings people together. Beds are comfy, showers are hot, and there’s an unspoken magic that happens when backpackers and locals share stories under fairy lights until the early hours. Community doesn’t just happen here – it’s cultivated.\n\nForget overpriced room service and gold-plated nonsense – this hostel offers something no five-star hotel can: soul.\n\nStay here once and you’ll understand. You won’t just leave with memories – you’ll leave with family.",

I failed to get an entire workout in the whole time I was there because I didn’t fancy waiting an extra 30 mins to be able to get my lifts in. I also have a problem with the culture there - I rarely saw anyone wipe down equipment after use and barely anyone used a towel.  I thought it was maybe just a Melbourne thing but I have since moved to another gym and it is no where near as busy, they have a no towel no train policy and everyone wipes down equipment!\n\nThe staff are lovely, but I think the gym has massive issues as a whole - and have now been slapped with a 245 dollar cancellation fee.

I suggest coming here only for cardio and other machines 3/5\n\nAgain because of the size of the gym, with just 5 people in it, it felt crowded to me. Clean floor though.

It is very very humid inside making it difficult to exercise. I'm not sure whether it's the aircon settings or just the humidity from the 3 showers 1/5\n\nTo me the music sounded too loud. These days people either come to the gym to socialise, exercise quietly with no noise or music, or exercise with their headphones on. I had to turn the volume in my headphones higher than usual. 3/5\n\nI visited after hours so can't comment on the team and the vibe here",

Everything that you're looking for in a local, well maintained swimming pool. Only the hydro pool offers wheelchair accessibility (via portable hoist), which is unfortunate (but better than nothing). Group exercise classes are also available.\n\nI'm sad to say though that despite the good array of swimming and wellness facilities offered by this complex, the customer service is absolutely appalling. If you're unlucky enough to be overcharged by one of the ever-rotating casual junior staff members at the front desk who frequently make mistakes at your expense, or if you can't get into an Aqua Fun/Fit class because they've been overbooked (which you have paid extra for in advance, mind you) - good luck getting any help. It's not possible to actually get your money back via refund (Oasis policy - yes, really), and although the promise of swim credits apparently exists for overcharges, they're harder to get your hands on than a rainbow coloured unicorn farting coffee scented fairy dust.\n\nThe junior cashiers (who are the only point of call at the pool if you run into a problem) will generally lead you down a maze of misinformation, until one of them will eventually advise you to get in touch with the elusive customer service manager, Simone, via email. You follow this advice, and if you're lucky, Simone might respond to your email within 2-3 weeks (or maybe not at all, if she doesn't feel that way inclined), to let you know that she won't help you. If you then decide to go back to the pool to speak to Simone face-to-face about your problem, the junior at the cash register will first pretend to not know who Simone is, and after eventually kindly remembering, will not be able to tell you whether she is in the building or not. They will also not be able to check if she is present or not. You will most unfortunately be directed back to your computer, and asked to send her an email (which may or may not be responded to).\n\nIt sounds comical and somewhat exaggerated, but I'm sorry to say that it's not. It's a great little pool as far as infrastructure goes, but heaven help you if you need assistance in any way, from anyone. Know your prices before going in there, because the staff don't.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year.",

The water quality is average, cleanliness could be better but still acceptable.\nI usually come here to swim on weekdays around midday and always have a lane to myself. Except for summer months when it’s really crowded.\nThe change room is spacious with enough cubicles. The water pressure in the shower is an issue along with hot water. If you let the water to stop running you’ll have to start again with cold water. Cleanliness in the change rooms could use some attention, especially the hair all over the floor. Maybe if there were bins in the change room, possibly where people dry their hair, and not only on the corridor, this could be resolved.\nOverall the pool is still a lot better than many others in the southern suburbs.",

Their love for their work shines through in everything they do — from teaching to customer service. You can tell they treat every child and parent like family, and that makes all the difference.\n\nI want to personally thank a few standout staff members who have made our experience so special:\n\n💦 Isabelle – A truly kind and passionate instructor. She goes above and beyond every week, clearly explaining progress and celebrating achievements. Her communication and care give parents so much confidence.\n\n💦 Bec – The all-round superstar! Whether she’s on pool deck, at reception, or helping with customer service, she’s always smiling, professional, and knowledgeable. You can count on her for anything.\n\n💦 Tey – My son’s first swimming teacher and an absolute gem. Tey’s professional, calm, and goal-focused approach helped my son progress quickly and enjoy every lesson.\n\n💦 Kat – Always full of energy and confidence, Kat is fantastic at customer service and never hesitates to help. She’s professional, approachable, and consistently goes the extra mile.\n\nTo the whole Splash team, thank you for creating such a positive, family-friendly, and motivating environment. You’ve truly made a lasting impact on my son’s growth — both in the water and in life. The facilities are great and so is the atmosphere\n\nHighly recommend Splash Dandenong to any parent who wants their child to thrive, not just swim. 🏊‍♂️💙",

He took the time to ask about any problem areas and adjusted pressure throughout to ensure I was comfortable. His technique was both intuitive and skilled, melting away the knots in my shoulders and lower back without ever feeling rushed.\n\nThe treatment room was spotless, cozy, and thoughtfully designed with dim lighting, heated tables, and soft linens. I particularly appreciated the little touches—a warm towel under my neck at the end and herbal tea offered after the session.\n\nPrices were reasonable for the quality, I left feeling lighter, more relaxed, and mentally recharged.\n\nIf you’re looking for a true sanctuary to unwind and reset, Holism is a must-visit. I’ll definitely be returning and trying more of the experiences and treatments this spa has to offer.\nHighly recommend!",

          "reviewText": "We stayed at Yarra lodge and my husband played golf at the heritage. I thought the spa would be a similar standard of service because it was recommended on their website and I was completely wrong.\nI emailed them two weeks prior, explaining I was 30 weeks pregnant and wondering if there were any treatments I could have, like a facial, where I didn’t need to lie down on my back as I couldn’t because I was pregnant, so I thought I was quite clear and specific.\nThey responded saying yes and that their facials were safe for pregnancy. So I was reassured and booked a facial for me and a massage for my husband. (They’re not cheap either and I was so close to booking their more expensive packages, thank god I didn’t)\nThey charge extra for the “facilities” and they’re just not worth it (a pool, small gym and cold sauna), zero customer service as soon as we arrived. Usually when you go to a spa they explain what will happen, where you will go, give you a towel if you’re using the pool or sauna etc before, but we had to ask the man at reception for everything and it seemed like an effort and as if it wasn’t something that was usually provided.

          "reviewText": "We stayed at Yarra lodge and my husband played golf at the heritage. I thought the spa would be a similar standard of service because it was recommended on their website and I was completely wrong.\nI emailed them two weeks prior, explaining I was 30 weeks pregnant and wondering if there were any treatments I could have, like a facial, where I didn’t need to lie down on my back as I couldn’t because I was pregnant, so I thought I was quite clear and specific.\nThey responded saying yes and that their facials were safe for pregnancy. So I was reassured and booked a facial for me and a massage for my husband. (They’re not cheap either and I was so close to booking their more expensive packages, thank god I didn’t)\nThey charge extra for the “facilities” and they’re just not worth it (a pool, small gym and cold sauna), zero customer service as soon as we arrived. Usually when you go to a spa they explain what will happen, where you will go, give you a towel if you’re using the pool or sauna etc before, but we had to ask the man at reception for everything and it seemed like an effort and as if it wasn’t something that was usually provided. Their showers etc need a refresh too.

Big shout out to my son's swiming instructor for showing kindness and patience with teaching my son the necessary skills in his swimming lessons with you every week. The sessions has truly become a highlight of my son’s Monday’s after school. We’ll definitely continue with his lessons in the future until he is fully capable of swimming independently. Thank you,\nPelican.",

The message bathtub was a pleasant surprise and added a nice touch of relaxation. It’s also worth noting that there’s a Pokey outlet within the hotel, which may appeal to some guests looking for entertainment options on-site.\n\nThere were a number of issues that took away from the overall experience. A strong sewage smell in the bathroom was difficult to ignore, and one of the tap levers was missing. We also found a bathroom accessory that had already been opened, which was concerning from a hygiene perspective. The wardrobe was missing a hanger, and a faulty light switch with poor contact made it inconvenient to use. Additionally, the corridor leading to the rooms had a strong smell of cigarette smoke, which lingered and affected the overall comfort. Addressing these issues would significantly improve the quality of the stay.",

A 10:00 PM closing time should be the bare minimum. Other places understand this and accommodate their members—why can’t Brooklands? There’s nothing relaxing about rushing to squeeze in a quick swim before getting kicked out. And don’t even get me started on how crowded it gets during that tiny window of availability. It’s frustrating, unfair, and honestly, lazy planning.\n\nIt’s a shame because the rest of the facility isn’t bad. The gym is decent, the staff are nice, and the building is well-kept. But the pool issue completely overshadows the positives for me. I didn’t sign up to be on someone else’s schedule—I signed up to use the amenities I’m paying for.\n\nUnless the pool hours are extended to something reasonable like 10 PM, I’ll be taking my business elsewhere—and I know I’m not the only one feeling this way.",

I was about to go and ask to pay the extra for an ensuite when I saw a few sites were empty but checked out the amenities and knew there was no need. Lovely toilets and fab hot powerful showers - rainfall shower head! Loads of hooks and space to put your stuff in the shower too. All nice and clean. Tiny toilets by our site which was nice to have something so close. We didn’t use the camp kitchen but it was fully functional with oven and air fryer! Only a 7 minute drive to the front and they do an offer with a brunch place too. Would recommend.",

The kitchen is well-equipped; although the oven is a bit dated, we were still able to cook our dinner without any issues. This quiet and pleasant location offers reliable water supply and electricity at a reasonable rate. I would definitely recommend this park to others visiting Mornington.",

Not overbearing but definitely noticable.\n\nWe were provided with 2 towels for 4 guests, one towel with a bloodstain on it. When I took the blood stained towel back to reception to ask for another one and for some additional towels for the other guests, the caretaker told me she had been washing some and kept \"forgetting\" to bring them across to us and would do that shortly. Over 1.5 hours later and still no towels. I called them up and again asked for fresh towels; eventually brought across over half an hour later, with a simple \"here you go\", no apology or acknowledgement whatsoever. One would think that if you have already inconvenienced your guests by losing their booking and then making them wait until you get it ready, you would try and redeem yourself by \"remembering\" to get them settled in and bring them some towels and would apologise for the inconveinienes.  At the very least.\n\nOur frustrations only grew when we went to have a shower that night and realised there was no soap to use.\n\nAlso no milk supplied for the coffee and tea.\n\nWe are reasonable people. The lost record of our booking was likely human error and we all know mistakes happen. We would have easily put it down to a mistake and moved on, but when you consider being charged $230 a night and getting woeful customer service, dirty linen and lack of basics like soap and milk, I'm sure you can see why we're not impressed!\n\nPerhaps the caretakers don't often receive guest holiday bookings so things get a bit chaotic for them when they do (looked to be quite a lot of permanent residences around the park - maybe they make up the majority).  Maybe the business has recently changed hands and is being run by new owners who are still finding their feet. Or maybe they actually just don't give a crap about their guests, which is definitely how it seemed to us.\n\nThe positives are that the accomodation is located in a nice quiet spot close to the beach and a short drive to Balnarring. Cabin was stocked with cutlery and plates,  had a ceiling fan in the main bedroom and split system in the living area - temperature was comfortable.",

You never saw any thing close to that where I used to live. Definitely worth the extra time to get here as right on the beach , clean park , kind residents and as I said management make sure you are welcomed.

Shop opens til late so you can always book in if you don't get the km under your belt bet you intended to drive that day and I could not knock the place in any possible a very nice clean Park big swimming pool and great management 💯",

The campground is very close to Rosebud's shops, walking distance. All the campgrounds down the peninsula have one disadvantage in common: they are all between the sea and the street. Even if your site is close to the sea, you will still hear the cars. But, at night, there are lesser cars. And: all the birds are pretty noisy too! I wished they had some unpowered tent sits closer to the sea, and not all right next to the street. If shops in walking distance doesn't matter for you, check out the campgrounds further down the peninsula, they seem to be a bit more in a natural environment and some have direkt sea view.

The bike riding paths are fantastic\n\nThe Rangers make sure everything is right and are very responsive to any concerns.\n\nYou obviously hear road noise but it’s not overwhelming and security ensure there is no loud noise after 11pm.\n\nThen of course you have one of the safest beaches on the Peninsula. See you next year Capel Sound.",

Always a brilliant experience, food is delicious and cabins are neat, spacious and have great amenities. Plenty of options for adventure, beach or relaxing activities - take your pick! Staff make you feel welcome, no question is too silly and they are all extremely supportive of everyone, especially when trying to overcome some nerves trying out new activities for the first time. Highly recommend to all.",

          "reviewText": "I visited Bay Park Scout Camp in April 2024 when Melbourne Survivor booked it out to film the fifth season of their YouTube series. We had the camp from Friday through to Sunday, using the space to set up and film the game. Across the weekend, we had around 25–30 people coming and going to help organise everything, with most of our crew staying on site.\n\nThe accommodation included four rooms of bunk beds, with about four bunks per room (sleeping up to eight). The beds were typically hard, as you’d expect at camp, but we brought our own bedding to make them more comfortable as no bedding is provided just a mattress. The toilet and shower block at the end of the main building had lacklustre water pressure but at least stayed hot for quite a while.\n\nThe kitchen was a real highlight, large and well stocked with crockery, perfect for catering events or cooking up a feast. We catered for ourselves and stocked up supplies from the Woolworths just 15 minutes down the road. Adjoining the kitchen is a spacious mess hall with lino flooring, plus a large carpeted room we used for challenge equipment and a smaller office we turned into a data room to process footage. This setup worked brilliantly for us, especially with the multiple entrances and exits that helped with all the player and crew movements for the game. There’s also a cute courtyard at the front of the main building which was a lovely spot to hang out.\n\nThe lake next to the main building was great for water based challenges, although the water was quite murky (as you’d expect) and probably not the best for swimming. There’s so much to do on site, including an archery range, volleyball court, go-kart track, large stage, oval, and plenty of other areas that we made use of for challenges. The old machinery (including an old train) added a really cool vibe to the space. Each tribe was also able to light their own fires at designated fire pits and cook rice and lentils, just like in the show.\n\nThe owners and staff were lovely and accessible during the day at the small house near the entry. They keep the site in good condition, with plenty of activities available. Although the camp is mostly used by Scouts, it can be hired out when not in use. Being in Mount Martha, it’s a bit of a trek from Melbourne, but it’s a great spot to escape the city for a camp style weekend. The nearby town of Mount Martha is handy too, so you’re not far from civilisation if you need anything.\n\nI really enjoyed filming here and loved the location, it truly helped us bring the game to life, and I can’t wait to see how it all comes together on the Melbourne Survivor YouTube channel. While a few areas of the main building could do with a bit of love and some upgrades, overall, the space was fantastic. I’d definitely recommend Bay Park Scout Camp to anyone looking to run outdoor activities with large groups, it’s a great place to book, and I hope more people take the chance to get out of the city and have a fun time at Mount Martha.",

We found grime in the sink and shower, and there isn’t even a space for the toilet paper; it just sits on top of the toilet itself. Windows filthy, spiderwebs everywhere, cold rooms. The breakfast option was simply packaged cereal, but without milk.\n\nSeriously - stay elsewhere. This business is disgracefully neglected and embarrassing. They’re almost waiting for a Gordon Ramsay episode. Stay in Penola. Stay anywhere. This place is horrendous.",

The few park locals we met were quite friendly, and it's nice and close to the town centre. Will definitely book again if we find ourselves back in Hastings!",

It is a great precinct with the Hotel and plenty of drink and food options. Mineral baths, hot baths, glacier room, sauna, cold plunge, steam room, salt room, waterfall shower, everything you want. Very well appointed, quiet and relaxing, and attentive staff. Would recommend at least one, if not two visits on your stay.",

The 11-step ritual experience is unlike anything we’ve done before — starting with a cleansing salt scrub, followed by drifting through mineral pools, steam rooms, icy plunges, snow mists (yes, real snow indoors!), guided halotherapy meditation, and more. Every step felt intentional and left us feeling lighter, calmer, and genuinely recharged.\n\nThe space itself is stunning — soft lighting, soothing scents, and so much attention to detail, from the Aspar body products in the change rooms to the heated loungers you can relax on between steps.\nThe team was friendly and made the whole experience effortless, letting us go at our own pace while still offering gentle guidance.\n\nIf you’re looking for something more meaningful than just a “spa day,” Aurora is pure wellness heaven. We left feeling like we had hit the reset button on life. Can’t wait to come back!",

The no-children policy in the Spa Dreaming Centre and restaurant made it ideal — much quieter and more relaxing. Stunning gardens, spotlessly clean, and beautifully run despite how busy it was on Christmas Day.\n\nThe Fire & Ice guided sauna was the perfect finale. Our guide Hayley was marvellous and very knowledgeable — all three of us left completely relaxed. Even the towels and robes felt indulgent and high quality.\n\nIf I could give more stars, I would.

The Peninsula Hot Springs is a great location for a family getaway and relaxation is guaranteed.\n\nThere's plenty of parking and the facilities for changing and showering are very clean. There are lockers and towels available for a fee as well, should you need those. You're given a robe to use and I'm glad I brought thongs for my feet as it made moving around much easier.\n\nIt's much larger than I had imagined. There were so many pools to choose from at various locations. I tried the 30° pool as well as the 40° pool and both were excellent. There's a sauna and even a hammam. It was a cold night so I wasn't brave enough to try the ice cave or the ice pool. There's also spa and wellness packages but I will try that next time.\n\nThe location is gorgeous and with opening and closing times so accommodating, you can watch the sun set, as we did, while you're enjoying the view of the trees and listening to natural wildlife sounds. Tickets for us were $55 dollars each so it's not overly expensive but it's still something a family might want to plan for.\n\nIt was definitely a fantastic experience and I do recommend this place for families looking for some rest and relaxation.",
