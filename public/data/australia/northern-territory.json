We left out bags under the trailer where you pay as the staff member said she doesn’t leave the area (there are lockers but they are behind the wave pool). Not many people when we went, maybe 20 of us, so that was good. Everyone had a laugh stacking it. We did hurt our feet/knees on the ‘steps’ climbing up a few of the obstacles, you seem to put your feet on top of the white handles but if you slide down then you really knock yourself on them and they hurt! Overall great fun & highly recommend!",

Only thing is I could see on the days I have been is older kids and adults enjoying the pool also who probably should have been in the bigger pool more suited to their ages or styles of swimming. Also the lighting after 6:30pm is ok but could be more central to the pool and not just the walkways around the toddler pool as the centre doesn’t close until 7:30pm but light fades around 6:30pm. I also was thinking that maybe if you are an adult and would like to swim in the kids pool that you could firstly take a shower or rinse off in the supplied change sheds before taking a swim, as I had seen a couple of adults washing themselves in the pool, not very hygienic for the kids in that situation. Other than that I would rate it 9/10 for the smokes and laughter it brings to my daughter.",

Ever since you have reopened last year, the site and google shows that the pool is open until 9pm. I have verbally been told that the pool closes half an hour earlier but that facilities do not shut down until the displayed time on your site and google. This is what I have been told in my 1+ year of attending Swell.\n\nOn Friday 14/3/2025 I was out of the pool by 8:30pm, left the bathroom after changing by 8:40. Then I was walking near the lockers waiting to be picked up by my father.  The duty manager OJ approached me and told me that I need to leave the facilities and go outside. I've been going to swell for well over a year now and not once have I been told to leave the premises (the pool, yes half an hour earlier than advertised, not the premises though)\n\nOJ told me again that I needed to wait outside. When I told him I was waiting for my ride he relented and changed his statement to, okay just wait near the waiting area.\n\nSince I've never been told this before and it has never been advertised anywhere on the facilities or on your site/online I was a bit bewildered and asked out of curiosity if that was company policy?  OJ said that the pool closes at 8:30pm, okay I know that. I asked about the facilities itself/waiting outside the pool before the actual advertised closing time which I've seen many other customers do and never once has a staff member asked them to leave in the last year.\n\nAfter further inquiry OJ became very passive aggressive and dismissive of my inquiry, I reassured him and the others that I am simply frustrated with the miscommunication and lack of advertising/informing of actual company policy regarding the facilities and closing times. OJ then very rudely stated that he already told me to leave and that the pool closes at 8:30pm, I already know this, I wasn't confused about the bloody pool closing, I was wondering why I was asked to leave the facilities and wait outside to be picked up when this has never once happened before and I and other customers have been allowed to wait until the ACTUAL advertised closing time.\n\nOJ then said that he can't have me waiting near the desk and asked me to leave the facilities and go outside before 9pm because the employees count the money at the end of the day? What kind of logic is that?\n\nThe other employees on duty told me that they understand, and that other customers have sent feedback about this, but failed to understand how my issue was not just with false advertising, it was with being asked to leave the facilities when all I was doing is waiting to be picked up BEFORE the advertising closing time and NOT once have I been told to leave for the last year by other staff. Never had to deal with disrespect from the staff at Swell until today either.\n\nOJ's behaviour was very childish and the junior employees behaviour was quite frustrating and dismissive, OJ was extremely passive aggressive and dismissive of my inquiry and concern and pushed me to a point of great frustration. While two other employees dismissively told me that they've had to wait outside after closing time. I very clearly communicated multiple times that my problem is not with waiting outside after closing time. It's with being told to wait outside and leave BEFORE closing time and then having to deal with a manager that can't admit that his behaviour was unprofessional and extremely rude. OJ also passive aggressively asked me if I'm going to remain here until closing and smiled when I asked him why he's being passive aggressive. What a nutter.\n\nI have never been more disappointed with the customer service and policy at Swell until today. Which is unfortunate because for over a year the staff have been nothing but polite and respectful and don't ask you to leave the waiting area until the actual bloody closing time. I'd like an apology from Swell and from OJ who needs to grow up. And for the love of god, CLEAR UP when you're closed!",

Ever since you have reopened last year, the site and google shows that the pool is open until 9pm.

Before the lady on reception could respond to me, the security woman stood outside the casino door came over in a very rude manor to tell me I couldn’t be here “like this” and needed to get a tshirt on. (For reference I was wearing shorts, crocs, a bikini top and towel around my shoulder)she kept repeating over and over in a tone that I needed to get a top on. (All whilst I was getting my top on). The receptionist apologised for her behaviour, and directed us to the pool. As the receptionist was explaining the details of the pool, the security guard (Marina I think her name was) was still stood behind me rabbiting on to her colleague “she can’t come in like that”.\nI turned around to say “why are you still going on, I’ve put my tshirt on and there was no signage to state I couldn’t be at reception without a top on I was simply asking for directions”.\n\nShe was in a huff and puff and continued to have a tone. I explained it’s a good job we wasn’t looking to book a night here as the first interaction was terrible!!!! Not what you expect for such a high end resort. That’s no way to treat guests.\n\nProps to the receptionist, she was fully capable of doing her job without the security guard coming over.\n\nOn the other hand, the pool was great",

Have toilets have sanitary wipes because they are unisex.\n\n2. The pricing of memberships seems over priced.\n\n3. It would be great to see members actually practising good hygiene rituals by sanitising their equipment after usage. (I saw 10% members cleaning machines 😳)\n\n4. Having members taking full responsibility and racking their weights correctly and not relying on staff to do this.\n\nThanks again for considering my recommendations and having me at your gym.

The location is ideal, easy for guests to get to, with plenty of parking and a relaxed, tropical vibe as soon as you enter the resort.\n\nWe had external vendors come in to set up soft play and decorations, and the team at FreeSpirit was so flexible and accommodating—nothing was too hard, and they really helped take the stress out of the day. Every staff member we spoke to was friendly, professional, and genuinely supportive. You can tell they care about their guests having a great experience.\n\nThe food was delicious and came out exactly on time—hot, fresh, and with generous portions. We had so many compliments from our guests!\n\nWhether you’re hosting a birthday, baby shower, or any type of event, I can’t recommend Darwin FreeSpirit Resort enough. The atmosphere is chilled but polished, and it’s a place where you can truly enjoy the moment while the team takes care of the rest.\n\nThanks again to the FreeSpirit team for helping make our little girl’s first birthday one we’ll never forget 💕🌴",

I will preface this by saying that Sylvia who only took over the management last week, this  is not a reflection of on you.\nThis park is not worth the money. The sites are small and everyone is crowded on top of each other. The amenities are abysmal and after 8 days the same crap was still in the plug holes in the showers. A very poor attempt was made to blow the leaves away (which are in abundance and we understand that this is a nightmare to keep on top of) the pool was HEATED!!!!! Can you believe it? 31* humidity 45%, no need for this.\nWe did need to change our booking which was done and we were thankful but sitting outside our van at 10:30 we got a call to say we should have checked out at 10:00am and they said they didn’t have any sites left for us. I quickly found another park and booked in. We packed up and then the young groundsman came and said they found a site for us. Too late! When our friends checked out she was spoken to very rudely. Seriously, this place needs to be demolished and rebuilt. So disappointing!",

I say this for a variety of reasons including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:\n- Our allocated site (9) was tiny and barely fit the tent and car, there was no way we could have safely lit a fire or set up a shelter or anything additional.\n- The campsites all sit directly on the bitumen road - they are not protected, secluded or hidden whatsoever. Cars and people going past were noisy and intrusive. There is no privacy.\n- The campsite ground surface was pure rock, with smaller rocks scattered on top - you could not place a single peg in the ground, one sharp rock damaged the tent floor, and our daughter injured her knee merely from playing on the ground.\n- Our allotted site (9) was infested with ants.\n- The sites were jammed in super close to one another meaning we were up til 1am listening to our drinking neighbours.\n\nOne positive - the showers were reasonable.\n\nOn balance, would not recommend this site.",

Bad atmosphere in hostel itself, mostly long-term stays not travellers. Kitchen really badly equipped, you struggle to find a knife to chop with, and the washing up liquid is so watered down it felt unsanitary. You can rent a cutlery set from the hostel but the staff didn’t explain any of this when we got there so we just bought our own. Passive aggressive notes everywhere complaining about mess in the kitchen and threatening to fine you. I could excuse all of the above if it wasn’t for what I’m about to say. We were due to leave Darwin on our last day at 7am for a tour down to Litchfield NP. Hostel sends out email 3pm the previous day saying they’re doing “emergency” works and there’ll be no water whatsoever to entire property 5-7am. I asked staff what we should do as this included no flushing toilets, no ability to get water in kitchen etc. and we needed to leave before 7. They said use toilet at 4:50am. Just outrageous and inappropriate, especially with how much this place costs. We had to leave and book a new place for the night - I asked for a partial refund for this last night we wouldn’t be there and they said no. Just don’t bother - stay somewhere else this is honestly not worth the (literal) headache. I came all the way from England to see Darwin and it’s so sad that this experience put a dampener on my precious time there. Don’t make the mistake i did.

I came all the way from England to see Darwin and it’s so sad that this experience put a dampener on my precious time there. Don’t make the mistake i did. Photos attached of room, view of construction through screen, tradesperson access into hostel and construction site (windows of majority of hostel rooms!).",

I stayed for seven nights and was very happy with everything, although I did move rooms as I found standing in the bath to shower too slippery. The price was amazing and included continental breakfast. The plunge pool was a nice luxury. The rooms were large and comfortable: walk-in shower, dry bar with good sized fridge, glasses and cups, work desk and balcony.\nIt seems to be a long-stay kind of place, but the lack of kitchen sink and microwave/hotplate would limit that for me (however, you can use the communal microwave in the breakfast room).\nThe king bed was very comfortable and the pillows and towels were fine. Wifi was included and undercover parking was available for a fee. Walking to the city centre took about 15 minutes, but there were restaurants and grocery stores nearby.\nReceptionists were helpful and welcoming.",

The holiday up to this point was filled with 1st class service and experiences.  Then we got to the vibe hotel. On the positive side, the location is great and the breakfast nice. That’s about it though. On check in, I asked about a late check out (our flights leave late at night) and the immediate response was it’s $30 per hour and they would not recommend it. I asked if there was a room or shower we can use to freshen up and get changed before we leave, I was told we could pay for another night. We are welcome to use the outdoor shower by the hotel pool, which is not really practical, and we can use the disabled toilets to get changed. Some other really simple things to fix, offer to take guests luggage to their rooms (our room is approx. 250m from reception). I cannot remember the last time I stayed at a hotel and there was no complimentary water and/or a bottle and a note asking guests to refill from the tap. The staff are friendly and pleasant when you ask about this, however, they seem to have accepted that the standard is what is and they cannot help. Has this ruined our holiday? Absolutely not. It’s the little things that make the difference though, and my perception is that they have given up at the vibe hotel so I will avoid the chain in future.",

From the new digs, expect a new and clean toilet area (from pics), showers , washing facilities and a trucker's lounge. At the trucker's lounge you can find a smart tv, some chill couches and a quiet area if you need peace. In the main area there is rather a large area for you to sit and relax whilst eating. Expect to find USB ports and PowerPoints for recharging your devices (which I found quite handy). Of course there is no wifi (for those that are data savvy), so make sure to bring your phone or hotspot device. Washing and drying are $4.00 to use, and in addition to the showers you will have to ask for a key at the front counter(couldn't get in as it was locked hence no photos) . The cafe is full of hot and fresh food from the Bain Maree, or you can order fresh from the menu. Prices are reasonable considering the 24 hour opening times, (see pics). There is a variety of food and drinks to chose from, so your really covered (as well as the typical servo stock). Coffee is a hot and miss with this place pending on who is making it. However the food is quite nice and tasty (for a servo), and it's rather a premium upgrade from those that order servo food. I recommend giving it a go and trying it out. The place of course is nice with working aircon, also the large smartscreen tv in the trucker's lounge is great for sports or news. Now about the Feul, considering the bowsers, they are new and fill up a tad quicker than most. I haven't done the bottle test, however the Feul does look extremely clean, and I haven't had an issue with the use in my car or motorbike. Prices are reasonable (you will notice). The staff are friendly and local (with occasional unistudents, or international people) so you know you can have a good yarn about your travel adventures (or life lol). Apart from that I found the place nice to relax , sit-down and eat, and rather clean, they still haven't got the newspapers (I'm old fashioned) however they do have a variety of magazines. There are different types of healthy food and sandwiches (you can see). I recommend the chips with gravy, it's rather a light touch! (Or ask for it fresh). Enjoy :)",

Tonight was leftover meat and frozen peas and corn in a large Chinese container. The person in the kitchen also tried to claim that the kitchen normally would close between 6pm-7pm (at a 24hour truck stop!? Please!) and that meals served after then as always this way, I have never been to this location before 8pm, so I know that is a lie as well. Really disappointing service and food. Plenty of other places around town that people can shower and get food at that is way better than this and at least those places get cleaned, dining area here was a mess when we arrived and still had not changed by the time we left. Apparently, none of the 4 staff know how to clean tables. Don't waste your time or money here, it's not worth it.",

The person in the kitchen also tried to claim that the kitchen normally would close between 6pm-7pm (at a 24hour truck stop!? Please!) and that meals served after then as always this way, I have never been to this location before 8pm, so I know that is a lie as well. Really disappointing service and food. Plenty of other places around town that people can shower and get food at that is way better than this and at least those places get cleaned, dining area here was a mess when we arrived and still had not changed by the time we left. Apparently, none of the 4 staff know how to clean tables. Don't waste your time or money here, it's not worth it.",

The shower cubicles are spacious with a toilet, however there is no door on the shower recess and the water runs into the centre of the room so there is no where dry to stand when you've finished showering and Tring to get dressed",

She released a lot of tension on my upper back and my hips, I feel very relaxed throughout the treatment. Facial was amazing (something that I didn't expect as a part of the package, overlooked when I booked in with this mama brain) it was a lovely surprise! The tea, hot towel and chocolate at the end was just a sweet touch to wrap up a beautiful and relaxing treatment. Overall, beautiful spa, clean and aesthetically-pleasing too.  Thank you ❤️",

The environment was so calming the moment you stepped in and the head massages were incredible. A very relaxing environment with beautiful soothing music and the sound of running water in the background when you get your hair washed, you can definitely fall asleep from it. Have to admit the water halo was a bit ticklish for me but still enjoyable. My hair was so amazingly soft and smooth afterwards. Thank you so much Catt!

It's actually a lovely walk in with all the huge red gum trees lining the dry creek bed.\n\nPool was refreshing and even jumped in the spa once it got dark. Rooms were comfortable though bathroom is dated.

Cabins are very nice, clean, comfortable and fully equipped which was perfect for us during our visit before collecting the campervan. The campervan spaces and facilities were exceptional, the site is very quite, very clean, showers hot, kitchen facilities excellent (all kept very clean, not full of dirt, mud and hairs, the grounds staff deserve applause for their dedication) there is a dump point on site too, and the pool is great for adults and kids alike. The staff in the office are to be commended for their great approach, politeness, patience and overall customer service.  Highly recommended if you need a great place to stay during your visit to Alice Springs.",

Although we didnt need it, the camp kitchen looks well equipped with microwave and fridges. The amenities block is clean and the showers have great pressure and hot water.  Jason is also a friendly and helpful host. Would definitely stay here again even if it was in one of the on site cabins!",

          "reviewText": "We just stayed at this campsite over the last few nights. We booked based on what we saw online, without having checked it out first. The plus side in our opinion, is that the campsite is attached to the pub, which may not suit everyone. We liked the pub and had a great meal there. In the summer it would be great with the outside area and the pools. It was too cold for us this time unfortunately. This would encourage us to at least stop in again in the summer.\nAs for the campground, this was a basic unsheltered mostly patch of dirt. The unpowered sites were cheap so we weren't too fussed about the looks of the place. Unfortunately there was no handy camp kitchen. The BBQ areas only had cold water for dishes and you had to pay to use the BBQS. We hadn't seen that at a paid site before. We usually expect at least a free camp kitchen. We did put our money in on one night to do steaks but it turned off well before our food was cooked and we ended up cooking in our van in the end. A waste of money and effort! We don't even like our steaks cooked for long! As for the toilets and showers. It looks at though they were installed within the last few years and that was probably the last clean they had. This area was depressing and filthy. I noticed cleaning equipment sitting outside the block a few times but maybe they were put there by staff who were pretending to management that they had cleaned. When we arrived I had a look into the cubicles and they were horrendous! Every day I had another look to check if things had been cleaned and NO. Before we left, I was so used to seeing this sight that I could describe the mess in detail and was 100% sure nothing had been cleaned. So in general, it was a dirty and depressing place to stay with the only real benefit being the close proximity of the pub. Also, the security gates around the campsite never seemed to be locked at night and we had one of our camping neighbours shooing people away from going through people's things by their vehicles. NOT really safe either!! We're on the road a LOT and this is one of the worst campsites we've come across unfortunately.",

She was very friendly and helpful over the phone and unbelievably thorough and totally organised when she made our booking.  But unfortunately, shortly after our booking was made, we caused disruption to our booking dates by having to check in earlier than expected.  A major fault had occurred when travelling with our caravan.  We were worried that we wouldn’t make it into Alice Springs.  We had to get there urgently as we needed to get the caravan repaired so we could get it up and running and be on our way.  Helen was just fantastic in fitting us in and accommodating us earlier than our expected arrival date and at such short notice.  Thank you so much Helen, we appreciate it.  Our thanks also go out to the Caretaker who phoned through our situation to Helen.  Although it was very late in the day, he then permitted us to enter the Park and allowed us to gain access through the gate.\nBlatherskite Park Campground offers very affordable grassy and spacious powered and unpowered sites.  You are not camped on top of each other here unlike that of a certain caravan park where we once regrettably stayed in Alice Springs. It is very quiet too, being just out of town - you get to relax here and that’s got to be well worth it.\nThe amenities, though dated, are very clean and well maintained and the showers are always lovely and hot.\nThere are skips located in the Park Campground for your rubbish and the grounds are well maintained and mowed regularly and it’s all quite neat and tidy.\nNo negatives at all.  In fact we loved it here.  Great value for money with perfect hosts offering fantastic service.  What more could you want?  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  If and when we return to Alice Springs, this is where we will be staying.  Thank you all at Blatherskite Park - we really appreciate what you do!",

Helen was fabulous at organising the sites so that we were all spread out and not on top of to eachother like at caravan parks. This was great because we have dogs and it meant that they weren't distracted by other campers right next door. She also suggested areas for us to let our dogs run. It was such a nice change to have big trees for shade and grass under our feet. The showgrounds are a bit of a community hub and it was lovely to sew people ride their horses around the park and oval. The sunsets are fabulous at the showgrounds and the drive in and out of town is also beautiful as you cut through the large rockfaces. On the very last day we saw an emu just over the fence of the showgrounds which was pretty exciting! All the amenities were in good working order and kept clean. The whole place felt relaxing and fuss free. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved seeing all the horses!",

Fantastic relaxing camping experience away from the hustle and bustle yet 15 min drive to town. Toilets and showers are clean but slightly small in showers though plenty of hot water we really didn’t care too much about the size.\nIt doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but suited us and our 2 dogs perfectly. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Trish for a delightful experience.",

Would go back for them in a heart beat. And the same with the freaking awesome burgers we had for lunch = forced us into a wine and cheese evening + finishing with a cuppa soup, when we got back to Alice.\nThe bathrooms were sensational- FOUR pegs in each to hang stuff + wooden floor mat, oh and a loo included. Plenty of camping space, though lucky us, had the ones camp beside us where I could touch both campers arms outstretched - too close buddy for bush camping! A camp kitchen, not checked out, as we were too busy eating in the pub!",

Would go back for them in a heart beat. And the same with the freaking awesome burgers we had for lunch = forced us into a wine and cheese evening + finishing with a cuppa soup, when we got back to Alice.\nThe bathrooms were sensational- FOUR pegs in each to hang stuff + wooden floor mat, oh and a loo included. Plenty of camping space, though lucky us, had the ones camp beside us where I could touch both campers arms outstretched - too close buddy for bush camping! A camp kitchen, not checked out, as we were too busy eating in the pub!",

I’ve seen people in the reviews complain about size but each spot seems to be large enough for a caravan & the spots aren’t sitting on top of one another, for the most part. This place is huge! Luckily we’re off grid as we had ‘Overflow 2’ camp spot & it was quite a walk to the toilets/showers. There are single or shared fire pits at most sites & there are shared BBQs at the toilet blocks, with picnic tables & chairs, surrounded by cyclone fencing, no doubt to keep the wildlife away from your food. Sprinklers keep campsite grass luscious for our enjoyment. Host Anne greeted us upon our arrival, & thank goodness, because it’s easy to get lost in here. Do yourself a favour & take a photo of the map upon entry to help. NOTE: Host resides at site 39 if you need help. What you read about the online booking system is true. When we got here, Anne said our campsite didn’t exist & found a spot to fit our car & caravan, however, had to do the same again that evening for someone else who was booked where we’d been put. Anne was with Optus & was able to get clarification on campsite bookings the following day. She also arranged for additional nights as we are with Telstra & no service here. If you walk outside of the campsite towards Roper River you’ll find plenty of walking tracks & fishing spots, but it’s a bit rocky & some climbing is needed. There’s a boat ramp near 12 Mile Yards Day Use Area along with more hiking trails through to Mularark, Mataranka Falls & 4 Mile. There are signs to hike all the way through the bushland, along the river, but away from the riverbank, all the way down John Hauser Drive. There is no laundromat in town but the local caravan park agreed for us to use their facilities. BRING PLENTY OF FOOD! Especially if you have certain requirements. The supermarket shelves were quite bare & being so rural probably don’t stock up often. Plenty of frozen meat of small portions & 150-200% of a city price. Locals were friendly when we were wandering around town during the day. Host Anne told us we could use the taps at the toilet blocks for drinking water as it’s filtered river water & she claims “it’s great!”. As of 5 July 2023 the council dump point was closed noted \"out of service\" with no other information. Advised by the caravan park that the closest dump points are Larrimah NT (48 minutes 76km) or Katherine NT (1 hour 9 minutes or 108km). C U in the N T! ;)",

Great hot showers, gas bbqs and a brilliant Grade 2 walk along the river to Mataranka Falls. Very quiet, great feeling about the place. Close to other things to see and do like Bitter Springs.",

First night was good 👍🏼 next day I went on the mataranka falls hike.. which was good also 👍🏼 on my return to camp...EVERYTHING was saturated wet, I was camping in a tent. My whole camp looked like it had just been dumped in the river.. my swag and bedding was floating in a pool of water. The host had forgotten to take out the sprinkler which was in the ground and the ranger turned them in while I was hiking. Nothing was salvageable without at least 48hours of drying time. I had to pack up my camp.. soaking wet into my car and tried to get accommodation in mataranka, as it is the dry season EVERYWHERE was booked out so I drove to Katherine where I was met with the same thing except for 1 room available at the cost of $285 and was definitely not the hilton. I then tried pine creek, same situation. I had to drive back to Darwin, arrived home 10.45 that night. Spent the next 2days of my leave washing, drying and airing out camp gear and my car 🤬 not a happy camper. So I leave you all with a very good tip if your to stay at this campground, please ask the host to take out the sprinkler as is their job for staying there. Happy travels people 🌈🦋🌈🌈🦋🦋🏕️",

There's a lot of communal, cosy features, like the Book Room, free food in the kitchen, shared games, decently-sized kitchen, tea/coffee, etc. We stayed in the caravan which got quite cold at night, would be great if it had warmer blankets/heavier donnas (acrylic blankets do not help...). The heater helped but for sustainability, don't want to leave it on all night! Not at lot of space for luggage so it helped that we could leave things in the car. Beds etc are basic and a bit worn but there's obviously a lot of love and fun put into the set-up of different rooms, the bus, etc and it's pretty fair for the price of a hostel in Australia.\nThe car park requires some creativity, communication and logistics to manage...The whole hostel is quite secure with both gates having a combination lock. Location is good too.",

The larger sites are very spacious. However, in recent times the amenities have really, really deteriorated. The toilet blocks are very stinky (under-maintained septic tanks?); showers are often cold, soap runs out. The kiosk doesn't provide any ice (not sure if it ever did, come to think of it, but this would be a really handy service given that the nearest ice is 45mins + away). It would be so lovely if these amenities could be returned to something like their former glory from when the campground was commercially managed. In their current condition they are a hygiene risk and off putting.",

We are FSC, so had no need to use amenities or camp kitchen, so can't comment unfortunately, but if the rest is anything to go by, will be fine. They had a water truck patrolling throughout the day to keep dust down, but to be honest, there wasn't a lot of wind to stir it up anyway. Terrific sites, with plenty of shade around. Staff were very friendly and helpful.\nTake a leisurely 8 minute stroll to the Bitter Springs. Life doesn't get much better. The water is warm and clear. Bring a noodle or 2, and just let the current take you to the bridge, get out, walk back and repeat. No cost, just need the parks pass. Didn't see any fish, but there were a number of turtles, so bring goggles and a new world will be opened up to you.\nAlthough fully paved with concrete paths, unfortunately no ramp or easy access for disabled, other than physically lifting in and out of the water.",

The room looked unclean and shabby, with bedsheets being dirty and they were charging 120 bucks for it. They offered me another room but when I checked that one , it was no different either. I complained about it and they refunded my money without dramas, so that part was alright. There is a swimming pool that looks more like a pond with disgusting stale water. This place should not be open as it does not meet the basic hygene standards .Guys please check the rooms before booking.",

It doesn't look accessible to the public from the highway due to the white fence but it is open during the day.\n\nThere is a carpark with quite a few spots and two spots for people in wheelchairs. There is a flying fox and an all direction swing plus plenty more. There is a toddler playground and then another playground for primary then a playground section for middle primary to lower high school years.\n\nThere is a chilled drinking fountain and a BBQ. Plenty of shade with trees including grass areas and there are quality shade structures over the playgrounds and eating area where there are also two picnic tables. The shade structures are effective because the wind cools you down as you move around on the playground or sit at the picnic table. I wonder if more BBQs would be appropriate particularly during the dry season.\n\nThere are plenty of toilets and a toilet for people in wheelchairs.\n\nSadly vandalism has happened and parts of the playground have been damaged but the white fence around the playground might be preventing further damage.\n\nThe skate park is also next to the adventure playground with the recreation centre close by. The upgraded swimming pool will be completed next year which is also next to the carpark for the playground.\n\nA special feature in Katherine particularly for families visiting or staying in Katherine. The information centre in Katherine should promote it to families.\n\nA thank you message is certainly relevant to the local council for providing a quality and diverse playground with quality shade.",
