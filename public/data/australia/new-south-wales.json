At the reception they have some basics like goggles, swim caps etc just in case you forgot at home",

I personally come out of the pool sweating profusely and red faced after swimming my usual 2-3kms. My heart rate is elevated beyond my normal training range and performance reduced.\n\nMy online research of leading swim associations (e.g. USA Swimming) is that public training pools should not exceed 27 degrees, but ideally be closer to 24 - 26 degrees. Higher pool temperatures above these levels can lead to dehydration, overheating and other health risks.\n\nI'm not alone in this feeling, many regular users have shared similar distress with me at how hot the pool is.

With multiple pools available, it’s great for lap swimming, casual dips, or joining one of the many activities they run for both seniors and young children.

I loved that its all fully wheelchair accessible - everything is on the same level. 👩‍🦼👩‍🦽✅ So you can easily access one of the three pools, sauna and bathrooms. They also have ramps to enter the water and proper stairs to easily get out. Also I loved the temperature of the pool - it's not too cold as some pools and it's not too warm. So you can get a decent work out without overheating but at the same time you won't freeze during the cool down.\n\nThe only downside, on weekends it's full of kids squads. So there are only 4 lanes available for public swimming. But it's amazingly organized - all lanes are separated and clearly marked. So there will be no water walkers in a fast lane and vice versa.\n\nI definitely will come back!!! 🙌",

The sauna and steam room are honestly what keep me coming back, they’re super relaxing, especially after a long swim. I really hope they stay well-maintained because they’re definitely the best part of this gym.\n\nThe 50-meter pool itself feels great to swim in, and the temperature is always comfortable. The water quality isn’t the cleanest I’ve ever seen, sometimes you can spot a bandaid or a bit of debris floating around, but it’s still acceptable overall.\n\nHowever I do want to mention this gigantic cockroach I saw today on the ceiling of the women’s changing room (quite disturbing). I understand it’s getting hot now, which makes it easier for them to appear, but I still think a changing room should be clean and feel safe to use. I really hope the staff can do a proper pest control inspection soon, it would make a big difference.\n\n(By the way, recently I saw a mother bring her son, who looked around nine, into the women’s changing room. He was already old enough and kept staring at other women inside, which was really inappropriate. I think it’s better to have a family changing room instead and leave the women's changing room to women.)",

It also took out part of a frequently used staircase for beach access.\n​Safety Note: Fortunately, no injuries were reported, likely because the heavy rain meant fewer people were in the immediate area at the time. The site is currently an exclusion zone as a geotechnical assessment is reviewed to guide safe remediation works.\n​🏗️ Construction & Redevelopment Review\n​Separate from the cliff remediation, the historic Bronte Surf Life Saving Club and Community Facilities are undergoing a significant upgrade.",

It is slightly elevated so it looks across the ocean and down upon the beach. The towering sandstone cliffs and rock formations are a dramatic backdrop.\nBuilt in the 1880s at a time when it was considered highly risky for men and women to mix, the baths were highly regulated. Swimming was only allow between daylight hours of 10am - 4pm. Goodness knows what might happen in the dark. Gentlemen could bathe 7 days a week but ladies were forbidden on Sundays and public holidays. Today entry is free, but when it was new, entry was fourpence (adults) and tuppence (children).\nThe baths are perfect for smaller children or for those who are are inexperienced swimmers. It offers a safer swimming space, where you can still swim in ocean water but are protected from tricky rips, shifting currents and rough surf.\nBarrier at one end divides the serious swimming section where lanes are marked out for laps, from the area where you can just have a splash around.\nThe surrounding rock platform is a good area to set up your towels and sit in the sun.\nNOTE: Don’t leave without walking the very short distance up the path past the Baths to the end of the headland. It has absolutely beautiful ocean views and striking sandstone formations.",

When I reached the middle of the lane, my goggles came off and I started panicking. I was swallowing a lot of water and struggling to stay above surface, kept raising my hands trying to get the lifeguard’s attention, but no one came to help me until I swam back to the edge by myself and was completely exhausted. The lifeguard finally noticed me at that time and asked if I needed help and pulled me out of the pool - which was nice, but only after I nearly drowned.\n\nThis was my first time here. The front desk staff were very friendly and the lifeguard seemed nice enough, but I will never come back.\n\nPlease don’t bother calling me about this review - I won’t answer",

Watsons Bay Baths, Sydney\n​The Watsons Bay Baths are a true Sydney gem, offering a historic and scenic harbour swimming experience that is popular with locals and visitors alike. If you're looking for a refreshing dip with stunning views, this tidal enclosure is an excellent choice.\n​✨ Key Highlights\n​Location and View: Situated right on Sydney Harbour, the view is spectacular. You can enjoy glimpses of the Harbour Bridge and the city skyline while you swim. The whole area has a beautiful, old-fashioned, friendly feel.\n​Facilities: The baths are a large, netted harbour enclosure that has been recently renovated.\n​Swimming Area: The enclosure is sizable, with a swimming area measuring approximately 50m x 45m. There is an outer pool of about 50m x 14m, which is often laned for serious lap swimmers.\n​Pontoons: Two floating pontoons are available for sunbathing, turning during laps, or just pausing to enjoy the water.\n​Accessibility: A standout feature is the excellent accessibility, including an all-ability water access ramp and two fully immersible wheelchairs (MLAK key access required for wheelchairs and lockers). This makes it a fantastic resource for people with mobility issues.\n​Vibe: It offers a great mix—you'll see serious swimmers doing laps alongside people simply relaxing and sunbathing on the pontoons. Being a tidal pool, the water is clean harbour water, and it's securely shark-netted.\n​Surrounding Amenities: Nearby facilities include:\n​Change rooms and a freshwater shower.\n​A Tea Gardens area with a shaded outdoor kiosk (check opening times).\n​Cafes and picnic areas are available nearby in Watsons Bay.\n​⚠️ A Few Things to Note\n​Tidal Variation: Like many harbour baths, the area has significant tidal variations. At high tide, the small beach area may be almost non-existent.\n​Depth: The swimming area is deep, especially in the laned section (around 3m or so), meaning you can't easily stand for a breather, making it better for confident swimmers.\n​Popularity: While it might not be as busy as Bondi Beach, it is a well-loved spot and can get busy, especially on weekends and in summer.\n​⭐ Verdict\n​The Watsons Bay Baths are a must-visit for anyone who loves swimming in Sydney's stunning harbour. The combination of its historical charm, great swimming facilities (including the 50m stretch), and the commitment to all-ability access makes it one of the city's finest public baths.",

DB up to 150lbs, free weights, lots of machines, and some cables. Had a plyo type area on second level as well as Locker rooms and bathrooms (which were clean).  Pretty easy to work in even in the busy times.    People were friendly and chill.   The owner was a really nice guy as well encourage my kid to keep putting in work.\n\nI think it was $25 Australian (like $15 USD) per day which wasn’t too bad or $99 ($65ish USD) for the week.",

Gym is meant to bring health and positive aspects to our life.\n\nI was a previous member at Snap fitness in Perth, where the situation was very different and have moved to Sydney in the last 2 weeks. The Clarence Street location was the most convenient for me to attend.\n\nI tried to the manager (whom is hardly ever at the reception desk and only found exercising) as to work with improvements for a filthy environment is unacceptable.\n\nThe gym has no soaps in most of the toilet sinks, stations where wipes are located is super dirty around… the other day there was not a single alcohol gel bottle filled to be used. Dust is everywhere especially weight sections. This week the stair climber equipment has a spider web right in front, with a spider hanging there.\n\nThe manager asked me to send him an e-mail yesterday, which I did. I wrote and included pictures as to the matter.  I wasn´t comfortable with the fact that I had already spoken and no one else was in copy as to address the issue. The manager replied to my e-mail on the same day, informing those actions would be taken, but on the following day I was surprised with an unexpected incident today towards me.\n\nToday, I was surprised with a rude approach from one member, which and opted not to reply and continued with my music and exercise. I didn´t respond and wished the man “all the best” when we left the gym at the same time. Latter that day the same manager sent me an e-mail filled with lies as if I was the one with inappropriate behavior in the gym, when I was the one who received an unexpected attitude when returning the man´s towel.  The manager wrote that I had inappropriate behavior at the gym, to members and staff members. That I was no longer welcome at the gym. This is a lie and didn´t occurred at all!!\n\nI am surprises and shocked with these two incidents which apparently might be connected… I felt so unsafe today. I was the only women and was mistreated and later received an email filled with lies. I only wanted to use one of the 3 benches, which 2 were being used and the third was occupied by his towel. I decided to wait and do another exercise. While I was doing a rep of 4x18, the man that left his towel at the beach only came once. Once I was finished, I literally went to him and ask if I could use the equipment. He said yes. Which was great. I had music on my ears and grab his towel to give it back to him. OMG! That guy, freaked out, he was so arrogant, saying he could grab the towel himself and that I was rude to touch his towel. He kept speaking rudely towards me (I felt harassed). That was just awful! I felt so mistreated by the tone of his voice and the way he kept speaking to me. I said I didn’t hear him and didn’t know it was rude to give the towel back to him. Afterward I only said: “you’re a very rude man, and I’m glad I’m not listening to you, as I have headphones on”. It was awful, really. I felt terrible and didn’t feel safe at all.\n\nI am very surprised with this entire situation and neve had similar experience. I find this experience at this gym unacceptable.\n\nAll the best\n\nJulianna",

The atmosphere and ambience is definitely one of its pluses – it’s quiet and relaxing, dim but not dark – as its name ‘health and wellness club’ suggests. I particularly like the sauna and bath facility as personally it really makes a big difference to post-workout comfort. Even the hairdryer is nice to use. Fob is provided for after-hours access. Parking is not easy as with any location in Sydney CBD but close enough to Martin Pl metro.",

Perhaps the worst maintained FF gym in the entirety of Sydney. Disgusting actually. Just a sample of lockers, toilets out of order. Plus their claim that the gym is 24hrs is a total sham. Friday afternoon at 5pm & saunas are locked because no staff rostered & gym users are expected to enter & exit the gym via filthy fire stairs. And they actively advise against using lockers when reception is unstaffed (which is most of the time) so good luck with your wallet, keys & any valuables! Save your money & go elsewhere. Almost any gym in Newtown is better than this dump.",

I left the swimming pool area at 7:00 pm and assumed the female change room was still open, as it is at Pitt Street Fitness First.\n\nHowever, a gym staff member named Ryan came into the female change room and started yelling at me and other customers, saying that the gym was closed. I asked him to please be polite and explained that I would leave as soon as possible, but he continued to yell at me multiple times.\n\nI also explained to him that I am new to this gym and was not aware of the change room closing time. I suggested that the gym should clearly display the closing time on the female change room door so that members won’t get confused in the future. Despite this, he kept yelling at me and another customer. His behaviour was aggressive and unnecessary.\n\nI left immediately after I understood the timetable, but I was in such a rush that I lost my bikini in the gym. At first, I thought only certain areas, such as the swimming pool, would close earlier—not the entire gym. I was also confused because I thought this was a 24-hour gym.\n\nHis abusive behaviour was absolutely unacceptable. A staff member should never treat customers this way. I cried on my way home because of how he made me feel. 😭",

It always has a musty smell and the change rooms and bathrooms are so small and cramped. The toilets also often had skid marks and clumped up toilet paper which is just disgusting. There are fans which provide some semblance of fresh air but it’s just recirculating nasty air. We’ve noticed odd looking spots on the walls which could be mould but again, if the mould doesn’t affect you, the lack of oxygen definitely will. The layout of the bottom level is also terrible. The squat racks, hip-thrust and squat machine are placed so close together that it’s incredibly awkward to grab weights and set up. The left squat rack is also so close to the wall which makes it difficult to do anything. Also there is zero signal in this gym.

          "reviewText": "Very disappointing experience as a paying member.\n\nI have been a member of Anytime Fitness, but my recent experience has left me shocked and frustrated. I was training dance moves in an almost empty gym during a quiet time (weekday noon, 12–1 PM), and was unexpectedly asked to leave by a staff member. The reason? I was “disturbing others.” However, the gym was nearly empty, and there was plenty of space around me. I fail to understand how my quiet solo training could possibly disturb anyone.\n\nNowhere in the membership contract does it state that dancing or movement training is prohibited. As a paying member, I believe I have the same right to train as everyone else, whether it’s weights, cardio, or dance-based workouts. This kind of treatment felt unfair and discriminatory.\n\nOn top of that, the gym is not well-maintained. The floors are dirty, and overall hygiene is substandard — especially disappointing for a fitness facility.\n\nThis incident has left me extremely dissatisfied. I expected a welcoming and inclusive training environment, not to be judged or kicked out for how I choose to move my body. I sincerely hope the management reconsiders how they treat their members and enforces rules based on fairness, not personal bias.",

Toilets are not cleaned regularly and once had toilet paper missing so I  had to run to other toilet while no one sees me. Not premium. No free passes for friends. That also does not feel premium. Once I went to spa at 9:40pm and one of the staff said I have 5 minutes to enjoy, but then I was approached by other staff member and he basically asked me to leave now. Does not feel premium also, because I was watching the time and would have left gym on time.\n\nHere are some pictures of the gym few days after I first wrote review. Looks even worse. There was no toilet paper in several toilet cabins.\n\nIf you are as squeamish as me I don’t recommend this place.",

I can't personally sacrifice doing either of those classes for a cycle class but I'm told they are also amazing.\n\nThe coaches are full of personality, passionate, encouraging and professional at all times. As a result every person attending these classes gives their all. This is where the magic lies. I have never been to a class where the standard is so consistently high. It's inspiring and you find yourself pushing harder than you thought possible just because of the people around you.\n\nThere are other gyms with more showers and range of classes but they just don't have the magic of this gym.

What stands out is Jamie's clear explanations of how to correctly do specific exercises to ensure the right muscles are engaged.\nWhat I always appreciate is how flexible Jamie is to cater to a range of fitness needs and easily adapts an exercise to suit if you have an injury or coming back after a holiday break.\nAs a whole, the atmosphere is very welcoming with very friendly members,  open to chat and inclusive of everyone. Very easy to feel like you are part of the group and makes the sessions all that more enjoyable - more so when it is a harder workout.\nLocation is central Chatswood with free parking available underneath the gym - very practical, or free street parking before 8:30 am. There are also changing room/shower facilities, which I personally have not used, but have seen other members leave refreshed and ready for work. Great place, recommend it if you want to get fit be it cardio, strength, overall wellbeing!",

There is also a small kiosk where you can grab snacks and drinks, which adds to the convenience. The views across the harbour are stunning, and the sunsets here are truly magical. It’s also close to Hornby Lighthouse and other walking tracks, so you can combine a visit to several scenic spots in one trip.

It offers the classic Australian beach experience with a vibrant, friendly atmosphere that makes it a fantastic day trip or holiday destination.\n​🏖️ The Beach & Vibe\n​The main beach is a magnificent stretch of golden sand, backed by a picturesque promenade lined with iconic Norfolk Pine trees. It runs for about 1.5km, offering plenty of space for everyone.\n​Surfing: Manly is famous for its waves and was the site of the first World Surfing Championship. It's an excellent spot for all levels, with surf schools offering lessons for beginners.\n​Swimming: The beach is fully patrolled, and for those who prefer calmer water, the sheltered Manly Cove is right on the harbour side, perfect for families.\n​Atmosphere: It strikes a great balance—lively and energetic without the sometimes overwhelming crowds of Bondi. It feels distinctly relaxed, like a true beach resort town.\n​🚶‍♀️ Things to Do (Beyond the Sand)\n​Manly offers far more than just swimming and sunbathing:\n​The Corso: This pedestrian mall connects the ferry wharf to the ocean beach, bustling with surf shops, cafes, ice cream spots, and markets on the weekends.\n​Manly to Shelly Beach Walk: This short, beautiful coastal walk takes you past the historic Fairy Bower Pool to the sheltered Shelly Beach, which is a fantastic spot for snorkeling and scuba diving due to its protected marine reserve status.\n​Coastal Walks: For more adventure, you can tackle the breathtaking Manly to Spit Bridge Scenic Walkway or explore the historic sites and stunning views from North Head Sanctuary.\n​🍽️ Food and Drink\n​Manly's dining scene is excellent, ranging from casual beachfront fish and chips to upscale restaurants:\n​Waterfront Dining: Spots like The Pantry Manly or those along Manly Wharf offer fantastic views while you eat.\n​Diverse Cuisine: You'll find everything from Italian (like Hugos or Busta) and Mexican (Chica Bonita) to classic Australian pubs and seafood.\n​Coffee & Gelato: The Corso and surrounding streets are filled with amazing cafes and, of course, essential gelato shops.\n​🛥️ Getting There\n​The journey is an experience in itself! Taking the Manly Ferry from Circular Quay is the best way to arrive, providing incredible views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. It only takes about 30 minutes.\n​✨ Final Verdict\n​Manly Beach is the quintessential Sydney beach experience. It combines a world-class surfing beach with calm harbour-side coves, stunning walks, and a vibrant dining precinct, all easily accessible via a beautiful ferry ride. If you have time for only one beach in Sydney, many locals would tell you to choose Manly.",

If you're looking for a stunning stretch of sand without the crazy crowds of Bondi or Manly, this is your place.\n​Gorgeous Scenery and Calm Waters: The sand is beautifully soft and the waters of Botany Bay are wonderfully calm, making it perfect for families, a relaxing swim, or a gentle paddle. The netted swimming area offers an extra layer of peace of mind.\n​Vibrant \"Little Greece by the Bay\": The atmosphere is fantastic. The Grand Parade is lined with superb cafes and restaurants, especially the vibrant Greek eateries that give the area its nickname. It's an ideal spot to grab a coffee, a delicious meal, or a gelato right by the water.\n​Unique Plane Spotting Experience: A truly unique feature is the proximity to Sydney Airport. Watching the planes descend right over the bay adds a cool, dramatic backdrop to your beach day that you won't find anywhere else in Sydney.\n​Fantastic Foreshore: The beach is complemented by Cook Park, which offers excellent walking/cycling paths, picnic areas, and playgrounds. Whether you're jogging, cycling, or just strolling, the foreshore is immaculately maintained.\n​A perfect blend of relaxed beach life, great food, and unique views. Don't hesitate—Brighton-Le-Sands is a must-visit!",

Well, its good for nature photography, swimming, snorkelling i suppose, jogging absolutely,  relaxing, dating particularly, many more..

I went early morning at 5 , so no problem.\n\nUpdate... well it's sad that we cannot walk on the grasslands, where we can see great view of beach and the sunrise.

The inviting atmosphere of the beach was hard to resist, so I ended up swimming in the waves, enjoying the refreshing embrace of the ocean. The water was invigorating, making it an ideal day for a swim. After some fun in the surf, I took a nice, short coastal walk along the scenic path that offers stunning views of the coastline. The tranquil sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks were incredibly soothing. Additionally, I discovered a rock pool that was pleasingly clean and perfect for a quick dip. It was a delightful way to relax and connect with nature.\nAnother highlight was the well-maintained facilities at the beach. The toilets and showers were in great condition, providing a sense of comfort and convenience for visitors. Overall, my day at North Curl Curl Beach was a refreshing escape from the daily grind, and I left feeling rejuvenated. I will definitely plan to come back again next time! Whether you're looking to swim, walk, or simply enjoy the sun, North Curl Curl has something wonderful to offer for everyone. Highly recommended!",

Step inside and you are met with salt air through open windows, boards stacked neatly in the corner and volunteers in red and yellow drifting through between patrols. The upstairs room looks straight out to the bay, which makes it an easy place to catch your breath after a swim or to meet friends before sunset. Drinks are fairly priced, the food menu sticks to comforting classics, and staff keep things moving even when the beach is heaving. Grab a table by the balcony if you can. Watching the water change colour while a southerly rolls in is reason enough to linger for a second round.\n\nWhat stands out most is how welcoming and capable the lifesaving team feels. Patrols set the flags early, shift them as the banks move and happily explain conditions to anyone who asks. On busy afternoons you see them checking on kids with foamies near the shorebreak, offering advice without the lecture. That quiet competence gives real confidence if you are swimming with visitors or little ones. Sundays bring families in for Nippers, the change rooms are tidy, and the whole place has a grounded, local energy that is hard to fake. Training information is easy to find for anyone thinking about a Bronze Medallion, and there is always a fundraising raffle or two helping keep gear up to date.\n\nA couple of notes help. Bring photo ID to sign in as a guest, throw on dry clothes before heading upstairs, and arrive early on prime beach days when seats disappear quickly. If you are chasing a relaxed drink with a front row view and want to support the people who keep this stretch of coast safe, the club is a top pick. You leave with sandy feet, a full glass of sea air and a quiet appreciation for the crew who watch the flags.",

Step off the Corso, cross the promenade and you are at the heart of it all: red and yellow flags planted in neat lines, rescue boards stacked by the shed, radios clicking while patrols scan the banks. The clubhouse itself sits right on the sand with a front row view, so you feel part of the action even before you swim. Volunteers are welcoming and practical. Ask about the rips and you will get a clear read of the conditions, not a lecture, which is priceless if you are new to the beach or bringing visitors.\n\nIn the water the flagged zone is where the day stays easy. Sandbars move around here, so the patrol shifts the flags to the safest pocket and keeps everyone looped in with calm calls from the tower. Small days bring a playful shorebreak that is perfect for body surfing. When the swell stands up, confident swimmers still have fun under watchful eyes while families often wander south toward Fairy Bower and Shelly for gentler laps and good snorkel prospects. On weekends you will often catch Nippers running relays and foam boards across the sand, a reminder that this club is as much about teaching ocean sense as it is about rescues. IRB drills and board training add a bit of theatre without getting in the way.\n\nOutside the flags, the simple comforts are covered. Showers and taps line the promenade, change rooms are close, and a short stroll puts you among cafés for a post swim flat white. If the clubhouse is open to guests, bring photo ID and throw on a dry shirt before heading upstairs, the balcony outlook is hard to beat. The ferry makes arrival stress free and the walk from the wharf takes minutes. Early mornings give you soft light and space, late afternoons turn the bay to gold. Pack a hat, water and reef safe sunscreen, thank a lifesaver on the way out, and you will understand why this stretch of sand feels so well looked after.",

Step off the Corso, cross the promenade and you are at the heart of it all: red and yellow flags planted in neat lines, rescue boards stacked by the shed, radios clicking while patrols scan the banks. The clubhouse itself sits right on the sand with a front row view, so you feel part of the action even before you swim. Volunteers are welcoming and practical. Ask about the rips and you will get a clear read of the conditions, not a lecture, which is priceless if you are new to the beach or bringing visitors.\n\nIn the water the flagged zone is where the day stays easy. Sandbars move around here, so the patrol shifts the flags to the safest pocket and keeps everyone looped in with calm calls from the tower. Small days bring a playful shorebreak that is perfect for body surfing. When the swell stands up, confident swimmers still have fun under watchful eyes while families often wander south toward Fairy Bower and Shelly for gentler laps and good snorkel prospects. On weekends you will often catch Nippers running relays and foam boards across the sand, a reminder that this club is as much about teaching ocean sense as it is about rescues. IRB drills and board training add a bit of theatre without getting in the way.\n\nOutside the flags, the simple comforts are covered. Showers and taps line the promenade, change rooms are close, and a short stroll puts you among cafés for a post swim flat white. If the clubhouse is open to guests, bring photo ID and throw on a dry shirt before heading upstairs, the balcony outlook is hard to beat. The ferry makes arrival stress free and the walk from the wharf takes minutes. Early mornings give you soft light and space, late afternoons turn the bay to gold. Pack a hat, water and reef safe sunscreen, thank a lifesaver on the way out, and you will understand why this stretch of sand feels so well looked after.",

The only real positive is the park’s proximity to the metro station.\n\nWe were allocated a caravan site directly beside an active construction zone and toilets that were out of order, with no warning given at check-in. The construction involved constant jackhammering, drilling, and heavy machinery operating from 6am through to 5pm. The noise was relentless, extremely loud, and completely unsuitable for anyone working remotely or travelling with children. I work remotely and homeschool my children, and the jackhammer noise made it impossible to hold work calls, concentrate, or complete online schooling. The Wi-Fi was also virtually nonexistent, compounding the disruption.\n\nI went to reception first thing in the morning to politely request a move to a quieter site. Although the receptionist was superficially polite, she was unwilling to help in any meaningful way. She refused to check availability on the system, would not contact her supervisor, and insisted I return later—despite me explaining that I had an imminent conference call and that the jackhammering had already begun. Her tone and attitude made it clear that our situation was not a priority.\n\nAs a direct result of being left beside an active jackhammer construction site, I was forced to cancel my conference call and lost income for the day, and my children were unable to attend their online tutoring. When I returned later to speak with the supervisor, her attitude was appalling. There was no greeting, no apology, and no acknowledgement of the impact of placing paying guests next to loud jackhammer construction. When I explained the disruption and financial losses incurred, she responded by abruptly flinging a site map across the counter and turning back to her computer screen, refusing to engage further or even make eye contact.\n\nThe same dismissive behaviour continued when I raised safety concerns about the showers, which fluctuated between dangerously hot and freezing cold. A receptionist repeatedly stated “there’s no issues” in a blunt, confrontational manner, showing zero concern even after I explained that my children had nearly been scalded.\n\nOverall, the staff—particularly the supervisor—displayed a complete lack of professionalism, empathy, or customer care. Being placed next to constant jackhammer noise without warning, combined with rude staff and poor maintenance, made our stay unnecessarily stressful.\n\nAside from the convenient location, this park is grossly overpriced. It appears the owner relies solely on location while tolerating unacceptable service standards and major disruptions to guests.",

We arrived and set up our caravan next to a toilet block which was closed for repairs and was woken up the next day by the sound of a kango which went on all day so we asked to be moved which wasn’t straight forward. I don’t know why I was put on this spot in the first place as there was plenty of spaces available. The tv room was dirty and like a sauna with the drinks machine making so much noise it was impossible to hear the tv and I noticed there were no smoke alarms in there on a couple of occasions I witnessed people smoking in the tv room and showers.The showers were hit  and miss but mainly cold even though they had plumbers there working on them.. All in in all good location for the train but way over priced for what it is.",

Kylie - Park Manager, is singlehandedly the most hard-working manager I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Kylie's commitment to bettering the park and ensuring guest satisfaction is unparalleled and impressive. Her work ethic goes above and beyond what is expected, and she is an absolute delight to deal with and all of my family members look forward to interactions with Kylie on a daily basis. We have also stayed perviously at Ingenia - Avina (Vineyard), and by far Sydney Hills is superior in every aspect of the park.

Kylie's commitment to bettering the park and ensuring guest satisfaction is unparalleled and impressive. Her work ethic goes above and beyond what is expected, and she is an absolute delight to deal with and all of my family members look forward to interactions with Kylie on a daily basis. We have also stayed perviously at Ingenia - Avina (Vineyard), and by far Sydney Hills is superior in every aspect of the park. On behalf of myself and family I thank all staff for providing a welcoming, safe and happy environment.",

However, upon closer inspection, there were several cleanliness issues. The windows were dirty, with visible mould on and around the window sills. Most surfaces were covered in dust, as though they hadn’t been properly cleaned in some time. The bathroom had mould on the ceiling and around the toilet, and the shower temperature was extremely inconsistent—constantly switching between hot and ice cold with no stable temperature.\n\nIn the dining area, the sliding door was dirty with debris built up along the bottom, and there was an old, unpleasant smell. When we opened the cupboard to get the broom, there was a very strong and disturbing odour, as though something had died inside.\n\nI raised these concerns with reception while we went out for a short time. The receptionist was very kind and helpful and notified the cleaning staff. However, when we returned, all the windows had been shut (I had intentionally left them open), and the mould was still present. I tested it with a baby wipe, and it came off very easily, indicating it had not been properly cleaned.\n\nWhen I returned to reception to explain this, the cleaner was present. After showing them the dirty wipe and explaining that the mould had not been removed, the cleaner responded rudely and arrogantly, stating she had sprayed everything with bleach and shut the windows because dust was blowing in. I explained that dust does not cause mould and that I had taken photos before we left, which showed no change. She said she would come to the room so I could show her, which I did, but her attitude remained rude throughout the interaction.\n\nWe were also told to avoid the pool as its always having maitence done but never fixed (was green when we stay)\n\nThe room also had a lot of damage around, paint peeling from rail, slippery patio when it rained, paint peeling off wall, etc\n\nWe were extremely disappointed by both the cleanliness and the response, especially considering the price we paid and the fact that we had two young children staying in the room. The situation left us feeling upset, frustrated, and seriously considering leaving early.",

There were leaves strewn about near the entrance to the bathroom (which we swept on our own). The ensuite itself was showing its age with worn out fixtures, crumbling beams, and spider webs and dead insects stuck to the ceiling (a little cleaning with detergent could have prevented this).  The waste water drain was completely covered with leaf debris.  The grass next to our site had not been mowed for quite some time and was now full of weeds.  The access roads inside the park are quite narrow -- important when you're driving a 26ft motorhome. Unlike other Ingenia locations, park amenities for visitors are scarce -- one camp kitchen and a non-heated swimming pool.\nWe have really enjoyed our stays at other Ingenia RV parks such as Kingscliff and Bonny Hills.  Sadly, Sydney Hills was a huge disappointment. We will recommend our friends and family to avoid this location.",

Apparently that’s just how their system works. Other than that, everything was amazing.\n\nThere’s a great local pub perfect for family dinners, and they even do buffets (we sadly missed it this time). There’s plenty for the kids the bouncing pillow was a huge hit and they practically lived on it. You can also rent bikes to ride together, and the park has plenty of space for caravans.\nWe stayed in a playground house, which was perfect for keeping an eye on the kids while cooking or relaxing.\n\nThey’ve got electric BBQs that work well, plus the ones that come with the accommodation, though we couldn’t quite figure those out, the public one still did the job!\n\nOverall, an easy 10/10.

There were so many planes up until the late afternoon about 6pm, so it was quite noisy on the deck.\n- At night still, you can still clearly hear traffic/main road sounds from tent\n- The tent is weathered and tired-looking\n- The tent strongly smelled like wet umbrella which is understandable being out against the elements for ages. You need to try ventilate as much as you can. The tent had mould, dust and webs along ceiling.\n- Surfaces along bedhead, bedside tables, light shades needed wiping from dust\n- Nowhere on site mentioned what type of cutlery would be provided  or not etc. Didn't know a microwave was provided. There was a kettle and toaster provided. I couldnt find, but there was no plates, no cutlery, any BBQ cooking utensils, dishwashing sponge/liquid, and no tissues. There was however 2 wine glasses, 3 mugs and 2 glass cups provided, with some tea/coffee + 1 milk. If you go, please bring those items to eat/clean with.\n- Had a mouse in the tent which... freaked us out. Guess that's what you get #nature\n\nOverall, it was OK the stay. Although you may feel physically you're out of Sydney being in the national park, the noise of traffic and planes made that impossible to completely take you there. You are literally next to the caravan park so just bear in mind you wont be secluded completely, you're pretty close to other people.  The tent needs a bit of a refurbishment and work and airing.\nIf you can, bring some mosquito repellent or coils as there is quite a number around or be mindful to close the tent net. And try not leave food scraps in bin outside next to BBQ as there was a possum that ransacked through it at night keeping us up and climbing on our tent. This review is trying to neutral and observant, if you decide to go just keep these pointer in mind for the visit.",

The powered  camp site next door was brighter and had a much nicer outlook. Perfect to pitch our tent. Had we brought it.\n\nThere was large mouldy patches on the tent and tears in the zips leaving large holes for any number of creepy crawlies to join us.\n\nWe were harassed by a family of brush turkeys who seemed far too comfortable for our liking and even hoped on the table to join us for dinner.\n\nDuring he early evening we noticed a family of (bush) rats also making themselves at home near the large deck while we enjoyed our evening wine. Fair enough, we are in the bush. Can deal with wildlife...outside... I draw the line at the rats being inside nibbling on the soap left next to the sink and causing no end of disturbance. I would have happily, at this point relocated to the car to sleep had it not been for the warmth of the tent. THis was a positive as was the large single fridge inside and tv that we used to block out the road, air and rat noise.\n\nAt one point my husband and I discussed driving home it was that ridiculous.\n\nGiven the amount of weekends that are booked out for the coming year, I suggest some serious maintenance is done as it is certainly not the experience we were expecting. If you have a booking, please be aware it may not be as glamourous as the images... it was more Camping than Glamping\n\nWould never recommend or stay again and will be asking for a refund at this point.",

Had I known this i would not have booked this place.\n\nThe one she booked by accident is miles from anything I paid $1500 for a trip that was awful, no amenities, no room service and I had to clean my own dishes or else they would charge.

Pool was filthy, sauna is broken i regret booking this place.\n\nI will NOT be back!!",

The kitchen was disgusting, and even the ensuite area was full of dust and cobwebs.\n\nThere’s not much for kids to do besides the pool, which thankfully was clean and nice. However, there were unsupervised children in the pool and some very rude older guests.\n\nThe road leading in is rough and not well maintained.\nLaundry costs $6 per wash and $6 per dryer, but the dryer didn’t even dry the clothes properly.\n\nOverall, we wish we had read the reviews before booking.

Unlike others, this one offers great amenities including hot and cold showers (with a 5-minute timer), BBQ facilities, and a designated area for washing dishes.\n\nThe park is divided into two sections: a day-use area and a campground. Day-use entry is $8, while camping costs $39 per night for up to 3 people. A park ranger usually comes around 4:30 PM to check bookings, so make sure yours is confirmed.\n\nImportant to know: The park gate closes at 6 PM. To enter after that time, you'll need the access code provided in your booking confirmation—don’t forget it!\n\nOne thing to note: this is one of the few parks where collecting fallen wood for fires is not allowed. Be sure to bring your own firewood if you plan on using the fire pit.\n\nThere’s plenty of space to spread out, and you'll likely spot lots of kangaroos roaming around. Overall, it’s a great camping spot—and I’ll definitely be back!",

Mens restroom did smell funky, but shower pressure was good. Canteen prices are reasonable and park is mediocre. Roads are perfect for biking around the area. Walking distance from the park to the shops.",

We needed to book way before though so everyone would be able to get a booking. Were about 10 families. We booked the kitchen and dining area which had enough essentials for storing our foods and cooking. The dining had enough seating and tables for our group, though at night the dining lights didn't work. It wasn't that a big inconvenience though.\n\nThe campground itself had more than enough space not just for our group but for other families too to camp out. It was well-equipped with a barbecue and campfire pits. There's also trees that served as shade. It was our first time camping as a small family and we couldn't be happier of the experience. Our toddler was so happy roaming around with friends but we still felt that he was safe as the roads weren't too wide inside the campground and there were barriers to every part.\n\nRestrooms were just enough for the place's capacity. I like the idea of timed hot water. Win win for both the guests and the environment!\n\nWe also loved the opportunity to hike by the lake. It was accessible if you're not used to hiking like our family and with little ones with you. The view going and by the lake was stunning!\n\nIt was a wonderful experience. We will surely be back as a family. For a very minimal price, it was surely worth it! Highly recommended!",

On the second occasion myself and others I was travelling with asked for room changes and we're advised there were no other rooms available. As it was 36° We then asked for a fan, it took about 5 hours and repeated asking for me to get one. Others still did not get one provided despite the hitel stating they were available and had to walk to kmart to purchase one themselves. The staff did not seem to overly care and just kept advising that either someone had looked and the air con worked or \"there's people looking\". It was not fixed in the 4 nights I stayed. When i used the bath and emptied it, it flooded the bathroom so had to let the water out bit by bit. There was an incident where the elevators power tripped and they ceased working. When we asked if we could use the fire stairs to get to our rooms, they said they didn't know where they were or if they could access them which was highly concerning should there be a fire. Amenities are ok with a small gym and pool. Dinners were nice and there is an adequate buffet breakfast. After the first night the sheets felt weird and like they were ill fitting, looked down and the bottom sheet only covered half the bed. Disappointingly this seems to be the standard the last few times I have stayed here.\nIt's a very good location (depsite hearing trains all night due to poor soundproofing) and convenient otherwise I think this place would have gone out of business by now.",

The bed was very uncomfortable and the end corners were raise up as if curled due to the sheets being ill-fitting. No additional pillows in the room, just the two on the bed itself. The cleaning service did not empty bins or restock tea/coffee across my 3 day 2 night stay.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was adequate with a modest selection hot hot foods, Bacon, chicken sasuage, scrambled eggs, hashbrown, baked beans and salted mushrooms. There is a small selection of cereals and pasties and toast. Machine coffee, tea, juices (apple, orange and pineapple) available as part of the buffet and Barista coffee for purchase through the bar.\n\nOverall it was not up to the same standard as previous visits based purely on the poor state of the room and no turn down service. I've stayed here a few times and hoping this was a once off poor experience as the location is great, near the train station and just a short work from work office, river and good food and shopping  precincts.",

This place is so family friendly and very impressed with facilities - they are not high end as it is a hostel however everything clean, simple and just made everything super convenient for our trip. We felt so comfortable during breakfast times with our preschooler because of the chill/unpretentious vibe.\n\nBathroom cleanliness however for our room was not great :/. It is the reason for not giving five stars, the issue was the black mould in nearly all the grout lines of the shower. I actually felt a bit upset when we got there the first night but my son loved sleeping in the bunk bed and we didn't know if we could get another room with bunk bed. We were at the end of the hall on the first level, and opposite us was a communal bathroom that was cleaner than ours with no mould. I mention this as I hope YHA take this on board to fix this issue/maybe need to regrout that particular shower? The bed was comfy and temperature was good otherwise. Shower pressure was also good.\n\nI would like to thank the staff for making our stay sooo wonderful too  The music on the rooftop with dinner and the view..was a highlight of our trip. Would love to return to YHA Harbour if hopefully we can have a cleaner bathroom next time!",

The property itself is beautiful and offers useful facilities such as a shared kitchen, laundry room, and the option to store your luggage at reception if your room isn’t ready for check-in.\n\nThe room is small, but functional and cosy. I liked it! The shower is great as well; I just want to mention that due to the design of the shower screen, someone from outside can see the silhouette of the person showering. It didn’t bother me, but I think it’s worth noting for other guests. I also missed having basic utensils like plates and cutlery in the room, which would have made simple meals much easier.\n\nRegarding the staff, my experience was mixed — some team members were very attentive, while others were not as friendly or helpful.\n\nA few aspects, however, were disappointing. Breakfast was one of the weakest I’ve had in a hotel, with very few options and only sachet coffee available, with no machine or anything more substantial. The room cleanliness also fell short — the shower had visible marks and the floor clearly hadn’t been vacuumed.\n\nThe biggest downside for me was the lack of housekeeping throughout the entire stay. I understand it may be part of an eco-friendly policy, but I believe there are other ways to support the environment without compromising guest comfort. I asked at reception if it would be possible to have at least the towels changed or the bins emptied; they told me yes, but it never happened.\n\nOverall, unfortunately, it’s not a hotel I would return to anytime soon.",

The showers have transparent glass on two sides that basically spotlights the person having a shower and gives no privacy whatsover.  The attention to detail was also lacking with the four of us given no extra toilet rolls for the three nights, and only two cups and one spoon across the two rooms (with two sticks of instant coffee and two stick of sugar) for a three night stay .  Basically you felt like you had to go hassle the reception staff for everything.  Also as room service is only two days a week, you end up using a wet towel and wet floor mat the whole time... Washing/drying is $8 ($4 for members).  The parking is $60 a day at a car park about 200m away.  I was able to find a car space so that was good.\n\nThere are three 15min parking spaces In front of the hotel for setting down your luggage and check-in.  Westfield shopping centre is just behind and has a lot of food options nearby.\n\nThis is a great option if your travelling alone, but if you're travelling as a family, look elsewhere.\n\nThey also don't do twin-bedding so one king size and if you're sleeping you have to hurdle over the other person.\n\nOn a positive side, the block out blinds are amazing and kept the sun out and it's close to good public transport options.",

Leo at reception was a massive help in assisting us with extending our stay, thanks Leo!! The staff are all so helpful and friendly, shoutout to Lune and Henry as well.\n\nRooms:\nFirst we stayed in a 6-bed dorm which was good, your typical dorm room. Bottom bunks have curtains, top bunks have access to the tops of the lockers to set your things, and there is a fan and mini fridge. We extended our stay and moved to a private + ensuite. The room was great, with a fan, mini fridge, and TV. We extended again and moved to a private with no ensuite, which still had the fan, fridge, and TV.\n\nBathrooms:\nShowers and bathrooms are often busy but there are lots around the hostel, so something will usually be available. With high traffic they can sometimes get dirty, as with most hostels. The staff are visibly working hard to clean every day, and they stay on top of it. Towels are provided!\n\nKitchen:\nBreakfast is provided every day from 8am to 10am (toast, peanut butter, jam, marmalade, butter, vegemite, and some cereal options with milk), and dinner is provided on Tues/Thurs/Sat at 8pm. Dinner rotates between pasta, rice/veggies, and BBQ. Thank you to Dave for cooking!\n\nThe kitchen is closed every day at 10am for about an hour so staff can clean, so be aware when you’re planning breakfast.\n\nStaff are very good and making sure people leave the courtyard by 10pm so it’s quiet near the rooms. People usually move to the TV room or front porch to hang out past 10.\n\nThey offer daily activities on their WhatsApp channel, such as city walks, picnics, pub trivia, and basketball at a local outdoor court.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again!",

I slept on the top bunk bed and unfortunately had no power plug to charge my stuff. Couldn't find lockers in the room, but also didn't look for long after the first night before booking another place to stay. There were large metal drawers underneath the bottom bunk bed which I believe were supposed to hold out stuff, but I wouldn't keep my clothes or bags there as it was very rusty. Aircon worked fine and temperature was pleasant. There are no alternative lighting to the ceiling lights so at night if people are asleep you either use your phone (at this point with no batteries) or try your luck in the dark. That was the ok part, and now comes the not as good one.\nI had trouble checking (11pm), the staff took a few 20 mins to fix the issue and after asking me the same questions 6-7 times (as they didn't know what to do) they had to ask another staff for help. The second person just wanted to enjoy the party next door (mee too!). Unfortunately bathrooms were dirty or lacked toilet paper on the night and morning I was there. I understand I didn't give the hostel much opportunity to change my mind before fleeing the place, but my friends continued there and didn't have much positive points to share. I understand the vibe of a party hostel is to just enjoy and relax and it is my mistake too for trying, but no toilet paper at 8am and the black mold and pee smell in the showers were a bit much for my hostel vibes. Cleanliness is the bare minimum, I believe. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend. But the linked bar next-door is very good.",

Bathrooms and showers were clean and always had hot water. A lot of social areas in the hostel, but it was very busy and the kitchen area was always packed. Breakfast was also very busy at 7:30am, but they did have gluten free bread and cereal which was excellent!",

Super friendly, actually helpful, and they kept fixing the eternal problems with washers and dryers like they were running a mini superhero team. Seriously, they smile while doing laundry maintenance. That deserves a medal.\n\nBreakfast is complimentary in the most literal sense. Cereal or a sandwich with chocolate spread or jam. Coffee and tea pretending to be enough to wake you up. It will not blow your mind, but it will keep you alive.\n\nIf you need a bed in the center of Sydney and you are traveling on a budget, this place is perfect.

And props to the housekeeping team, its a thankless jobs but you guys look like you actually enjoy it and the cleanliness and team camaraderie didn't go amiss. (Sorry don't know names) Shout out to Magna too the in house magician with a paint brush.\nThe place has character and your not served my robots or zombies. Also unlike Azzuro Darling Harbour this place isn't falling apart and with foul smelling drains. Breakfast is cheap and cheerful, bed frames squeaky but beds nice and comfy, ample storage space in locker and decent showers designed in a way that doesn't flood the entire floor after only a few uses, unlike many other hostel I stayed in. Room always felt fresh and air con worked fine. Great central location a minutes walk from Central Station and Chinatown. With World Square Coles and Market City eateries and shops close by. And the light rail line running parallel to hostel. Would definitely recommend for short or medium term stays on a budget. :) Will stay again if I return to Sydney. Keep up the good work!",

Designed primarily for caravans , campervans and boats. It  boasts enough space to cater for all these. I've been there 4 times recently with my mobile home and never had a problem getting a parking space. If your staying for a night or more get stocked up with supplies because other than a mobile coffee van there is nothing else. There are rudimentary toilets . I think around 4 to 6. Using them is akin to using the toilets on a plane; always queues , unisex and void of any home comforts. If you use your imagination and pretend you are actually going on a plane trip to an exotic location its helps deal with it better . Oh, and be nice to your neighbours too. You never know when you'll need them. 😉🤣 I've already helped a guy jump start their car, such is the infectious sense of community there.\n.\nFinally , the views come straight from a postcard of Wales or Scotland or Norway. Truly stunning and act as a glorious buffer to the sound of traffic from the M1 motorway .\nThus far this place has not been commercialised.  Be greatful for small miracles. Let's hope that and it's charm stays preserved.",

The floor is never too slippery and there is just enough light but the sun never comes in. It does get hot in summer so be prepared to sweat. The facilities also include change rooms (which are always clean) with toilets and free showers.\n\nThey have a cold water tap on the court and I've heard their gym is also very good quality. The playground looks great for children of all ages and has plenty of shade also.\n\nStaff are super friendly also. One of the best sport courts in the city and 5m walk from wynyard. Highly recommended",

This place has it all that 4 hours parking almost doesn’t seem enough.\n\nThey accept fitness passport so great value for anyone already with that membership.\n\nThere is also a canteen there with a wide selection of food. Can’t remember them all but there are pies, sandwiches, fried seafood and chips, muffins, donuts, ice cream and most importantly, coffee.   If there’s a swimming class on expect a long wait but there’s vending machines right next to them if you need a quick grab and go.\n\nOutdoor parking is free and plentiful. It seems small cause it’s always packed but whenever we go and do a round we always seem to find a spot within a couple of minutes.\n\nRyde Aquatic and Sydney Olympic Aquatic are by far the two best pools in the area and a must visit.",

Yesterday, Sunday, was about half hour wait. A lot of parents also have no common sense that there are people waiting,  and they leave their kids there forever in the shower while adults who need to shower and go back to work get stuck waiting. Seems like parents use the shower as day care facilities, to leave their kids there while they go out for a coffee or something. I dont know what they're doing, but they shouldn't let their kids there in the shower forever completely oblivious of other people waiting.",

The most impressive part was the assessment.  Not only that the kids are trained but the assessment is so detailed that they make sure that kids are really ready for the next level. My daughter has been to many other swimming schools but finally we have got the best for her. Kudos to the team and thankyou.",

I had to duck, weave and step over people in order to put back the heavy plates I was using (in returning my weights I am following their gym policy and etiquette by not leaving heavy weights on equipment I’ve used). I felt awkward and you could tell the people in the class did too, but that was where they were instructed to train so they couldn’t move. My husband noticed this all happening and approached her kindly to let her know how dangerous this was for both myself and the people in the class. She didn’t care for his concern and was really abrasive in her response. Ever since, she has relentlessly targeted us. Other people in the gym can have no towel and she does nothing, however if my husband has no towel she will speak to him and tell him she’ll kick him out next time. On one occasion, my husband walked in to the gym in his slides and sat down in the bags area to change his shoes. She kicked him out the door to change his shoes, yet on the same day a man was running in and out of the gym from the pool dripping wet with no shoes on at all.. she did nothing. This morning we were doing a quick warmup in the open area and she approached us to tell us we had to move within 20 minutes because a class was starting. We weren’t going to stand there for 20 minutes anyway. Another person was working out in the same area and wasn’t told to move. If the people in the class in the morning, which is run by another trainer, are near equipment that I’m using he will move them and is so respectful. He doesn’t prioritise the people in the class just because they’re in his class, he cares about everybody who is paying to use the space. This lady only cares about people in her class and has ruined our gym experience here. We feel awkward and targeted when she is around. I fear we’ll need to look for a new gym, which is disappointing after finding somewhere to train that we really loved.",

I'm sure it would be fine if kids are older.\n\nEdit: appreciate they've added some private showers but there's still no where to lay your baby to change them. It would be helpful to have some change tables in the family area, even if they're not in a cubicle. You can't change a baby on a wet floor.",

We started going to Redleaf Pool back in the early 1990's, when we lived there n Darlinghurst, as it was better than Bondi Beach as there was hardly any crowds - even on days with over 30° heat.\nMy kids learnt to swim here. It was great to teach them water safety in open water, as opposed to a swimming pool, where we had things like waves from the boats, currents, seaweed and fish around.\nWe moved to Auburn after my eldest started school, but would make the trip almost every single weekend, and holidays, just so the kids could swim in a safe environment, where we could watch them easily, and not like se them in a crowd.\nI still swim here whenever it is possible. It's a great place for families, and you don't have the fear of losing sight of your children in a big crowd.\nI highly recommend Murray Rose Pool for families with young children.",

The enclosure provides a swimming area of approximately 90m x 60m. The kiosk provides shaded seating and a spectacular outlook across Double Bay. No dog's allowed or fishing!Murray Rose Pool, Double Bay: A Harbourside Gem\n​Murray Rose Pool (formerly known as Redleaf Pool) is one of Sydney’s most picturesque harbourside swimming enclosures. Located in Double Bay’s exclusive Blackburn Cove, it offers a refreshing and uniquely Sydney swimming experience that feels a world away from the busy city.\n​✨ The Best Features\n​Stunning Harbourside Setting: The pool's biggest draw is its location right on Sydney Harbour. Swimmers are treated to gorgeous views of moored yachts, boats sailing past, and the sparkling water of Double Bay. The tranquil scenery makes it a perfect escape.\n​Safe Tidal Enclosure: This is less a traditional concrete pool and more a large, shark-net enclosed section of the harbour. It offers a safe swimming area of approximately 90m x 60m, ideal for casual dips and a different kind of \"lap\" swimming.\n​Floating Pontoons: A favourite feature for all ages! Two large floating pontoons sit within the enclosure, providing perfect spots for sunbathing, diving in, or simply relaxing and enjoying the gentle rocking of the water.\n​Boardwalk and Gardens: A scenic wrap-around boardwalk offers a lovely stroll and great vantage points for photos. Access is via the beautiful Blackburn Gardens, making the journey down to the water a pleasant experience in itself.\n​🏖️ Visitor Experience\n​Murray Rose Pool provides a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere.\n​Amenities: Basic but essential facilities are provided, including change rooms, public toilets, and showers.\n​Kiosk: There is an on-site kiosk, often located at the top of the stairs or adjacent to the enclosure, which offers coffee, snacks, and shaded seating with spectacular views over the pool and bay.\n​Beach Access: The pool adjoins a small strip of sand, Seven Shillings Beach, which is great for sunbathers and families. There are also grassy slopes nearby (part of Blackburn Gardens) with some shady spots.\n​Accessibility Note: Visitors should be aware that the pool is accessed by a series of stairs or winding paths through the gardens, and the boardwalk itself may be challenging for those with limited mobility as dedicated accessibility features like ramps are minimal.\n​The Murray Rose Pool is a must-visit for anyone looking for a unique, serene, and quintessentially Sydney swimming spot. While it lacks the defined lanes and lifeguards of an Olympic pool (swimming is at your own risk), its breathtaking views and charming atmosphere more than make up for it. It’s perfect for a lazy summer afternoon, a safe swim for the kids, or a tranquil spot to read and sip a coffee.",

The private rooms, which allow you to have the privacy that you crave, offering you an infrared sauna with a shower and a cold bath in one room, is exceptional. The layout is rather nice allowing you if you feel like it to sauna in the nude, as you would not normally be able to do this in another facility where there are too many common spaces. I would highly recommend you try this business. I hope more like it pop up. I have not yet used the float tank, but that’s my next ambition. The service offered by Byron and his other team members is also very welcoming and that can sometimes be the difference as some other places can be a little bit too cool for school and you don’t necessarily feel like you belong. There is no pretense with this business, which is what I like.",

The staff Byron who greeted me on the day was super friendly and welcoming, he spent the time talking me through the experience and the procedure in great detail. The facility is really nice setup and clean. There's shower facility onsite with washing gel and ear buds to stop water getting in. The only surprise was that the pump came up during my session but overall great session.",

I suffer from insomnia and find the infrared sauna to put my body into a state of relaxing and subside my anxiety. Byron who works at reception is so lovely and the team have done an amazing job to make you feel comfortable and the experience relaxing! All the equipment is new using high-tech red light therapy and the place is very clean! I recommend this place if you want a more personal and quiet environment that isn’t crowded with customers coming in and out. 🙏🏻They provide you with fresh towels, high quality hair care and body wash, books to read and essential oils and water to make the experience even better!",

Unfortunately, I feel that the service I received was not worth the price. I had requested a deep tissue massage, but instead, I got the GENTLEST massage I've ever experienced and I am a regular massage spa goer. It felt like the masseur was just applying oil to my back. I asked twice, with a significant gap in between, for the massage to be firmer, but there was no change. She predominantly used her palms, and the pressure was lacking. The back scrub consisted of applying soap and a hot towel, which was quite underwhelming. The facial was decent compared to the massage and back scrub. Overall, I won't be returning, and I can't recommend this spa. 😢\n\nGiving it 2 stars for the effort and the facial.",

Within the next half hour my watch had been found for me & returned to my room, meaning my ‘senior moment’ didn’t turn into permanent loss. 😀👍🏻",

A lot of focus was put on feet though which was very strange.\n\nThe microwaves outside the room with all the noise of lunch was not relaxing.\n\nWe asked to have a shower at the end and the staff were surprised about this. We were given a robe but no fresh towel so had to use the one which had covered our skin which was covered in oil. I found the bathroom after and discovered there were lots of showers we could have used and fresh towels.\n\nWe had to ask to pay as staff at counter didn’t seem to know we had finished a treatment. I asked for tea and was given water post treatment. I would have expected better service for the price.",

My experience for my booking last Thursday was shockingly terrible, and will be my last at The Rocks.\n\nI made a booking to treat myself for 5:30pm Thurs 10th July 2025 - Intense Radiance Facial and a remedial (?) massage. I've had a crazy few months and this was my downtime before another project run.\n\n- I received a missed call on 7 July with no Voicemail or SMS so I assume it's a cold call. It's also courtesy to send a follow up written communication normally but I didn't receive one.\n\n- the same number called again 9 July so I answer (screenshot of call history). Endota The Rocks receptionist asked me to come earlier but didn't specify what time. I let them know I'm driving up from Wollongong and 5:15pm is the earliest I could do, instead of 5:30pm. Receptionist pushed for 4:30pm and I compromised for 5pm which caused complications on my end with traffic and another errand I had to do after the meeting, hoping to be relaxed.\n\n- the same receptionist calls at 4:53pm on the day of my booking whilst I'm parking underground in the nearby carpark to make sure I'm on time for a 5pm appt. I felt rushed. There was no 'thank you, how are you, see you soon'.\n\nI arrive at the spa 4:57pm, the brunette receptionist didn't greet with 'hi, how are you etc' it was an abrupt 'I'll take you downstairs '. Which made no sense to me as I've never been there before, and I let her know that. The whole experience was just odd with so many things went wrong and I definitely didn't feel taken care of.\n\nI felt very rushed, and I didn't feel settled in at any part of this. Amelia was a lovely therapist who tried her best but the receptionist was vacuuming in the last 20mins of my massage.\n\nAfter my massage, the receptionist told me there's no showers available because I didn't tell her I needed one earlier (I didn't know I had to, there was no induction), and my entire body was slathered with thick body oil, including the soles of my feet and would have been a slipping hazard on the wooden floors of the massage room.\n\nMy hair was extremely oily and it made me feel very ick at how thick it was. In my initial phone call to this receptionist, I had let her know it's my first time, and I told her again when she rushed me downstairs to be waiting for 7mins with no one attending to me.\n\nIf I knew this was what to expect, I wouldn't have come here, nor would I have been buying vouchers for so many team members in the past!\n\nI don't know if I had a bad luck of an experience, or this is the norm and regular customers have a lower standard, but there was nothing authentic nor relaxing here.\n\nI explained my feedback to Amelia after the massage. She said she would notify the manager and it's been more than a week and I haven't heard anything back.\n\nAmelia farewelled me and said the exit door is to the left.\n\nThe receptionist followed me up the stairs, didn't even ask how my massage was, but called out to me as I was about to leave 'you need to pay!'\nIt was so rude, so uncomfortable, and degrading. Someone with her lack of care shouldn't be in the front facing role.\n\nI hadn't heard anything back from management so I'll send them a request through email however at this stage, Endota spa is removed from our rewards list in the company.\n\nThis was absolutely careless and I truly hope no one else goes through this. I paid almost $400 for this which is alot more than I've ever paid at my usual. Whilst the facial was good, I would have definitely preferred Nature's Energy bathhouse over this any day.",

From the moment I was greeted I felt an instant calm in my mind & body like I’d crossed over some threshold keeping the caps at bay behind me as I’m shown through the doors along a beautifully & tastefully decorated corridor past a very practical wet towel shoot, led further past a comfy couch in a tranquil zone & into the steamy haze of some Grecian oasis that is the bathouse. This area is organised into seven stations that can be used randomly or as recommended in an order of hat best utilises contrast therapy. First a shower is required & unique to Natures energy there’s an abundance of exfoliating sea salt to scrub down the body ahead of expelling some serious sweat beads in the traditional sauna. I limit my saunas to ten mins but it was well sufficient for evicting those toxins. I then trepidatiously slid into the most tolerable ice bath I’ve ever encountered, which made me happy because I lasted longer than I had in ice baths elsewhere though I’m unsure of the actual temperature of the two baths installed here.\nOn to the mineral pool which isn’t vast in size comfortably fits maybe five or six people. I felt the temperature was perfect and 15 mins or so was completely invigorating. Then I showered, then steamed then infra red sauna, shower, dried off and did my last ten minutes standing in front of a medical grade Infra-red panel which I feel may have booted my immune system into a restorative state. Even well into the next day I’m feeling as light as a feather, my mood has lifted significantly.\nI had previously only been in unisex bathhouses. I wasn’t uncomfortable at any stage sharing  the space but it was quite a different experience to segregated venues.\nHonestly the most relaxing place I’ve been to and their ritual makes complete sense so it is incredibly helpful to post it on signage for us forgetful peeps.\nAnother pleasant surprise was the lux products all are invited to use in when showering. My hair was left feeling clean, soft & detangled - a major feat & largely only achieved from using good quality shampoo & conditioner. I highly recommend you attend Natures Energy Balmain Bathouse to experience tranquility in the midst of any chaos you maybe experiencing in life.\nAs good as a holiday, and feeling just as refreshed, still vibing two days on…an incredible experience.",

One of the biggest letdowns is that bombing—one of the most classic and exciting pool moves—is strictly not allowed. Without being able to do bombs, flips, or even just let loose a bit, the whole vibe feels way too controlled and boring. It’s hard to enjoy yourself when you’re constantly being told to stop doing anything remotely fun. If you’re hoping for a lively, carefree swim or to hang out with friends in a place that actually lets you enjoy the water, you’d be better off skipping Lambton Pool altogether. There are definitely better spots that don’t take all the fun out of swimming.",

Instead of letting them swim lengths of the biggest ocean pool in the Southern Hemisphere they make then swim 50 metres across the pool between concrete blocks down one end. This leaves the bulk of this 100 metre ocean pool for recreational swimmers to swim in any direction they want.\n\nIt’s also fully accessible with no steps between reserved accessible parking and the ramps into both the large pool and the wading pool (which is also a hundred metres long) with a soft sand entry on one side. With hand gliders cruising overhead, and waves crashing on three sides this is a beautiful pair of pools with plenty of amenity: concrete and wood benches spaced along the whole site, clean change rooms, outdoor showers, free off-street parking and lifeguards dispensing water-going wheelchairs to those who need them.",

Today I had a brain fart and turned up 30min late for the kids swimming lessons and right when all lessons end.  This was no problem tho as Indigo and the staff quickly came up with a plan.  Indi ended up staying back to teach both of my kids, two different levels, a private lesson at no extra charge! What an amazing place to swim.  Indigo is an incredible teacher, so great with the kids, constant laughter and fun while still teaching skills for life.  I can not say thank you enough to Arnold’s Swim Centre and highly recommend them if you’re looking for the best swim centre in Newcastle!",

They suggested this would last around 3-4 weeks while she adjusted. We returned one week before the class had ended to find her walking on the street by herself!! After the incident, it not only took Arnold’s a whole week to contact us (despite us trying to get in contact everyday until we heard from the owner) but they could not explain how this happened and why the instructor had let her go without any parent. We asked them to install a gate to prevent this happening to any other children but they refused. This situation could have ended much worse and I would hate for any other parent to have to experience it",

For those with young ones and perhaps caught out without a swim nappy, these are available for purchase at admission and are a requirement.  There are two pools and a walk-through fun zone for the young ones where they can get wet without being in the pools whilst staying undercover and out if the sun. Both pools, one a 25m and the other a 50m have shelter over a decent portion of each for shaded swimming (the shallow end of the 50m). The 25m pool is single depth all the way across - good for kids or those not willing to tread water. You can swim laps in the 50m or swim casually. Lifeguards are always present and vigilant. There are change rooms, sheltered areas with picnic tables and plenty of grassy area to stretch out and catch some shade. There is a small kiosk for all your hot chips, drinks, etc. The pools are kept sparkling clean and for all the reasons above, our family will keep coming back. Keep up the good work!",

The manager and another staff member was on the floor, putting equipment away, emptying bins, refilling wet wipes.\n\nEven the members attending were attentive and putting away equipment they used. The gym has a great vibe where everyone respects each other.\n\nI stopped to speak to the manager Vladimir, who was so pleasant and shared how impressed I was with the gym and its standard of cleanliness and visibly seeing the gym being taken care of during busying times around 5:30-7am.\nVladimir was so lovely, he even gave me a free towel for sharing my experience.\n\nMy gym at Moorebank could learn a lot from this place.

The toilets/showers were a little outdated but worked well and were always clean. We especially loved the huge camp kitchen which had everything in it that you would need. Even an air fryer! The adjoining TV room to the camp kitchen was an added bonus. Nice large room with board games, books, TV, comfortable sofas and tables and chairs. There was even an old school arcade machine which was free! Location is perfect.   Very close to the beautiful beach. The sunsets and sunrises were out of this world.",

It’s a high-demand location, so booking in advance is recommended. All the amenities were well-maintained and clean, which made the stay comfortable and hassle-free.

The stay was thoroughly enjoyable and exceeded our expectations. The local wildlife—particularly the ducks and possums—was a delightful highlight, leaving the children absolutely captivated.\n\nThe park’s facilities were excellent, with the splash park, swimming pool, and playground all conveniently located nearby. The beach was only a short walk from the opposite end of the park, providing a perfect balance of activities for families. We stayed on sites 508 and 509 alongside friends, which worked well, though we have already earmarked another site for our next visit as it offers generous shade and is situated very close to the beach.\n\nAlthough I had read some negative reviews prior to our trip, our own experience was entirely positive. The staff were welcoming and helpful, even going so far as to repair a pedal bike on the spot so we could enjoy riding it immediately.\n\nOverall, we found Swansea Lakeside Holiday Park to be a wonderful destination for families, and we look forward to returning in the future.",

Everyone we dealt with was friendly, helpful, and efficient, which made check-in and general questions easy. Parking is available at $20 per day and can be paid for through the app, which was very convenient.\n\nOur room was on the fifth floor and was very well designed and efficient. The bed was firm and comfortable, and the choice of one soft and one firm pillow was appreciated. The room included a small couch, table, fridge, and a well-thought-out bathroom. The bathroom door is multi-functional, closing in to create a shower enclosure or giving privacy when using the toilet. There were no issues with water leakage, drainage was excellent, and the shower pressure was fantastic.\n\nTemperature control was another strong point. Both the room and hotel were easy to keep cool with the air-conditioning, which was especially welcome given the extreme heat outside during our stay. Coming back to a cool room and a refreshing shower was a relief.\n\nBreakfast was fine and did the job. It’s a functional spread with cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, beans, toast, and the basics. The buffet coffee isn’t great, but there is a proper coffee machine at reception where you can purchase a better coffee, or alternatively there’s a lovely café about 300 metres down the road.\n\nOverall, this is a clean, well-kept hotel that’s thoughtfully laid out and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would happily stay here again.",

The room seems to have been refurbished, though overall it’s still a bit dated, but not in a bad way.\n\nWhat could be improved is the cleanliness. I noticed a small mold stain on the bed sheet. One of the small towels on the bathroom counter had a slight mark, and the large towel under the counter had some hair on it, so did the shower drain area. Considering the price of around $160 per night, I would expect a cleaner room.\n\nBreakfast is $20.",

Spent 3days here with another 13 friends as we booked all sites in Nov 2021🤣🤣 sounds crazy but it’s truely worthy! The site is clean; electric BBQ area is convenient for make breakfast; not to mention the millionaires view! We saw the amazing Milky Way at night. Toilet was not next to the camp site though, took around 2 min walking, but it’s clean. If has to point out one downside, no hot water supply, only cold shower available, which not really bother us in such a nice season. 2 min walking to the beach, where you could enjoy the sunrise if gets up early enough🤣 has hiking tracks along site as well, overall 5 star with no doubt!",

The hostel was very homey and the staff were beyond friendly and helpful. The check in was super easy (especially as we arrived late and reception isn’t 24hrs), the hostel isn’t too big so we found our room easily and the rooms were spacious with showers close by. The kitchen was big and fully equipped, with lots of space for all our stuff and it was cleaned every morning. The male receptionists were especially kind and helped us sort out an issue we had with our payment as we booked through an external company and showed us how to use the washer and dryer. Unfortunately there is only one toilet on the downstairs floor and two showers but later learnt there were more upstairs. It is a very friendly hostel and on our last night they hosted a free BBQ. They also are very happy do you to use the facilities once you have checked out—which is the best news for any backpacker! They are also very knowledgable on things to do and happy to help. We couldn’t recommend this stay more. If you’re looking for a low key, homey hostel YHA Newcastle Beach is the pick for you.",

I didn’t get an offer of the ‘smell’ preference, the music was too loud and had had big breaks between playing. There was a lot of clanking noise coming from the room next door.

Located right next to the sea, it offers a refreshing swimming experience with stunning coastal views. The water is usually calm and clear, making it perfect for families, casual swimmers, and anyone who wants to enjoy a peaceful swim without strong waves.\n\nThe pool area is well-maintained, with easy access from the beach and plenty of open space around it for relaxing, sunbathing, or enjoying a picnic. The sound of the waves crashing nearby adds to the peaceful atmosphere. Early mornings and late afternoons are especially scenic with the sunrise or sunset reflecting over the water.\n\nOverall, Towradgi Pool is a wonderful spot for a safe swim, beautiful ocean views, and a calming seaside experience. Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike.",

Showers are ok, some mould on the back wooden doors and you would be surprised but the shower water pressure is too high.  Why you might ask… there are no hot taps so the hot water is at a constant 45c so to cool the water temperature you have to increase the cold water pressure…. Very unusual.  The staff are very nice.  There are more permanent residents in lovely accommodation than there are campers so the park is very quiet.  Overall very nice park and I would stay again",

However when its flat its like you are swimming at a remote far away resort . The people you meet all say hello and you instantly feel a sense of community . Of course there are drawn backs . Its shallow so no diving , the stairs are quite mossy very dangerous and being a popular pool it can get very busy . These are minor drawbacks and nothing to deter you .",

The grounds are kept tidy, and the toilets and change rooms are clean and well-maintained. The added bonus? A patrolled beach is just nearby, which is perfect for a relaxing day by the sea.\n\nThere’s also plenty of parking and shaded areas with tables and benches, making it convenient for a picnic. Whether you’re grabbing food from inside the pool area or from the beachside vendors, there are great options available.\n\nOverall, it’s a well-rounded, fun place for everyone to enjoy!",

My credit card was cancelled due to unauthorised transactions. I informed the front desk of this a day before the scheduled deduction. The representative who took this information told me it is too late to stop any deduction now. She mailed me later in the day to ask an alternative account for deduction. I did not get a chance to read this email until it was too late.  I was then charge a $10 late fee. I called Goodlife to request for a fee waiver  as this was not the first time my card had to be cancelled due to unauthorised transaction. On the previous occasion, I wasn't charge da late fee as they were informed prior to deduction date. Not this time. The representative whom I spoke to  gave me a number  to call to make the  request. I found that weird. I did not have to do that the last time I had to cancel my credit card. I did anyway. I was told by the other company that since I had already informed  Goodlife of the cancellation a day prior to deduction date, I should get back to Goodlife to ask for waiver. He also let me know a day notice is sufficient to stop the deduction. This sound reasonable to me plus the membership contract was between Goodlife and me. Why do I have to call another company? I could be wrong, but isn't front desk all about customer service? Why did she has to lie that a day notice is insufficient to stop deduction? This club has zero customer service. The front desk is staffed by a lady that tried to weasel her way out of  making a phone call. The toilet and recreation zone (steam and sauna) need a good deep clean. the floor in the shower cubicle and the steam room is slimy and the floor drains in these area definitely needs a thorough clean. Our membership fee and the club's customer service and cleanliness seems to move in opposite direction. They are lots of other options which offer value for money, but I have been a member for close to 10 years now. I just need to get out of my comfort zone and explore other options. But, for those that are considering Goodlife, think twice",

I could be wrong, but isn't front desk all about customer service? Why did she has to lie that a day notice is insufficient to stop deduction? This club has zero customer service. The front desk is staffed by a lady that tried to weasel her way out of  making a phone call. The toilet and recreation zone (steam and sauna) need a good deep clean. the floor in the shower cubicle and the steam room is slimy and the floor drains in these area definitely needs a thorough clean. Our membership fee and the club's customer service and cleanliness seems to move in opposite direction. They are lots of other options which offer value for money, but I have been a member for close to 10 years now. I just need to get out of my comfort zone and explore other options. But, for those that are considering Goodlife, think twice",

Only saving grace is that it is very large open plan upstairs. But I didn't join for the gym. I am still very happy with my local gym at Plus Fitness Manning. I joined for the facilities which are worth the price of entry itself. I signed up to a minimum 3 month fixed term contract to use their swimming pool over summer. I do appreciate Peta's service in getting me the best deal possible. Brooke has  also been very helpful. I got charged my first payment today and I intend on using the pool every day along with the sauna. The rest of the bathrooms are kind of shit so adds to the lackluster care and attention the actual gym itself has. I wouldn't use the showers here compared to other gyms I've been to. But I will continue to use the pool and sauna every day over summer. The facilities themselves are very well maintained by the staff even if the door to the sauna is a bit ajar. As mentioned, staff like Peta and Brooke are wonderful so far and very friendly but I'd only recommend this as a private health club with a swimming pool and sauna and not a gym.",

We were happy to be able to get daily workouts in in their Les Mills classes (Body Pump, Body Attack, Body Balance) and yoga.  The gym is relatively crowded with lots of cardio, stationary and free weight and machines.  You'll find people all over on the floor doing their workouts or working with a personal trainer.  The locker rooms are large but can get very steamy in hot weather.  The front desk staff is very friendly.  The only improvement I would suggest is class scheduling.  Most of the classes I attended started late, largely because they are scheduled pretty close to one another, making it difficult for one group to \"clear out\" before the next class starts.  There may have been other factors as well, not sure.  If they spaced out the classes a bit more or ensured they started and ended on time this would remove a petty annoyance from an otherwise very enjoyable gym experience.  We'll be back in January and plan to sign up again!",

The locker rooms are large but can get very steamy in hot weather.  The front desk staff is very friendly.  The only improvement I would suggest is class scheduling.  Most of the classes I attended started late, largely because they are scheduled pretty close to one another, making it difficult for one group to \"clear out\" before the next class starts.  There may have been other factors as well, not sure.  If they spaced out the classes a bit more or ensured they started and ended on time this would remove a petty annoyance from an otherwise very enjoyable gym experience.  We'll be back in January and plan to sign up again!",

In my opinion, it is a very complete gym that offers everything you need for a good workout, even though there is always room for improvement.\nThe lower level has spacious changing rooms, a sauna, and a large area with plenty of cardio equipment. Upstairs, you will find machines for both upper and lower body training, a spin room, a large studio for group classes, and another smaller room next to it that I believe is used for Pilates sessions.\nThe gym is generally not too crowded during the day, although it gets busy during peak hours such as early mornings and late afternoons. Many machines are available in pairs, which helps a lot when one is already in use.\nThe atmosphere is well balanced, with people who are genuinely motivated to train, creating a positive and energetic environment.",

Went in for a free 5 day trial as advertised on the website only to be told by a staff when I got there that it is only for friends of members and you can have the 5 day pass ONLY IF you are going to join. What is the point of trial then? The staff then proceeded to tell me about this deal they have going on now and wanted me to sign up immediately on my first visit without even a workout there. After asking a few more times and explaining that I would like to try first, he reluctantly gave me the 5 day pass. Started my pass on Monday, and on Wednesday once again he was asking me to join. On Thursday he gave me a call saying that I have to book an appointment to discuss membership options with him on Friday otherwise they have to charge me if I come in for a workout on Friday (despite it was still on a \"5 day trial\") as \"you have no intention to join\". The overly pushy and presumptuous attitude was definitely off-putting as they seem to want you to just buy hastily without consideration and I will not be joining Goodlife.\n\nOn the positive side, the lockers room is clean and spacious, there is a sauna too. The facilities are also new and with good varieties of equipments. However, it is quite crowded even during off-peak times like 2-3pm. Facilities wise I have no complaints, however the rude salesperson indicates that this place might not have the best training environment as staff is just as important as facilities when it comes to choosing a gym. I was told that I could not use the lockers as it's for members only by the staff however on my second visit the front receptionist who was nice and friendly gave me a temporary locker card to use without asking and just asked for a key or ID which was fair.\n\nBased on my negative experience, for anyone who is thinking of joining beware of their AGGRESSIVE SALES TACTICS! Before you sign up please look carefully at the fine print of the contract as this gym seems so sus! With my current gym they only asked me once after my trial ended. This is by far the most pushy gym I've been to so far. I understand gym salesperson would obviously try to sell their gym to the best they can as that's how they make a living from but expecting someone to make a huge financial commitment without trying, persistently asking even before the trial finishes, terminating your trial early because THEY JUDGE YOU as uninterested is LUDICROUS.",

I couldn't see a way to lock it from the inside, but there was a light on the outside to show if it was vacant or not so I guess it should be detecting me being in there and auto-locking.\n\nI double check if there's enough toilet paper left, you can't check, it's all hidden and you push a button for it to unroll a few squares of paper and there's a limit of like 2 button pushes every 10-15 seconds.\n\nI wasn't finished wiping when someone outside pushed the button and the door simply opened....\n\nBut wait, there's more. There's no button to force-flush the toilet, a sign says you either wash your hands (sensor activates the sink) or leave the room. Ok so I wash hands, the toilet starts flushing, weakest flush I've seen in my life, almost none of the toilet paper goes down. I trigger the wash sensor again and the toilet doesn't flush, it's programmed to not flush too frequently because the 3rd time made it flush again.\n\nThat's about it. Enjoy.

Nestled along the gentle curves of the Pacific shore, this family-friendly beach offers golden sands, calm surf, and plenty of space to unwind.\n\nThe shallow, sheltered waters make it ideal for swimming, paddleboarding, or simply wading in on a warm day. Lifeguards patrol certain areas during peak seasons, giving peace of mind to families with young children. There’s usually plenty of parking nearby, as well as clean public toilets and shaded areas—perfect for packing a picnic or setting up a beach umbrella.\n\nWalking paths wind along the dunes and beachfront, connecting to nearby parks and cafes, making it a great spot for a peaceful shoreline stroll. The dunes and coastal grasslands beyond the sand are home to native vegetation and birdlife, offering a little natural oasis just steps from the water.\n\nWhile not as busy as some of the bigger Wollongong beaches, Fairy Meadow Beach has enough amenities—including coffee shops, casual dining options, and takeaway stores—to support a relaxing day by the sea. The vibe is quietly attractive: understated and peaceful, with just enough activity to feel lively without being crowded.\n\nWhether you’re after a gentle swim, family day out, or a serene spot to read a book overlooking the waves, Fairy Meadow Beach delivers a delightful coastal escape close to the city.",

Constant noise from the highway, and drunks at 330am, a teenage football team up early stinking up the place with lynx Africa 😮‍💨\nPlease if you can do one thing to improve this place, get new mattresses. Having now read the reviews I know a 20 year old mattress got plenty of use ‘by the hour’.\nIf I were to stay in the Illawarra again, I would take my chances at another motor inn or fork out the extra to stay at the mantra.",

I’m giving it 3 stars not because it was bad, but because a few key frustrations held it back from being great.\n\nLet’s start with the good stuff. Bulli Beach itself is absolutely beautiful. Waking up to the sound of waves crashing just beyond the dunes is something special. The coastal walk is lovely, and it’s a great spot for early morning strolls or catching the sunrise with a cup of coffee in hand. The ocean breeze helps keep things cool, and there’s a nice balance of open space and shady areas.\n\nFacilities are pretty decent, too. The amenities block was clean and well-maintained during our stay. Showers had good water pressure and stayed warm a must after a day at the beach. There’s a playground for kids, BBQ areas, and a café nearby if you’re not keen on cooking every meal yourself. The park staff were polite and checked us in quickly, though we didn’t see much of them after that.\n\nNow for the not-so-great part: the tent setup. I don’t know what’s under the surface at Bulli, but trying to peg down the tent was a nightmare. Honestly, it was like hammering into cement. We bent several pegs trying to get them in, even after soaking the ground a bit. Eventually, we gave up and used rocks and sandbags to weigh the corners down. I’ve camped in a lot of places, but this was one of the most difficult setups I’ve dealt with. If you’re bringing a tent to Bulli, make sure you have heavy-duty stakes and a rubber mallet or be ready for a serious arm workout and a lot of swearing.\n\nAnother issue was how close the campsites are to each other. There’s not much in the way of privacy, and noise travels easily. We had a group next to us with kids, but be aware that it’s not exactly peaceful if you're hoping for quiet evenings under the stars.\n\nAlso worth noting: the ground doesn’t drain well if it rains. We had a brief shower overnight, and even with a ground tarp, our tent ended up with a few damp patches.\n\nAll that said, the location is hard to beat. If you’ve got a campervan or caravan, I imagine the experience would be much more comfortable. But for tent campers, it’s a bit of a challenge, especially if you’re not prepared for the unforgiving ground.\n\nFinal verdict: 3 stars. Bulli is beautiful, the beach is unbeatable, and the facilities are fine but unless they’ve added jackhammers to the gear hire, pegging your tent here is going to test your patience (and your pegs).",

The location itself is great and we really enjoyed having beach access, but overall the park didn’t quite meet our expectations.\n\nWhen we arrived it was fairly quiet, but it became very busy over the weekend. The park is currently undergoing renovations and adding new sites, though some of the layouts looked quite tight with poles and close proximity to other vans — I’m not sure how easy it will be for larger setups to manoeuvre once it’s finished.\n\nThere wasn’t a lot for kids within the park, which wasn’t ideal, but it did encourage us to explore the surrounding area, which turned out to be a highlight. We loved being close to the beach, but our site became a bit of a thoroughfare for kids walking directly through to the sand. A designated walkway or clearer access point would really help improve privacy for those staying on the beachfront.\n\nThe main downside for us was the amenities. Unfortunately, the bathrooms didn’t appear to be cleaned during our stay, leaving toilet paper, sand, and water scattered around. This was disappointing compared to other parks we’ve stayed at.\n\nOverall, the location is beautiful, and with some improvements to the amenities and general upkeep, the park could become a much better experience for guests. We enjoyed the beach access, but we’d hope to see a few upgrades before considering a future stay.",

Unfortunately the family bathroom is probably one of the worst we’ve come across in a big 4 park. Basically unusable for families with babies, hot water on all occasions was not working, and nowhere to lay your child down to dry them and get them dressed. The room itself looks like it’s meant for more of a laundry type set up.

This unfortunately seems to add to rubbish being left around the area.\nNote that as there’s no firepit provided, charcoal fires are banned. But despite this and a quite windy day, it didn’t stop some pelicans at Nellie’s Glen from lighting a fire to cook, which had quite a large flame going, resulting in 2 Fire trucks and 2 Police Cars attending to douse the fire and hopefully charge the culprits.\nThis was a concern as we were expecting to have to evacuate.\nAnother issue during peak times are the amount of people arriving late attempting to find a camp spot that we had to turn away. Just imagine if any of these people were antagonistic, what then? 🤷🏻‍♂️\nAnd of the 3 nights we stayed, we were woken up at 2am EVERY single night by people driving around the site, parking and then walking around with torches, talking loudly trying to decide where they were going to go 🙄\nThis is ridiculous considering NPWS have an online booking process.\nThese experiences create anxiety, particularly for the 2 girls staying next to us as I had turned away cars of young men looking to camp despite all sites being booked and paid for.\nOn a positive note, our 2 ‘Latin dancing’ neighbours on the 1 site we didn’t book were wonderful.\nI would say during non peak times, we potentially would’ve enjoyed more solitude.\nThe area is 4-5 star but this experience had too many negatives.",

Spread across dramatic headlands, rolling hills, and pristine surf beaches, this park is a paradise for nature lovers, surfers, and families alike.\n\nThe star attraction is The Farm—a world‑class left‑hand point break revered by surfers nationwide. When the swell lines up, it creates long, clean rides that draw experienced wave riders seeking that classic South Coast barrel. Nearby Killalea Beach, also known as Mystics, offers gentler waves and safe swimming—perfect for less confident surfers, bodysurfers, or beachgoers wanting to soak up the sun without crowds.\n\nWalking trails wind through coastal heathland and dunes, offering scenic loops that capture wide ocean views and vibrant native vegetation. Wildflowers and birdlife are abundant during spring and autumn, making these times especially rewarding for photographers and hikers.\n\nCamping is available at Killalea’s camping ground, set amidst grassy paddocks shaded by native trees. Sites are generous and family‑friendly, with basic facilities including toilets, cold showers, and picnic shelter areas. Evenings are best spent gathering around a campfire while listening to ocean waves echoing in the distance.\n\nDespite its natural beauty, the park remains relaxed and unpretentious—no theme park ride here, just unspoiled coast, friendly locals, and a laid‑back atmosphere. Whether you’re chasing waves, pitching a tent for a night under the stars, or simply immersing yourself in coastal wilderness, Killalea Regional Park delivers a refreshing escape from city life.",

Wildflowers and birdlife are abundant during spring and autumn, making these times especially rewarding for photographers and hikers.\n\nCamping is available at Killalea’s camping ground, set amidst grassy paddocks shaded by native trees. Sites are generous and family‑friendly, with basic facilities including toilets, cold showers, and picnic shelter areas. Evenings are best spent gathering around a campfire while listening to ocean waves echoing in the distance.\n\nDespite its natural beauty, the park remains relaxed and unpretentious—no theme park ride here, just unspoiled coast, friendly locals, and a laid‑back atmosphere. Whether you’re chasing waves, pitching a tent for a night under the stars, or simply immersing yourself in coastal wilderness, Killalea Regional Park delivers a refreshing escape from city life.",

The rooms are very small, it definitely used to be student housing. The mattresses are old with metal springs. Absolutely horrible! The shower was dirty and mouldy, I wouldn’t use it. The TV wasn’t great. It had no apps to stream and took ages to connect to your own device.\nThe staff are relatively friendly but their customer service wasn’t great.\nThe only saving grace was the buffet breakfast at Basta. It was a small spread but nicely done. Fresh eggs and good coffee.\nSo much potential with this place, the outside and lobby are really cool but the rooms are really lacking.\nHope to return one day to see some changes! Wollongong needs some nice hotels!",

She was constantly sniffling, blowing her nose, and then massaging me again without sanitising her hands. It took me about 40 minutes to work up to raising the issue, and when I asked if she was okay, her explanation shifted from “my hair got wet in the rain” to “it’s the steam/scents in the room.” The inconsistent excuses and concerns around unhygienic practices made me too uncomfortable to continue, so I stopped the treatment before the facial. I explained that I have an immunocompromised friend and didn’t want to risk exposure if she was unwell. I tried to handle it with kindness, I understood if she was sick, but I wasn’t comfortable continuing.\n\nWhen I raised this with the manager after I wrapped up early she told me they don't do refunds in any circumstances. I left after she said she’d follow up with the owner in this case, but that call never came. Instead, I had to chase them multiple times before finally getting an email that just insisted the therapist wasn’t sick. This did nothing to address the hygiene issue. Despite leaving after only an hour of a 2.5-hour package, I was refused a refund and offered only a credit.\n\nUnder Australian Consumer Law, “no refund” policies don’t apply when services aren’t delivered with acceptable care and skill. Refusing a refund in this situation is, in my view, unlawful.\n\nI also noticed they give incentives for reviews, which makes me question how genuine their ratings are. There are many local businesses that genuinely value their customers - I'd recommend supporting them instead.",

The heated pool can only be used by certain age groups at certain times.  The outside pool is for only under 5s, why??? The indoor pool had lanes which could only be used by those doing laps which meant only one lane for recreation which was occupied by many families. We have been to many public pools with just the standard pool rules and things went smoothly (even with both under and over 5s swimming together). I also agree that some of the female staff need to be more polite.\n\nOn the other hand we tried 5 Star Swim Schools Tuggerah Swim Centre just for a fun swim- not lessons. The pools are bigger and cleaner, the staff are relaxed and kind and we swam in peace and enjoyed ourselves. We were also allowed to use any pool we wanted including the heated pool.",

I have spent about 600 on missed lessons the last year due to thier strict 12hours notice policy. Originally I was told 2 weeks which I could have copped on the chin but 30 days notice? Thats 4/5 swimming lessons? That's close to 100 dollars for lessons we can't attend bumping thier free money up to 700. Not to mention if your direct debit doesn't go through then slug you 16.50 per child. No other option to pay any other way. People are struggling and this business sucks you dry. North wyong swimming centre is much more flexible and understanding. I have also be asked to give a reason why I want to cancel. Um, I want to cancel for personal reason. I didn't realise I entered into a contract that's hard to leave. Not to mention the time limit for makeups (why do you give a time limit then they expire? We paid for it) also the 12 hours notice is ludicrous and isnt practical at all. Alot can happen in that 12 hours. It would mean I would need to call at 3 in the morning to make that time frame, or the day before. So stupid",

          "reviewText": "Trying to cancel your child swimming lesson is a nightmare. They want a months notice even though my daughter is getting really upset about going. I have spent about 600 on missed lessons the last year due to thier strict 12hours notice policy. Originally I was told 2 weeks which I could have copped on the chin but 30 days notice? Thats 4/5 swimming lessons? That's close to 100 dollars for lessons we can't attend bumping thier free money up to 700. Not to mention if your direct debit doesn't go through then slug you 16.50 per child. No other option to pay any other way. People are struggling and this business sucks you dry. North wyong swimming centre is much more flexible and understanding. I have also be asked to give a reason why I want to cancel. Um, I want to cancel for personal reason. I didn't realise I entered into a contract that's hard to leave. Not to mention the time limit for makeups (why do you give a time limit then they expire? We paid for it) also the 12 hours notice is ludicrous and isnt practical at all. Alot can happen in that 12 hours. It would mean I would need to call at 3 in the morning to make that time frame, or the day before. So stupid",

There's nothing like a classic outdoor Olympic pool, and this one is clean, in excellent condition and perfect for lap swimming in all weather,  but especially on a sunny day. The 11 foot 6 inch deep end, a throwback to the days of diving boards, means you can actually dive here outside race events, unlike most newer pools, which tend to be much shallower. This is a serious swimmer's pool, IF you can get unfettered access to it. The three lanes typically reserved for lap swimming lanes aren't really enough. Four would be better.\n\nThe only major problem I have with this pool is convenient access and availability. Bookings for carnivals, parties etc. are common. This is not a place at which you can simply turn up at any time and expect to actually have a swim, unless you get there very early. They probably need the revenue from bookings to keep the place open, but if you are a busy person with limited time for a swim, you may find many opportunities are lost owing to either half or all of the pool being booked out. Saturday mornings are often a write-off for several hours due to water polo, if you really need the full 50 metres like me. The 25 metre partitions are often put in place well before the time of the booking, too. February and March have a lot of bookings for school swimming carnivals. These lost opportunities eat into the value of using memberships/Fitness Passport etc. for regular access (I'm considering cancelling my FP for that reason). And soon after all the carnivals are over, the pool is closed again until October. It feels like it's over again before it even began.\n\nIn conclusion, while the pool itself is fantastic and one of the best 50 metre pools around, actually getting a swim in it can be challenging unless you can always rock up as soon as it opens in the morning.",

There were changing rooms and showers and a lifeguard station.\n\nIn addition there is  a viewing platform nearby where you can sit back, relax and take in the view of the ocean, an impressive sculptural public art work or even participate in an audio walking tour.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend The Grant McBride Ocean Baths to anyone looking for a relaxing and rejuvenating experience in a stunning natural setting.

Identity required clif not a member  eg drivers licence in accord  with nsw club regulations. Had a nice feel i thought. Prices not cheap but not outrageous either.  Good place to go just for  a coffee in comfort or meal if you  are not into swimming or gym stuff.  Members get a discount on purchases. Membership not very expensive  worth joining if you are going v to b be a  regular there.",

The golden sand stretches wide and long, perfect for a peaceful walk or just lying back under the sun. The water was clean and calm, great for both swimming and just dipping your toes in.\n\nWhat really made the visit special was the vibrant but laid-back vibe. The beachfront is lined with charming cafes, little shops, and restaurants where you can grab a coffee or enjoy fresh seafood with an ocean view. We also loved the Terrigal Haven, a short walk from the main beach, perfect spot for snorkeling or watching the sunset.\n\nParking was pretty easy to find, and the area felt safe and family-friendly. Whether you're going with friends, family, or on a solo getaway, Terrigal Beach has something for everyone. Can't wait to go back!",

Terrigal Beach is one of the most popular beaches on the Central Coast . There is designated parking but that can get full very quickly especially when it’s busy. There is a small ocean rock pool tucked away into the cliff on the southern end of the pool and is patrolled all year for safe swimming. There’s good toilet and shower facilities and also handicapped toilets. The picnic areas include grassed areas and under cover picnic tables. There is also a fantastic walking path leading to the Terrigal Boardwalk. There’s plenty of cafes and restaurants around that you can grab something to eat. Unfortunately, the beach does not cater for people with accessibility needs. The view is stunning, so beautiful. Would definitely recommend a visit.",

It’s a favourite spot for both locals and visitors, offering calm waters ideal for swimming, and its gentle waves make it great for families. The beach is the starting point for the popular Bouddi Coastal Walk, which winds along the cliffs and offers stunning views of the coastline. Putty Beach is a fantastic spot for photography, offering expansive views from the point over Broken Bay, Lion Island, and the Northern Beaches.",

There is no toilet around but there is fresh water to wash the sand off. There are also jelly fish in the sand so be sure to let the young ones know and advise them not to touch it. There is no shade so if you go with young children, make sure to dress them appropriately.",

A special shout out to the amazing receptionist who checked me in and looked after me throughout our stay, she set the tone for the whole trip.\n\nThe facilities are excellent and the park is kept spotless. There was some construction underway, but it didn’t hinder my stay or take anything away from the atmosphere. The amenities are modern and well maintained, and the park has a relaxed, comfortable feel. The beach is only a short walk away, and having the Canton Sports Bar literally a step from the park was a great bonus.\n\nPerfect for families, couples or anyone wanting a quiet coastal break with great service. I can’t wait to return.",

You could sit on the veranda and watch the waves crashing in, and being so close to the ocean meant you could even hear the waves while lying in bed — the perfect sound to fall asleep to.\n\nThe cabin itself was fantastic (OMG 😍), and the water pressure in the shower was to die for!

Thank you to Jim the owner and even the cleaners are so nice too…",

Welcomed into the office which is more like walking into their loungeroom, guided to my spot and showed around, retro style meticulously maintained tables and chairs and chunky timber camp kitchen overlooking the lush garden, kids swings etc and absolutely spotless loos and showers. The walk to the beach is about 5 minutes through the multimillion dollar properties of the area, just beautiful. Will definitely be stopping here again. Thanks for providing such a lovely park at a reasonable price.",

The bathrooms look like they have had a renovation but the shower heads were the old ones that were very poor so not sure why these were not upgraded with the rest of the bathroom Reno?? The park has a heap of permanent sites and it doesn’t compliment the park at all. The site fees for caravans is quite high and I am not sure why?? We’ve stayed at other parks with better facilities and direct access to the beach or lake and the prices were no where near the price here. There were no rubbish bins in the caravan area or the cabins for that matter. They were located at the entry gate outside?? Not sure why?? But we weren’t to happy to have to walk to the front gate to empty our small caravan bin. The camp kitchen dining area was occupied all night by local residents and there was no other options. The camp kitchen lights turned off at 9:30pm even though the sign states 10:00pm. The water around the park was very swampy and had an odour to it?? Not the waterfront we were thinking?? The park overall was clean and tidy. There were some new cabins at the waterfront which looked really nice and cosy. We did notice that next door to the premium cabins were two tent sites?? And people in the tents were very noisy with loud music and loud voices. I wouldn’t be happy to pay premium dollar for a waterfront cabin and have people pay a fraction of the price for waterfront views in a powered tent site. Just saying. I’m not trying to be rude with my review only asking these questions?? I would stay here again if I was needing a caravan site overnight or short stay. Sometimes it’s the finishing touches that make the world of difference like the shower heads?? Charge premium but also give premium is my thought?? There was also limited access to the water as there were cabins or other sites that you needed to walk past in order to gain access. Felt uncomfortable walking past peoples cabins and or sites. Look forward to seeing some changes the next time we are in town. It’s a pity because it’s got a great location and it feels 2-3 star at the best.",

The staff are wonderful, there to help out whenever you holler. Shout out to favourite staffer, Tim, who goes out his way to make our experience as pleasant and comfortable as possible.

We were supposed to get milk and cereal as part of the deal. they only gave it once the whole time we were there.  This place has a lot of potential but unfortunately there staff have no idea what’s going on. Your guests are paying a lot of money to stay here. Please look after them properly and this would be a great place to stay .",

Shelly Beach Golf Course is also next door & offers 18 hole golf with golf buggy. Just up the road is the Bateau Bay Square, a mall as good as any with 100s of shops & Maccas etc. We rented an old style 2 bedroom villa & although it's a bit dated & the shower pressure a bit weak other than that no complaints for $100 a night on the weekend in March. There are also beachside cabins which cost a bit more but we were happy to be a few minutes walk away. The kiosk on site offers newspapers, groceries & food on weekends & school holidays. We googled cabins on the Central Coast & found this place & feel like we hit the jackpot because it's great value for the position it's in. Also $3.50 schooners at the Bowlo all day every day 👍🏼",

          "reviewText": "I booked the Ibis Budget Gosford knowing it would be basic and compact, which was perfectly fine for an overnight stay—especially given its association with the Accor brand and standards. However, I was very disappointed to discover a noticeable urine stain on the bed sheet. Unfortunately, I didn’t see it until the morning, which was unpleasant knowing I had slept in it. Regardless of price or star rating, clean linens are a fundamental expectation for any accommodation.\n\nOn top of that, the shower was poorly maintained and fell below even budget expectations. To make matters worse, the roller blind on the window had squashed bugs on it; clearly, when the blind rolls up it crushes insects, and no one has bothered to clean it.\n\nI don’t write reviews often, but I don’t want another guest to go through the same experience, and I hope management addresses these issues promptly.\n\nI am also an employee of an Accor property myself, and I know the brand holds clear expectations for cleanliness and guest care. This experience does not reflect those standards.\n\nThe staff were polite and check-in was smooth, but housekeeping and maintenance clearly need much closer attention. At the very least, guests should be able to expect fresh, spotless sheets, a properly functioning shower, and clean window coverings.",

          "reviewText": "I booked the Ibis Budget Gosford knowing it would be basic and compact, which was perfectly fine for an overnight stay—especially given its association with the Accor brand and standards. However, I was very disappointed to discover a noticeable urine stain on the bed sheet. Unfortunately, I didn’t see it until the morning, which was unpleasant knowing I had slept in it. Regardless of price or star rating, clean linens are a fundamental expectation for any accommodation.\n\nOn top of that, the shower was poorly maintained and fell below even budget expectations. To make matters worse, the roller blind on the window had squashed bugs on it; clearly, when the blind rolls up it crushes insects, and no one has bothered to clean it.\n\nI don’t write reviews often, but I don’t want another guest to go through the same experience, and I hope management addresses these issues promptly.\n\nI am also an employee of an Accor property myself, and I know the brand holds clear expectations for cleanliness and guest care. This experience does not reflect those standards.\n\nThe staff were polite and check-in was smooth, but housekeeping and maintenance clearly need much closer attention. At the very least, guests should be able to expect fresh, spotless sheets, a properly functioning shower, and clean window coverings.",

As I walked into the spa, there was a subtle, pleasant scent that set an initially welcoming tone.\n\nHaving visited many high-end day spas over the years, I did notice a few things that fell short of what I’ve come to expect. The atmosphere wasn’t as tranquil or peaceful as it could have been — the lighting in the treatment room wasn’t particularly dim, and there was notable noise from hotel guests and traffic outside. These distractions made it difficult to fully relax.\n\nIn other spas, I’ve been used to being gently ushered into a quiet space before treatment, offered a robe, slippers, a warm towel, and a calm area to sit with tea and light snacks. On this occasion, I was taken directly to the room and asked to undress and get straight onto the table. I also noticed that the face rest cover appeared to have make-up residue on it, which raised some questions about hygiene and attention to detail.\n\nThe massage itself was satisfactory — it may suit some people’s preferences, though it wasn’t the best I’ve had. The ambient noise and brightness also made it difficult to fully switch off. The face mask also wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would be brushed on and left to set, but instead it was like one of the cheap paper ones you'd get from a pharmacy. It didn't feel indulgent at all.\n\nWhen the treatment ended, I felt a little rushed as I was only halfway dressed when there was a knock at the door. Checking out was also less relaxing than expected, as the front desk staff seemed to be caught up in conversation about a colleague, which came across as unprofessional. It reminded me of the kind of workplace chatter most of us are trying to escape when we visit a spa.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was finding out that access to the hotel facilities — particularly the sauna, steam room, and pool — is no longer offered on weekends with a spa booking. That amenity used to be a highlight and was one of the main reasons I booked. I was told pool access is now only available on weekdays.\n\nWhile there were some positive touches, overall the experience fell short of what I’d hoped for. I don’t think I will return to Endota Spa Terrigal, but I will happily go back to the spa at Magenta Shores, which offers a more consistent sense of relaxation and care.",

Maybe replacing these with some other machines like a T-Bar Row or a supine chest press machine would greatly increase equipment and exercise variety).\n\nAlso, the hip thrust machine specifically feels somewhat odd to use, would recommend replacing it with a belt-secured hip thrust machine (i.e. the Nautilus Glute Drive or similar).\n\nKeep up the great work UFG - you're the best gym in Parramatta for a reason! ⭐⭐⭐⭐",

Some are minor cosmetic issues like faded dumbbell labels or cracked bench padding, but others are much more serious - a few benches are broken, and some of the weight pins on plate-loaded machines look like they’re on their last legs. There are some fantastic Matrix-brand machines here, but they’re too few and far between. Honestly, the whole gym is overdue for a massive equipment refurb.\n\n❌ No towel hire available.\n\n❌ Weights, especially dumbbells and barbells, are often missing or left scattered on the floor. This is something members and staff alike should manage better.\n\n❌ For a gym of this size, it’s surprising that there’s no hack squat machine or glute drive machine.\n\nThe pros:\n\n✅ The Fitness First Parramatta community is wonderful, and the staff are always friendly and helpful.\n\n✅ The Matrix-branded equipment that is here is top-tier — easily some of the best machines you can use.\n\n✅ There’s still a decent variety of machinery overall, with lots of flat and incline bench press stands.\n\n✅ The location is incredibly convenient — right by the Parramatta Light Rail on Macquarie Street, so perfect for anyone commuting.\n\n✅ Much cheaper than some of the boutique gyms nearby\\\n\nOverall, there’s definitely room for improvement - especially in maintenance and equipment variety - but if you’re in Parramatta and want a no-frills gym with a great community at a fair price, it’s still worth checking out.",

The layout is fantastic with dedicated spaces for boxing, cycling, cardio, and Zumba, plus a women-only room that provides privacy and comfort for those who prefer it.\nThe Zumba classes are a highlight—cool dance moves paired with modern music make them fun and fresh, not outdated or cringy. The instructors bring great energy and keep it exciting every time.\nStaff are always friendly and helpful, especially Ann, who goes above and beyond. The gym itself feels spacious and airy thanks to its multi-level design—never crowded, stuffy, or smelly.\nExtra details make the experience even better: the vending machine is always refilled, cold water is available, the change rooms are roomy, and even the soap smells great.\nOverall, Fitness First Parramatta delivers excellent facilities, a welcoming atmosphere, and staff who genuinely care. Highly recommended!",

          "reviewText": "PROS*- YES! ONLY WOMENS gym in Parramatta. I actually get upset when people downplay Women's only Gym.  There has never been a successful women gym other than Fernwood in Australia for more than 35years that speaks volume in itself. Parramatta has been there for more than 18years & has come a long way as well is home for many women like myself which has been 10 years.\n\nIt being a \"WOMEN ONLY\" means..\n*SAFETY-The amount of stories I've heard from mix gyms is insane. I feel nothing but safe, training along women of all ages & race who have alot of respect for each other.  My husband is less worried lol but as a mum, I'm so glad that there is a safe space that my daughter/loved ones can come to exercise without worries and seeing family generations of women (Grandmother to grandaughters) is so empowering. The community at Parramatta is encouraging,full of joy and Inspiration. The women are very welcoming & supportive. The Staff/trainers are friendly & professional\nI can happily Name & vouch for every single one. It's a shame people decided to Public shame specific staff discrediting ones work ethic & even admit fault-Read the Contract Ladies. Update ur Fernwood App/email regularly to receive up to date news/ Check notice boards.\n\n*CRECHE- is available. Knowing that I can bring my child to the gym and (I'm not talking about leaving them in the pram on the fitness floor) but an actual designated space for them makes it possible for us to attend. Yes creche gets booked out fast but that is a given being an only women gym. Try Opt for different times, set alarm to book in advance. There is morning/evening sessions available as well. So thankful we have this option at Parramatta as some Fernwoods unfortunately don't. Let alone most mix gyms don't cater for us Mums so Love that we have creche & Yes it's Free.\n\n*GROUPFITNESS CLASSES- There are so many classes to choose from that are Awesome! Les Mill Programs (pump, Combat, attack etc) to boxing, yoga, cycle the list goes on. Give all the classes a chance, y not u paid for it than if it's not for u then it's Not but I always encourage ladies to try for fun or u may need to switch ur routine to see a change. U can also do it Virtually(using tv).\n\n*PAID PROGRAMS\n*Reformer Pilates - The Reformer Classes are amazing! When I can't do Reformer Classes I take advantage of the Virtual option. Meaning u use the screen when there is No class. Prices I hear/see for 1 session in private studios are expensive. I happily pay the extra at my gym & do Unlimited.\n\n*FIT30- Strength/Hit classes in a smaller group setting for 30mins. I've done Fit30 for almost 7 years now & this is where I've learnt most about Technique, Strength & my preferred training style. Yes there is a designated space but No! all the equipment in that space is not for Fit30 ONLY. We happily share the weights & equipment. As it is smaller group the trainer can be more attentive. IF ur busy & can't be bothered to fix your own workout, Fit30 is there to do it for you. The progress I've seen from fit30 is inspiring!\n\n*Hypoxi -Is only available across all Fernwoods.I have not tried it but witnessing the body change of other women who do hypoxi, show great results.\n\nThe gym is\n-Spacious, Awesome view of Parramatta - Comfy Kitchen area/ lounge\n-Convinent Parking / Close to Public Transport\n-Recovery space-Sauna/steam/cool room + moonsoon Shower\n- Sister Pass-Visit any Fernwood Club in Aus\n- Club Challenges & Personal Training\nHonestly the list goes on..\n\nCons* Access on public holiday make it difficult by Westfields, I'm sure will improve. As women are getting stronger would like to see more weights & crossfit style training In fit30. Some machines do need upgrade.\n\nFernwood Parramatta is my personal playground/home/me time. It has educated me so much on how important it is to prioritise my health. I was always looking at the money side but 10 years later, It Really is YOU GET WHAT YOU PUT IN. If ur looking for a gym that's going to help you long term, I highly recommend Fernwood Parramatta. Hope to see u there.",

To open doors and cuboards was a logistical nightmare\nNo bedside tables a desk and small chair that you couldn't pull out because again the bed was in the way\nTwo very small widows and a whole lot of unnecessary cabinetry taking up space ,enough for 5 people's belongings for weeks. No full length mirror. No air conditioning in common areas and it was 32 degrees. No instructions in room to call front desk so I had to go and find staff to get ice. Staff were sitting in tiny dining room next to front desk eating KFC when I approached\nPerson with children occupied room on floor and the noise transfer was really loud. All doors slammed loudly also.\nAfter realising how loud our room was and finally getting the front desk number I called and asked if there was a more suitable room. They said we can not change rooms as we had been there longer than 3 hours. I said I can not possibly get any rest in this room he said if we paid an extra $50 we can get an up grade from our standard room. I said I thought we did receive our upgrade and he said no because of the festival. That's not my problem I explained he then asked if he could call back after speaking to his supervisor. Called back 5 minutes with same answer and offered to check out at 11 rather than 10 and free continental breakfast which I declined. I asked what was the supervisors name and said I can't tell you I will get into trouble. I don't think he bothered to even ask\nWas awoken regularly through night due to noise and woken at 6am from guests in their rooms.\nPartner and I was hoping to enjoy some quality quiet time instead we sat on a bed in a tiny claustrophobic box hearing the business of other guests. Very disappointed and not feeling rested at all. Basically ruined our stay. Save disappointment and book elsewhere.",

The beds are comfortable and nice to sleep in.\n\nThe kitchen is fully equipped and it’s big enough for a lot of people to comfortably eat and cook.\n\nThe shower is clean, and it’s washed every day.\nThe toilets is small but it’s clean.\n\nOverall I would really recommend this hostel!! It’s suuuuper central. It’s bus stops along the road, and it’s a 4 min walk to the train and metro station called central. It’s a lot of nice cafes and restaurants within 500m of walking and also a lot of bars.\n\nThe hostel is quiet, no noise complaints!!",

The floors, bathrooms, kitchens, showers and rooms are quite musty and unsettling. During my stay I saw plenty of cockroaches, and one dead mouse. There is one washer and dryer. You can go to the nearby laundermat, but the one here is cheaper. The roof is good to see the sky, but nothing more than that. With that being said I’d like to note that the staff is kind and helpful, friendly as well. And the people I met here are very kind and I’m grateful to have met them. I’d suggest this place for those not in search of Luxury, but instead trying to save money and maybe make friends in the mean time. Myself? I’d consider my stay work while.",

The bus driver can stop his journey whenever he want, regardless of the long line of students wait to commute.\n\nAbout the room, only Premium room would have air conditioner and newer facilities. When I come to my friend's standard room, it kinda dirty and old, with no air conditioner.\n\nSo if you are a parent who consider to send your child to live in the village, please take full consideration.

They let us checkin earlier which was super convenient, thank you.\n\nTV limited as mostly paid TV signin only issue if you were spending most of your time in the apartment.  Only coffee pod machine with pods, no tea etc.",

And when i was getting the facial she kept leaving the room and left me there for like 3 minutes each time. The machine was outdated, and was surprised to see face towel in the rice cooker. Lol. And I'm pretty sure my therapist  was the owner.

If I was smiling and looked happy it was because I was relieved to leave your business after the bad experience. When you had called me after reading my review I had advised you that it wasn't a good time to talk due to being the end of the financial year and I was at work. However you had come across as pushy and insisted to try and justify your actions without bothering to understand my unhappiness with the experience, at no time during the call did you offer any empathy or apology. For the record I am not happy with the service in store, the phone call and your response here. I feel I have been ripped off and with bad service to match.\n\nI am happy to move on, so please don't contact me again. I hope you take the feedback on board and wish you and your business all the best. Thanks Junalyn",

On one of his first classes, he was left unattended on the step while the instructor was at the other end of the pool. He fell in and was floating face-down when I had to jump in and pull him out. There was no lifeguard or supervisor, and I was told they only provide one “when staffing allows.”\n\nOver the two months we stayed, there was no consistency with instructors, constant make-up students added into classes, and teachers who didn’t know the kids’ abilities. My son went from loving swimming to clinging to me and refusing to get in. He gained no new skills and has become fearful which is the exact opposite of what we paid for. Overall, a stressful and disappointing experience and a waste of money.",

My son isn’t as fearful anymore to get inside the water and I know it’s because his instructors have made him feel comfortable. My 2 year old loves Miss.Brenda 😂 she’s a tough cookie but Miss.Brenda has made her feel so comfortable in the water seeing as this is her first time taking swimming lessons. It’s still early days for us but expecting to see some good stuff come out of these lessons. Highly recommend.",

Also, the 5-minute time limit for showering after activities is far too short, especially for families with kids. Extending this to 20–30 minutes would make the experience much more relaxed and enjoyable.\n\nLastly, some of the inflatables were noticeably low on air, making them less safe and harder to play on.

There's lots of cool swimming holes nearby; like Kanuka Brook, Blue Pool, and Jellybean Pool, and you can swim at the causeway beach too, which is good for small kids. Glenbrook is like a 15-minute drive away, so you can get a coffee and food fix if you need it. There's a bunch of walks nearby, including the famous Red hands Cave walk. But I rate the Kanuka Brook and other walks above Red hands. The mountain biking includes the infamous Woodford to Glenbrook run, which ends with a cool single track at the Glenbrook end. There another rides too, which circle through Euroka, and there's a short single track down into the camp-site too. Oh, and there's lots of wildlife!",

It looked like someone tried to hide mold with cheap paint instead of actually fixing it. The toilet felt like it was hanging on by a thread every time it was touched, and the shower didn’t even work — we were literally told to use a different room just to wash ourselves. That is beyond ridiculous. The sheets looked filthy, the room felt dirty and neglected, and I honestly felt uncomfortable being in there at all.\n\nAnd the staff? Absolutely infuriating. The service was shockingly unprofessional. When I tried to calmly explain the issues, the manager reacted like a child throwing a tantrum — banging on the table, raising their voice, and acting like I was the problem for daring to point out how unacceptable everything was. I’ve never seen anything like it.

It looked like someone tried to hide mold with cheap paint instead of actually fixing it. The toilet felt like it was hanging on by a thread every time it was touched, and the shower didn’t even work — we were literally told to use a different room just to wash ourselves. That is beyond ridiculous. The sheets looked filthy, the room felt dirty and neglected, and I honestly felt uncomfortable being in there at all.\n\nAnd the staff? Absolutely infuriating. The service was shockingly unprofessional. When I tried to calmly explain the issues, the manager reacted like a child throwing a tantrum — banging on the table, raising their voice, and acting like I was the problem for daring to point out how unacceptable everything was. I’ve never seen anything like it. I walked in expecting a hotel and instead got chaos, disrespect, and zero accountability.\n\nIn my strongest possible opinion, this place is a complete disaster and should be thoroughly investigated or shut down until it can meet even the most basic standards of cleanliness, safety, and professionalism.

The door could not be closed as the skirting tiles had been laid on top of the door jam, the proprietor denied any knowledge of this when we were checking out.

Had to remind her a few times to increase pressure but she never actioned it. Therapist only wiped the oil off my back and nowhere else - as a client, leaving the premises covered in oil is a huge hazard. Had to ask her for a spare hot towel to wipe the rest of my body myself when the massage had finished. Definitely not worthy of $155. This voucher was a gift and I wish I had used it at another location.",

The contrast is what makes it special: still, chlorinated water framed by concrete on one side, and the restless, crashing Pacific just beyond it. Swimming or even standing poolside, you’re constantly aware of the ocean’s presence, close enough to feel dramatic but safely held at a distance.\n\nThe views are undeniably beautiful, especially as waves spill over the pool’s edge, blurring the boundary between human design and nature. Light shifts across the water, the horizon stretches endlessly, and the entire setting feels both grounding and invigorating.

It’s a surreal experience when the waves splash into the pool!\n\nThe facilities provide hot showers, locker & towel hire (additional cost), and even a sauna are available. After your swim, head upstairs to the café for a coffee with a view. Nothing beats sitting there, soaking in the sea breeze after a dip.\n\nIt can get a bit crowded, but honestly, that’s part of the vibe.

Sitting by the edge, you can hear the sound of the waves crashing and watch the ocean stretch out forever. You get a perfect view of Bondi Beach, it’s just stunning. The fresh sea breeze, the blue water, and the energy of the beach below create such a peaceful and unforgettable atmosphere.\nWhether you're stopping by for a drink, a swim, or just to take in the view, this place is truly one of a kind.

The ocean pool sits right on the edge of the headland, white rails against turquoise, and waves occasionally lift a veil of spray over the lap lanes. It looks like a postcard from the promenade, but the real fun starts when you pay the small entry and step down to the deck. Lifeguards keep a casual but watchful eye, lane ropes are set for steady laps, and the thud of the surf becomes a metronome. On a calm day the pool is glassy and blue. When the swell is up you get a salty slap across your shoulders and a quick grin at the person in the next lane.\n\nFacilities are exactly what you want for a swim with a side of scenery. Change rooms are tidy, hot showers take the edge off the wind, and there are benches where you can wrap up in a towel and watch the horizon. Bring goggles and a cap if you plan to put in some distance, and throw a dry layer in your bag because the breeze can turn suddenly. The adjoining sauna is a welcome thaw after a few cold laps, and grabbing a coffee from the kiosk before or after adds to the ritual. If you are not swimming, the clifftop terrace is a brilliant spot to watch the light shift across the bay and to take a few photos without getting splashed.\n\nWeekday mornings feel almost meditative, while weekends buzz with families, visiting swimmers and locals getting their fix. Entry is open to everyone, no membership required, which keeps the vibe welcoming. Respect the whistle if conditions kick up, rinse the salt from the deck when you are done, and give yourself time to sit and take it all in. Few places wrap exercise, sea air and a front row Bondi view into one simple experience quite as neatly as Icebergs.",

I wasn't disappointed, spectacular views, great food a rather busy swimming pool - I wasn't tempted in any way to join the swimmers... lol!\n\nSpecial gathering for my mum's 90th birthday gathering. The views are stunning the menu supplements the view. We were in the bistro on the middle floor. Because I was so late to arrive, I missed the main lunch and I ended up only having a bowl of chips. The chips were pretty good but the massive fantastic selection of condiments blew my mind blue... Lol. I have taken a photo but I really want to tell you in person about the condiments. There is horseradish, hot english mustard, there is a bottle that says hot hot hot, I'm assuming that is hot sauce. There is malt vinegar, HP sauce, Sriracha Sauce which is Thai. Plus where would be with out good old fashioned tomato sauce or ketchup as some like to call it.\n\nAfter a day that was a tad stressful too me, I rather enjoyed the refreshing Elderberry Spritzer it was so good, that I had a second . Because I was so rushed and running late, enjoy the pictures so you can have a look at the lovely fantastic choices that I didn't have a chance to try.\n\nI'm told that the snapper pie was awesome.",

Incredible swims each day, a couple of gentle hikes, daily whale encounters, dolphins, manta rays, sting rays and more.... Swam more in 3 days than I'd usually do in month but the sites were so well chosen, with great consideration for weather, tides and currents, that it was completely achievable. Plus having the support boats nearby gave me the confidence to push on when I was tired, knowing all I had to do was raise my hand if I was done and I would be plucked from the ocean.\n\nAbsolutely unforgettable trip with generous food, drinks and service throughout. A big enough group to be great fun and a broad mix of swimming buddies but also small enough to be intimate and familiar.\n\nLoved every minute of it and will definitely consider doing it (or another location) again in the future.\n\nI've also done 2 ocean swimming clinics with Andre at the Noosa Summer Swim and learnt heaps both times. And I highly recommend his online training videos to anyone who is starting to ocean swim or wanting to improve their skills - an amazing wealth of knowledge in bite-size chunks!\n\nThanks to everyone involved in making this trip so marvelous ❤️",

It's less of a manicured pool and more of a \"bogey hole\" carved out by nature and early human construction, making it a true local favourite.\n​⭐ The Vibe: Hidden Ocean Escape\n​Often quieter than the main beach, Giles Baths feels like a secret, rugged sanctuary. As you descend the stairs (passing through the poignant memorial portico—the only remnant of the old Giles Gym and Baths), you are greeted with a spectacular view of the pool against the open ocean.\n​Natural Beauty: The pool is surrounded by dramatic sandstone and offers breathtaking coastal views, perfect for watching the sunrise.\n​The Experience: It's an invigorating swim. The pool is open to the ocean, meaning clear, fresh water constantly washes in, creating a fun, wavy environment, especially at mid to high tide. Bring a snorkel—visitors frequently report seeing small fish and other marine life!\n​Historical Charm: The site was originally known as the Gentlemen's Baths in the 19th century and has a fascinating history involving hydrotherapy, hot sea baths, and even an old gymnasium.\n​🏊 Top Tips for Your Visit.Feature Details & Review Caution\nSwimming Beautifully clear water. A good length (around 55m) for a proper swim, but you'll be swimming with the waves. Depth varies greatly with the tide. The water can be deep.\nAccessibility Access is via steep stairs from Dunningham Reserve (near the Bali Memorial archway). Not wheelchair or pram accessible. Uneven, sometimes slippery rocks make entry and exit challenging for those with mobility issues or small children.\nBest Tide Mid to High Tide is best for a deep, fun swim with crashing waves. Low tide can be a little shallow. Strong swells can make conditions tricky and potentially dangerous. Use caution and assess the conditions before entering. No lifeguard on duty.\nFacilities Very basic. There are no changerooms or toilets directly at the pool.

They have lockers for purchase to use and towels to rent. Great place!!!",

If I had to describe this gym with an Australian rock band, it would be Crowded House. It’s more overcrowded than ever and the change rooms are still filthy. The equipment has improved but that’s no use if I have to wait ages to use it. I went at 3pm on a Sunday, which is normally pretty quiet but it was bedlam. I can only imagine what it’s like during peak hours and I do not wish to find out. It’s a nightmare getting benches, racks or machines. The clientele is like the cast of Love Island if it was just blokes. Despite the overcrowding, these guys just hog machines while scrolling on their phones doing three sets of Instagram. Terrible gym culture and etiquette. If I still lived in the area, I would avoid it like the plague - if a plague doesn’t spread from the men’s change room first. Probably better off going to Anytime or Virgin in Bondi Junction. Pilates is actually decent value but is constantly booked out. Have had better luck going to George and Park St in the city. Have also had bad experiences trying to cancel my membership with them before. They said I’d have to fly from Melbourne to Sydney to cancel my it, like some sort of business trip to cancel my gym membership 💀You also have to give four weeks notice to cancel your membership. That’s a longer notice period than for quitting my job. Fitness First, I don’t work for you champ, I am your customer. Only reason I’m still with them is because there are a couple of decent ones near me in Melb. Hope they turn the Bondi establishment around because it’s in shambles.",

The machines are sticky, the mats are filthy, and the whole place feels like it hasn’t been properly cleaned in months.\n\nI don’t know how this place is still open. This place needs to be shut down at this point, It’s unhygienic, overcrowded, and completely neglected. Every visit makes me feel dirtier than before I went in. And to top it all off, the staff were unbelievably rude — completely dismissive, uninterested, and downright disgusting in the way they spoke to me. Don’t waste your money here when there are so many other gyms that will provide you a quality environment.\n\nI also saw people walking in without even tapping their cards where is the regulations to ensure people are members??",

The machines are sticky, the mats are filthy, and the whole place feels like it hasn’t been properly cleaned in months.\n\nI don’t know how this place is still open. This place needs to be shut down at this point, It’s unhygienic, overcrowded, and completely neglected. Every visit makes me feel dirtier than before I went in. And to top it all off, the staff were unbelievably rude — completely dismissive, uninterested, and downright disgusting in the way they spoke to me. Don’t waste your money here when there are so many other gyms that will provide you a quality environment.\n\nI also saw people walking in without even tapping their cards where is the regulations to ensure people are members??",

As someone visiting from Vancouver, Canada, where the ocean is calm and clear, I was instantly captivated by the dynamic energy of Bondi Beach. The south end, in particular, stands out for its quieter, more peaceful vibe, making it a fantastic spot to unwind while still being close to the action.\n\nOne of the standout features of South Bondi is the Bondi Pavilion, a heritage-listed building that has recently undergone a beautiful restoration. Situated just a short walk from the southern end of the beach, it offers incredible views of the ocean while also serving as a cultural hub with cafes, galleries, and event spaces. The Pavilion’s modern amenities combined with its rich history make it a must-visit for anyone coming to the area.\n\nA true gem of South Bondi is the iconic Icebergs Pool and Bar. Perched at the southernmost tip of Bondi Beach, this world-famous saltwater pool is set right on the edge of the ocean, offering swimmers an unmatched experience. It’s a place where you can enjoy a refreshing swim while taking in panoramic views of the rugged coastline and the vast Pacific Ocean. After your swim, head to the Icebergs Bar for a well-deserved drink. The bar has a laid-back, stylish vibe with a great selection of cocktails and snacks, making it the perfect spot to relax and enjoy the stunning surroundings. It's a true Bondi institution and offers a memorable experience for both locals and visitors alike.\n\nBeyond the Icebergs, the Wally Weekes Ocean Pool is another serene tidal rock pool located near the southern section of the beach. It’s an ideal spot for a quiet swim, offering a more peaceful alternative to the bustling surf of Bondi. The nearby North Bondi Children’s Pool provides shallow, safe waters for families, making it perfect for young children to enjoy the sea.\n\nFor those looking for a bit of green space, the Biddigal Reserve is a lovely park near the southern end of the beach, offering sweeping views of the coastline. It’s a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the natural surroundings, away from the crowds of the main beach area.\n\nSouth Bondi Beach is also a great place to embrace the active, sporty atmosphere that defines Bondi. You’ll find people out jogging along the coastline, practicing yoga on the grass, and of course, surfers catching the waves. The local community here truly embodies an outdoor lifestyle, with a healthy focus on fitness and the environment. Watching people embrace the ocean, whether for a morning run, a swim, or a surf session, is inspiring. It’s also common to see visitors waking up early to catch the breathtaking sunrise or later in the day for a sunset walk along the beach.\n\nAdditionally, the south end of Bondi is lined with a range of cafes, bars, and shops, making it a great spot to grab a refreshing drink or snack. The area’s more relaxed vibe compared to the north provides a peaceful setting where you can enjoy the natural beauty of Bondi while having access to all the amenities you need.\n\nOverall, South Bondi Beach is the perfect spot for anyone looking to experience Bondi’s natural beauty, culture, and active coastal lifestyle, without the intense crowds of the main beach area. Whether you’re here for a peaceful swim in the Icebergs Pool, a quiet stroll through the reserve, or simply to enjoy the views, South Bondi offers a welcoming and laid-back escape with a touch of Bondi’s unique charm.",

The beachfront promenade, Campbell Parade, is lined with cafes, restaurants, bars, and boutique shops, offering a wide range of dining and shopping options.\n\nOverall, Bondi Beach is not only a beautiful and picturesque destination, but also a vibrant and lively hub that attracts locals and visitors alike. It is an excellent place to relax, swim, surf, or simply enjoy the coastal scenery while immersing yourself in the unique beach culture of Australia.",

          "reviewText": "Nestled on a stunning headland between the iconic Bondi and Tamarama beaches, Marks Park is a coastal gem that offers far more than just a place to sit on the grass. It’s a multi-faceted destination perfect for tourists and locals alike, boasting breathtaking views, a dedicated kids' play area, and a dog-friendly space.\nBreathtaking Views: A Photographer's Paradise\nThe panoramic vistas from Marks Park are, without a doubt, the main event. Perched high above the Pacific Ocean, the park offers uninterrupted, sweeping views that stretch from Bondi in the north all the way to Maroubra Beach and beyond in the south. The dramatic sandstone cliffs, the crashing waves below, and the endless blue of the ocean create a spectacular backdrop for a picnic, a walk, or simply a moment of quiet contemplation. It's a key vantage point along the famous Bondi to Bronte coastal walk, making it a popular rest stop for walkers and photographers. Whether you're capturing the sunrise over the water or the vibrant colors of a sunset, the scenery is truly unforgettable.\nWhale Watching: An Unforgettable Seasonal Spectacle\nMarks Park is renowned as one of Sydney's premier land-based whale-watching spots. From May to November each year, thousands of humpback whales migrate along the coast, and the park's elevated position provides a front-row seat to their incredible journey. You'll often see them breaching, slapping their tails, or simply spouting water from their blowholes as they pass by. The park even has dedicated whale-watching platforms and informative signs to help you identify the whales and their behaviors. Bring a pair of binoculars and a camera with a good zoom lens to get the best views. The period from late June to early July is a peak time for the northern migration, while September to November is an excellent time to spot mothers and their new calves on the return journey south.\nKids' Play Area: Fun for the Little Ones\nFor families, Marks Park is a fantastic choice, thanks to its well-maintained kids' play area. Located near the amenities, the playground offers a safe and engaging space for children to burn off some energy. It's a great spot to let the kids play while you enjoy the magnificent coastal scenery. The playground's proximity to the main park areas means you can keep an eye on the children without sacrificing the stunning views.\nDog Park: A Place for Pups and Their People\nMarks Park is a great spot for dog owners, offering a designated off-leash area for furry friends. While not fully fenced, a section of the park is \"timeshare\" for dogs, meaning they are allowed off-leash daily between 4:30 pm and 8:30 am. This makes it an ideal place for a morning or evening run with your pet. The open, grassy space allows dogs of all sizes to socialize and play, and you'll often find a friendly community of fellow dog lovers. The park provides bins and bags for waste, making it easy to keep the area clean. Just be sure to keep your dog on a leash when walking on the coastal path that runs through the park.\nAmenities and Practicalities\nThe park has well-maintained public amenities, including toilets that have recently been refurbished to a high standard. There is some parking available nearby, but it can be busy, especially during peak times and popular events like the annual \"Sculpture by the Sea\" exhibition, which uses the park as a key part of its display route. With its stunning views, diverse amenities, and prime location, Marks Park is a must-visit destination that beautifully encapsulates the unique spirit of Sydney's eastern coastline.",

Pool lovely and clean. Area so quiet. Mainly permanents but friendly hello whenever we saw each other. Andy and Kylie great chatters and look after the place well. Off street parking with boom gate. Internet and phone a bit patchy at times. Beach across road. Great kids playground 100m up the road. A few cafes around serving delicious Tobys estate coffee. Thoroughly enjoyed my time. I would definitely stay at Silver Beach Tourist Park again.",

Uneven flooring with hotspots due to I assume electrical cabling underneath, feel like you’re gonna fall through the hallway floors with uneven squeaky wood covered by dirty carpet to mask it, lifts make scraping noises constantly. Walls are paper thin, so can hear your neighbours as if they were in your room even in the day time.\n\nPub downstairs is decent for the price, but if you’re staying at the hotel itself. Pick anywhere else. Place is a dump honestly that clearly lives off its location more than its service and accommodation. The money is made downstairs along with the pokies machines clearly so there’s no incentive to fix the hotel itself. Don’t give this place your money.\n\nOutside noise can be understood to a degree, as you’re given earplugs for your stay which should be warning enough to leave, but you’ll be annoyed with the noises internally more than outside on the strip. That’s if you can get past the dirty bathroom and stained towel upon your arrival.",

It was a long haul to get there, but worth every mile traveled to get there. We were greeted with so much joy and hospitality by Laura at the front desk. She was incredibly welcoming and helpful in guiding us on what to do and how to get around the city. We were able to check in early, which was great, considering our travels. I cannot say enough great things about Laura, her thoughtfulness, enthusiasm, guidance and her assistance. Since we were preparing for the race, she helped secure a reservation for a larger group in Sydney. The hotel itself is perfectly located in Bondi Beach with easy access to the beach and plenty of restaurants. Additionally, there is a bus stop across the street that got us into Sydney very easily and conveniently. The layout of the room was perfect! The room had a balcony, couch, desk, nice bathroom, cooking surface and washer/dryer combo. Upon our return to Australia, I will stay there again! Cheers!",

The location is genuinely unbeatable, right in the heart of Double Bay, surrounded by amazing shops, restaurants, and bars. It was meant to be a special birthday weekend for me, and my best friend even flew out from California for two kid-free nights.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience was disappointing from the moment we arrived. The hotel is extremely dated, and the cleanliness was well below standard. We had to request room cleaning several times, and even then, the tables weren’t wiped properly. The bathroom still had a used bar of soap from the previous guest, and there was hair stuck to the shower walls.\n\nThe biggest letdown was the pool. It was shut down, the main reason we booked this hotel for a hot weekend and then we were asked to leave at 4 p.m. due to a private event, something we were never informed about. Had I known, I definitely wouldn’t have spent $800 a night.\n\nWhile the hotel did offer some IHG points and deducted part of our bar tab as compensation, the stay overall fell far short of expectations. It feels like the property relies solely on its prime location and doesn’t make the effort to deliver a quality experience.\n\nSadly, I won’t be staying here again. There are definitely much better hotel options in Sydney",

Each and every staff member is fantastic. My room had a lovely marble bathroom and the shower, bathtub and toilet were all separate, including everything you could ever need in the amenities provided. The view of the bay was spectacular, especially at night. The location is great being steps from all Double Bay restaurants and pubs. The buffet breakfast is outstanding, where you get an amazing array of fruit and veg to juice yourself according to how much of each fruit and veg you like. The concierge is world-class (Vanessa). Anytime you ring up to get anything from any other area of the hotel (such as housekeeping) is attended to quickly. Yet the price of the rooms is surprisingly low considering the quality you get. It’s also really peaceful and quiet here. This is the hotel which all other hotels should be taking the lead from. Hope to be back in Sydney just to come back and stay here.",

That's because there's just much better utilities offered compared to the utilities offered for men.\n\nMen have a separate bathroom from the shower room and there's sinks outside in the hallway. This can be an issue for men who prefer to have the toilet, shower and sink all combined in the same room (it's also a little awkward to shave in the middle of the hallway).\n\nWomen have all utilities combined in the same room which is much better.\n\nThere's a TON of stairs and no elevator access. In order to even get to reception you need to climb a flight of stairs.\n\nOther than that, reception closes fairly early so if you have issues with the room, like how my bedside lamp is flickering, I'm not really able to contact reception and have something done about it (they close at 10pm and I only just turned the lamp on at around the same time).\n\nThose are the only negatives I've found in my short stay, but keep in mind this is not a high quality hotel. You get what you pay for so other issues that I otherwise would mention will be ignored for this review.\n\nSome positives: While I'm writing this review in the middle of my single night stay, there's an events board and while I haven't had the chance to try any,  there seems to b a good mix of events so that there's something for everyone.\n\nThe staff are also super cool and friendly, while they're not as accommodating as I'd like for people with disabilities,  they're also not terrible like those at Little Bigots down the road.\n\nThey're positioned in such an amazing location, literally opposite Bondi Beach. I really don't think you find anywhere as affordable in such a great location as Wake Up.\n\nSo while Wake Up does have some pros and cons and while I personally don't see myself checking in here ever again (unless structural changes are made), I would still highly recommend Wake Up to women looking for an affordable stay in a prime location.",

          "reviewText": "Very unpleasant stay. I stayed at little drifter hostel for 8 nights, 4 female room superior. the location is great 2 min walking from the beach, but that’s it.\nThe hostel is not accessible for someone with disabilities, there isn’t a lift so you have to carry all your bags up and down the stairs. The common areas are all underground with no natural light and they close at 11pm, which is absurd to me you can’t access your own food or have a glass of water. Also half of the kitchen doesn’t work, 4/8 stove top are broken.\nThe room was a decent size but it was a superior, the en-suite bathroom is so small when you sit on the toilet your knees touch the wall in front of you. It’s like a plane bathroom.\nThe staff is always in bad mood, I had to ask for multiple times for 2 days for a clean rug for the shower, and they tried to gaslight me telling me “they always clean the room every day and change the rug”, I don’t know maybe they think they clean the room just emptying the trash can.\nTherefore I had 3 English roommates who came in late at night drunk, loud and eating crappy and smelly food on the floor at 3 am. I called the night reception because I couldn’t sleep, “I’m so sorry, but we can’t do anything right now”, so I had to stay in that situation.\nNot to mention there isn’t enough storage space inside the room, the “closet” is so small and without shelfs you can’t really use it.\nThe hostel is quite expensive compared to others, it’s definitely not worth it.",

The staff were pleasant enough and the cafe on the corner was nice. I noticed the name of the place has changed. It was Village Bondi when i was there 2024/25. Are they dodging taxes or something lol. Bondi is nice but I wouldnt go back. I have had absolutely fantastic holidays in Oz but i had a better time in Benidorm. The weather was phenominal in both Benidorm and Sydney but Benidorm was cheaper and I was able to swim in the sea. The water was warmer and no waves, it was nice n calm and relaxing.\n\nLesley from Glasgow UK :)",

The destination was great, the roof top terrace allowed you to look over Tamarama Beach and also Bondi Beach. It was only a 5-10 minute walk to all amenities. Also had a very good laundry service opposite to wash, dry and iron your clothes for cheap!",

However, the room is very small and very much what you pay for - but has good views and is actually pretty good considering it's location near the beach and bus stop. Some other guests weren't very considerate of others either, meaning you might be woken up by some stampeding kids running to their room or the bathroom after a rough night but you're still able to get a pretty good sleep in the beds if you're not a light sleeper. Wi-Fi was free, slow but workable and nothing really to complain about. The only real issue that I encountered was the girls bathrooms which didn't have proper privacy, the showers either had a flimsy curtain that could be easily peeked through or a see-through door that offered no protection from unwanted eyes. This can be fixed easily so I'm sure it won't be that big of an issue for others who were prepared and brought swimmers they'd be happy to shower in. Other than that, as I said the views are great and the location is amazing since it is so close to the beach and shops as well as the public transport, staff are friendly and Noahs comes off as a place that would be great to stay in if you're looking for a good budget place to stay.",

We checked out half an hour late and was charged $25 even still with the horrible cleanliness. I would never go back, I dreaded even going back to the hostel the 2 nights we stayed there. We dared not eat in the hostel in case any of our shower friends joined us. The toilets had wet toilet paper in a pile beside them with water and pee everywhere, and some were pissing toilet paper and door locks. If we went to the bathroom, we couldn't sit on the seat because of the mess. When we arrived, there were 15+ garbage bags piled up at the bottom of the stairs that smelt worse than the stench pouring out of the men's bathroom (which was bad enough). We paid $35 each night for a twin room. Trust me, even if it's more expensive, spend your money elsewhere!!!",

The room was very basic, as mentioned very dirty and unacceptable for $70/ night for a private room. I don't expect hostels to be immaculate however some standard of basic hygiene and cleanliness would be expected.\nThis hostel is VERY noisy, again I expect hostels to be a little noisy however they take it to a whole new level. There is a pub downstairs and I realise they are separate businesses however when there is live music downstairs tell your guests so they are aware and can make plans to avoid it (especially at 9:30pm on a Sunday night). Wasn't mentioned to us on check in nor did they tell us that it would be noisy from 9-11pm as we could of made plans to avoid this.\nOur room was above where the band was playing and it was vibrating, rattling and shaking the floorboards. We were in there for 5 mins and both me and my partner had a headache. So we decided to leave as the noisy was unbearable especially for the next 2 hrs!!!\nSo had to pay for this room plus another hostel...not happy!!! They have refused to refund that 1 nights accommodation for providing an inadequate level of service.\n\nDo all yourselves a favour and avoid at all costs. This place is a joke and its embarrassing.",

The bathrooms and showers are very unkept, constant smell or urine and floors are always wet in the bathroom from the showers bad draining system. There is no safety measures at all, the front door has electric wires hanging out of it and we were given codes for the gate and front door however both were just left open all night for anyone to wander in.  I got up at 2am and had to lock both myself on one occasion for our own safety.  Although the usual signs everywhere to keep quiet after 10pm which is basic hostel etiquette, there are no staff to ensure this is followed so unfortunately during our stay we were kept awake until all hours by a group of boys screaming and shouting all around the hostel until 5am and smoking marajuana and treating it as there own party house. On our information sheet it said night staff on duty from 7am-7pm but it did not exist and no staff were there to ensure the hostel was quiet or locked up and safe at night. Staff were all very nice during the day however they seemed aware of the loud evenings but nothing was done and the guests were still allowed to stay and continued to make excessive noise during our 4 night stay. Overall I wouldn’t recommend it  needs a serious review of staff and management structure to make guests feel more comfortable and safe.",

Other features include still/sparkling water, private bathrooms and coded lockers.\n\nThere were around 15 other people during our session which felt a tad busy, but it is a shared bathhouse after all and everyone was generally respectful of the silent session.\n\nParking is a bit difficult.

Over the past few months, she’s taken Betsy out swimming from Manly to Shelly Beach on weekends (whenever we’ve been able to make it), and the transformation has been remarkable.\n\nNot only has Betsy’s swimming improved, but her confidence in the ocean has skyrocketed, and so has her genuine love for the water. Linda brings a calm, encouraging presence that makes kids feel safe, seen, and empowered to push themselves just that little bit further each time.\n\nWe’re so grateful for the care and enthusiasm Linda brings to every swim. Her approach has had a lasting impact not just on Betsy’s skills, but on how she feels about herself in the water. Highly recommend Good Swim Manly to any family wanting their child to gain both technique and joy in the ocean!",

Good sized beach with a grassed area to relax on if you don't like the sand and a cool cafe. #LetsGuide #littlemanly #oceanpool #sydneyharbour #swimming",

There’s also a lovely sense of community here that makes every visit enjoyable.\n\nI’m also looking forward to trying more of the beachside classes such a unique and refreshing addition.

We immediately got fresh towels when requested and being across from the beach - everyone trudged in with sand, but the staff kept the premises exceptionally clean & presentable.\n\nThe pool in Sebel building was cold but we were allowed access to the warm pool in Peppers building.

We just wanted a quick weekend getaway and to check the place out. We chose this hotel because it’s less than 30 minutes from Manly. We didn’t want to book directly in the Manly area as it was more expensive and crowded due to the holiday break.\n\nThe Albert Hotel gave us exactly what we needed: peaceful relaxation away from the city and the busy beachside area.\n\nI especially love their comfortable beds and soft bathrobes. This time, we stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, and my husband surprised me by booking a heritage deluxe suite with a balcony view.\n\nWe truly appreciated the warm and helpful customer service, and the included breakfast was very filling, and the chef was so friendly, even taking the time to chat with us and ensure we were delighted with our meal.\n\nThe room was clean and spacious, equipped with an iron and a hairdryer in the bathroom. We also enjoyed the bathtub, and were surprised by the complimentary champagne they offered.\n\nWe highly recommend this place!\n\nRatings:\nCleanliness – 5/5\nCustomer Service – 5/5\nMeals – 5/5",

Compared to the other hostels in that area it is a lot more calm and chill and has a lot of long term guests. The vibe in the hostel is like a big family and it’s pretty easy to make good friends there especially as a solo traveler. The rooms are nothing special but cleaned regularly and with their own bathroom and shower. The kitchen has basically everything you would need, gas stove, big oven, toaster and microwave, etc. The staff is also really nice and helpful, especially Alex, she is the best :)\nI can only recommend to stay here if u come to Sydney, especially if u want to enjoy the beach and surf!",

          "reviewText": "My partner and I both have monthly deep tissue massages, due to the physical nature of our respective jobs, by a therapist who comes to our home.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Sydney, we impulsively decided to have a more relaxing treatment but specifically wanted a Reflexology Foot Massage. Being joined by fellow travellers meant that the place we originally booked couldn't accommodate the four of us together so decided to go to Manly as planned and 'see how the day takes us'.\n\nOn our wonder around Manly we came across Siamese Thai Massage and went in to negotiate how the needs of four patrons travelling together could best be met.\n\nWanting two treatments each my partner and I went in first. We asked for an oil body massage and asked if the foot massage was a reflexology foot massage. They confirmed that it was so paid for both treatments.\n\nWe were shown to two adjoining rooms downstairs with an open sliding door to facilitate access between them. The rooms appeared well equipped and clean.\n\nThere was therapeutic value in the massage but left with some concerns.\n\nHaving not experienced a Reflexology Foot Massage before, I didn't know what to expect. I heard my partner asking questions during this treatment and the answers made it readily apparent that neither therapist even knew what Reflexology was let alone action an effective treatment. So we were cleared duped into paying for a treatment that wasn't as requested. We do not tolerate such deception from any kind of business.\n\nMy other concerns were with borderline or questionable inappropriate bodily contact.\n\nAreas of the body were massaged that aren't usually massaged by our own therapist. So, after our treatments, we both compared notes. We both received 'therapy' on our 'gluteus maximus' so accepted that as valid. However, my partner didn't receive an over concentration of the top of the leg area. Only I received that 'treatment'. My top inner thigh was 'extensively' massaged. The therapist also did things like caressing my ear and face (not in a massage sense).\n\nMy partner also noted that the sliding door had been pushed shut during our session. We were, on occassion, conversing through the open door and we're clearly together so the there was no reason to shut the door for 'privacy' reasons, especially given that it remained open while we undressed in preparation for our treatments. I heard my partner ask to remove the towel from over her eyes. Mine remained in place so was oblivious to the door being shut.\n\nI don't consider myself to be a naive person. I'm fully aware of the kind of things that go on in some massage venues, especially in the Sydney area.\n\nSo I've drawn two possible explanations to the questionable bodily contact as described above.\n\n1. The therapist genuinely took a shine to me (unprofessional at best) or,\n\n2. It was attempt to get me in a state of arousal so that 'other' services couldn't be offered.\n\nHaving never engaged the services of a sex worker or massage therapist who performs such duties, I couldn't comment on which were true but will say this, the 'professional' relationship between a therapist and client was breached (at best).\n\nThe number of stars given in this review is based on the therapeutic value of the treatments and the cleanliness of the premises based on what I witnessed viruses the deliberate deception regarding the Reflexology treatment (or lack thereof).\n\nThe text above are facts as I know them but acknowledge that my opinions and interpretations on what I experienced are based on some assumptions and the comparison between two people receiving the same treatment at the same time by two different therapists.\n\nI make no accusations of any kind and I'll allow you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nUPDATE: As requested, we visited at approximately 1330 on Monday 10 Nov 25. Two people initially.",

          "reviewText": "My partner and I both have monthly deep tissue massages, due to the physical nature of our respective jobs, by a therapist who comes to our home.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Sydney, we impulsively decided to have a more relaxing treatment but specifically wanted a Reflexology Foot Massage. Being joined by fellow travellers meant that the place we originally booked couldn't accommodate the four of us together so decided to go to Manly as planned and 'see how the day takes us'.\n\nOn our wonder around Manly we came across Siamese Thai Massage and went in to negotiate how the needs of four patrons travelling together could best be met.\n\nWanting two treatments each my partner and I went in first. We asked for an oil body massage and asked if the foot massage was a reflexology foot massage. They confirmed that it was so paid for both treatments.\n\nWe were shown to two adjoining rooms downstairs with an open sliding door to facilitate access between them. The rooms appeared well equipped and clean.\n\nThere was therapeutic value in the massage but left with some concerns.\n\nHaving not experienced a Reflexology Foot Massage before, I didn't know what to expect. I heard my partner asking questions during this treatment and the answers made it readily apparent that neither therapist even knew what Reflexology was let alone action an effective treatment. So we were cleared duped into paying for a treatment that wasn't as requested. We do not tolerate such deception from any kind of business.\n\nMy other concerns were with borderline or questionable inappropriate bodily contact.\n\nAreas of the body were massaged that aren't usually massaged by our own therapist. So, after our treatments, we both compared notes. We both received 'therapy' on our 'gluteus maximus' so accepted that as valid. However, my partner didn't receive an over concentration of the top of the leg area. Only I received that 'treatment'. My top inner thigh was 'extensively' massaged. The therapist also did things like caressing my ear and face (not in a massage sense).\n\nMy partner also noted that the sliding door had been pushed shut during our session. We were, on occassion, conversing through the open door and we're clearly together so the there was no reason to shut the door for 'privacy' reasons, especially given that it remained open while we undressed in preparation for our treatments. I heard my partner ask to remove the towel from over her eyes. Mine remained in place so was oblivious to the door being shut.\n\nI don't consider myself to be a naive person. I'm fully aware of the kind of things that go on in some massage venues, especially in the Sydney area.\n\nSo I've drawn two possible explanations to the questionable bodily contact as described above.\n\n1. The therapist genuinely took a shine to me (unprofessional at best) or,\n\n2. It was attempt to get me in a state of arousal so that 'other' services couldn't be offered.\n\nHaving never engaged the services of a sex worker or massage therapist who performs such duties, I couldn't comment on which were true but will say this, the 'professional' relationship between a therapist and client was breached (at best).\n\nThe number of stars given in this review is based on the therapeutic value of the treatments and the cleanliness of the premises based on what I witnessed viruses the deliberate deception regarding the Reflexology treatment (or lack thereof).\n\nThe text above are facts as I know them but acknowledge that my opinions and interpretations on what I experienced are based on some assumptions and the comparison between two people receiving the same treatment at the same time by two different therapists.\n\nI make no accusations of any kind and I'll allow you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nUPDATE: As requested, we visited at approximately 1330 on Monday 10 Nov 25. Two people initially.",

I get it to a degree with members, but if you’re paying for a one off session… c’mon!!!!\n\nThe Towel Situation\n\nHonestly, this might be the first high end gym I’ve ever been to that doesn’t just hand out towels. I got told no, they wouldn’t lend me one because then they’d have to wash it. Like… really?\n\nAnd if it’s a hygiene thing, surely you’d rather have clean towels in your gym than let someone bring in one that maybe got sand on it at the beach yesterday. I’m all about setting rules, but chill out a little… none step regulations!!!\n\nConclusion\n\nNot to sound like a broken record lol, but man the towels really got to me. I’ve been contemplating all day whether to be a Karen and write this review, and as you can see… I thought it was a good idea.\n\nFor the price, just give out the towels.\n\nWould I come back again I hear you ask? Yes I would (with a sandy towel), although after reading this I may be blacklisted lmao.\n\nOther Stuff\n\nOutside of, you know, what happened with the towels, had a pleasant to good time. Great equipment. Although I did then get told to put my shoes on, which I guess is fair.",

I know that I would grow muscle/fitness very quickly with The Yard's well rounded workout itineraries.\n\nThe equipment feels brand new, with zero wear and tear. While the space is smaller than most gyms, this is offset by a wealth of equipment and great utilisation. I observed the space stress tested earlier in the week and was impressed by how the team navigated it so that all participants had the same experience.\n\nWe were trained by Sam, Bianca, Katie and Courtney - They were all consistently professional, approachable, observant and encouraging. Although... I feel like Sam may push you to the limit a little more often 😅\n\nExtra niceties include: Provided towels, stocked consumables, fruit, infused filtered water, plenty of nearby cafe choices, broad age range, great sound system and bonus exercises to always keep you moving.\n\nThanks so much for having us guys, we are stoked!",

One thing I really appreciated was the private shower setup. It’s clean, spacious, and offers complete privacy, which is rare and really valuable.\n\nI’ll be trying out the yoga classes at Gaya Centre soon, and based on everything else I’ve experienced, I’m sure they’ll be just as impressive.\n\nHighly recommend Gaya Centre Byron Bay to anyone looking for high-quality boxing, fitness, yoga, and recovery all in one place.",

The lockers were also made of rusty metal with creaky hinges, so definitely bring eye masks and ear plugs if you want some quality sleep.\nThe kitchen was absolutely disgusting with dirty dishes everywhere, no dishwashing liquid and overflowing rubbish bins.

It’s a very welcoming place where socializing is at the forefront.\nCustomer service from the staff was good, easy check-ins, check-outs, and I saw the manager interacting with a few guests and it was always very pleasant.\nThe amenities of having a pool and volleyball court, outdoor and indoor seating, decent WiFi, chargers in the social areas, and hammocks were a nice touch.\nI’d come to hangout, but I wouldn’t spend money and stay the night here again… Now for the not-so-great stuff.\nCleanliness 2/10 unfortunately very poor maintenance. It all feels broken down, abused, and grimy. I think there’s a general lack of respect because of how gross things are, that nobody bothers to be the Good Samaritan if everyone else is gross. This goes for the bathrooms, the kitchens, common areas for dining, the pool, and of course the dorm rooms themselves. It’s over-priced for how dirty you feel while staying here. I’d probably prefer to stay in my own pitched tent over the dorm rooms, in the dry season.\nIt is quite a ways away from town, around a 15-20 minute walk doesn’t seem like much but without shade, in direct sun and humid heat during the summer, it’s rough. Especially if you’re backpacking, plan to take an uber or taxi from the bus stop. I wish they offered a bus to/from town like the other hostels in the area do. Bring a bike AND A LOCK if you don’t have a car/ van for transport.\nRandoms are fine, but it does feel a bit odd that anyone from anywhere can come and go, without having a room reserved. I bet many people take advantage of that, which probably adds to how unclean it feels. I didn’t have any bad interactions, but many people are using some form of *medication* so limit your expectations on community behavior.\nThe rooms do not have AC, and I found it to be pretty hard to sleep in with only a ceiling fan and a floor fan while it was so hot and humid at night. Again, the general lack of accountability leads to very dirty rooms.\nIf this place was cleaned from top to bottom, sterilized of grime and given some real TLC, it has the potential to be a much better space. Either more volunteers, more cleaning staff, or more strict security needs to come into play if the prices are to remain what they are.\nI hope to come back and have a better experience, for now it just has memories of some good people ❤️",

I really wanted to enjoy the experience, but was a little turned off by the lack of respect of the caravan from previous tenants. The renovations were obviously done some time ago, and numerous occupants have not cared about the property. The mesh screens have seen better days as they were peeling off the windows. This increased my fear of bugs attacking me at night time and we had to buy bug spray. There were ants everywhere. I know the site owners can't help this, they did leave any bait in the cupboard for occupants to use. We cleaned them up, but by the next morning they had started to make their way back inside. The aluminum blinds are all damaged. Especially the one by the bed. It was hanging by a thread. The bed sheets had a little bit of debris near the bottom which I am hoping is just from the wall chipping off when the bed was made. There was only a large singular pillow, which makes sleeping with 2 people rather difficult to share. The bed was actually extremely comfortable, especially with the fan on during the night. We had a portable stove and water to our caravan which made cooking and cleaning up pleasant. However, I expected that there might be a communal kitchen on site, but there wasn't. The hose to the caravan was leaking a lot too. Might need a new washer. There were a few strings of fairy lights around the caravan, but all of them had flat batteries. The ladies toilet was tidy, but the men's was a mess. There was puke on the footpath in the morning. Again I understand that the camp ground is not responsible for other campers behavior, but keep this in mind when booking.",

Again I understand that the camp ground is not responsible for other campers behavior, but keep this in mind when booking.",

However I think it was quite gross to not get fresh body wash for each new stay  as the option was to reuse a broken pump bottle of body wash and handwash that who knows how many other people have used, the dishes weren’t clean, and the scrubber to do the dishes was filthy, the kitchenette and bathroom was quite “old” and needs a revamp, and for the duty of care for guests there shouldn’t have been mould on the shower curtain or in the vanity. There were cobwebs everywhere and the toilet was leaking. The communal kitchen and lounge area was great but again it needs a deep clean. You can be eco friendly and still hygienic. We enjoyed our stay but it was a bit pricy for the condition of it. Thank you for having us.",

Big shout out to the staff who are the friendliest and easiest to deal with, when I encountered some issues with my booking they fixed it the same day and also offered a refund if I preferred to book somewhere else. Amazing service, needless to say I'll book again if I get a chance.",

          "reviewText": "Drifter Byron Bay – A Bougie Hostel That Feels Like a Boutique Hotel\n\nDrifter is a very bougie “hostel”; it honestly feels more like a boutique hotel. The rooms are beautifully designed, and the décor throughout the social spaces gives off serious Hamptons energy. If you’re a little extra and want somewhere stylish and comfortable to stay in Byron, look no further.\n\nEverything feels fresh, new, and well-organised. The bathrooms and showers are spotless and plentiful, and the beds even have curtains! That’s such a rare touch in Australian hostels, and it makes a world of difference for privacy and comfort.\n\nMy only small gripe would be that the floors in the rooms could use a quick sweep during the day with everyone coming in from the beach, a bit of sand tends to build up. It’s not a big deal, just something to watch out for so your bed doesn’t get sandy. I didn’t mention it to staff because they were already so lovely and helpful, and I didn’t want to be a bother.\n\nThe pool area is super chill, a perfect spot to unwind after a day exploring or doing activities before the Byron nightlife kicks off.\nAll in all, what a place. I highly recommend staying here if you want the perfect mix of comfort, style, and good vibes.",

It's also not clear who is a staying guest that helps out vs who the actual staff that runs the place is. The guests are more long term stayers with their own friend groups, so if you're looking for something more social this isn't it. That was not much of an issue for me, but the cleanliness and insects would be a reason I wouldn't recommend this place.",

The surf can get a rolling sweep across the bay for a long ride or come in pretty scalloped waves perfect for beginners. A day on a long board or a sunset surf session will give you special photos and memories. A lookout provides great views and The Pass Cafe is open for breakfast in season. Full amenities here plus limited National Park parking - but a turning circle zone will help you drop off and pick up. Picture postcard Byron magic.",

The amenities were exceptional – the bathhouse was a standout feature, with its serene ambiance and soothing treatments that left us feeling completely rejuvenated. The accommodation itself was beautifully appointed, with thoughtful touches that made our stay comfortable and luxurious.\n\nEverything was designed to help you unwind, from the cozy beds to the tranquil outdoor spaces. The location was also ideal, giving us easy access to explore Byron while still feeling tucked away in our own private sanctuary. We can’t recommend it enough for anyone looking for a peaceful retreat with first-class amenities. We’ll definitely be back!",

We then did 60 minute bathhouse experience with sea salt scrub shower to wash the oil off was just a small touch that made it more enjoyable. We are from Sydney and have done a bathhouse down here but this was even better, the ambiance and staff cherry on the top. Highly recommend for anyone in Byron",

When we had finished swimming, we all waited for about 20 minutes to use the change room (which was fine). Eventually, we all went in to have a rinse and get changed. We were in there for no more than seven minutes, when a member of the staff aggressively knocked on the door and told us we had been in there too long. We are a family of four, with two small children, who had only been in there for a short time after waiting so much longer. I was honestly disgusted. If the staff want to create an environment supportive of families, then they need to be as well. I won't be returning.",

I can do these exercises in open water or a swimming pool. The warmth, kindness and care that Sally brings to our training makes these water exercises available to everyone no matter your body shape or fitness.

I took an electric frying pan, which was great. There are plenty of places to go andceat out if that is what you prefer. The park is lovely and set out great. The pool is awesome, and great fun, with baby/ small children safe playing and swiming. It has 3 slides. Toilet 🚻 also on the fenced off area. They have 2 play grounds and a jumping pillow which is so much fun for kids of all ages. Its a must stay.",

It is 5/5 for caravans, vans, motorhomes and it is quiet with some shaded areas or open areas which are back from the highway, hence its quiet. The bad reviews are from people renting cabins right on the highway, so yes it's noisy if in a cabin on the highway, who knew lol. So don't get the cheapest cabins, get the ones back from the highway.for me it was great in a campervan for 4 nights, 3 toilets, 3 showers in amenities block and clean, lots of washing machines and dryers in laundry area and two big outdoor kitchens with gas hotplates or gas cooktop with 4 burners. Walk to centre of town, walk to botanic gardens in 10 minutes. Price is lots more than usual showgrounds at $54 night for powered site but it is the normal going rate in Coffs Harbour with other van parks. I had an excellent stay and will definitely go back again. 5 out of 5 stars.",

To make matters worse, there were disturbances with domestic arguments and police involvement, making it difficult to get a restful night's sleep. We were falsely accused of being loud and obnoxious when it was actually the residents of the neighboring cabin who were causing disturbances. Lastly, I noted a security concern in the female bathroom. A hole in the mesh screen, which could pose a serious risk to safety and privacy. The layout of the men's bathroom was also problematic, as the shower area is located directly across from the reception office, again creating an uncomfortable feeling of being monitored while using the facilities. This design flaw negatively impacts the overall experience and undermines our expectations of privacy in a shared bathroom setting. The conditions of the bathroom were unsanitary, with stains on the doors and walls, which was disappointing given the price of the stay. Overall it was a very disappointing experience for the both of us.",

No house keeping to give you fresh towels or restock toilet paper etc. I can’t imagine staying there for weeks. Had to pay for wifi (not included), beach towels and the parking lot is atrocious. If you are staying near main reception, you share the carpark with in and out visitors at all hours from events at Aanuka beach house and the other bar there. It’s tiny, narrow spots, worried about if someone is going to hit your car with the amount of tourists there. One night we had to park on the street in the rain, as a guest because it was full. Definitely overpriced and over rated online. It wasn’t all bad, we had a great time, however definitely spent way too much for what you get. Tried the breakfast buffet and that wasn’t included, $40 per person per day so went elsewhere. Our cabin had a glass roof in the bathroom that hadn’t been cleaned for a good while either. It was so busy and wasn’t even school holidays or Christmas time. I would avoid during the holiday period!! Cabin was also down the back right next to the road but we were told it was nice and quiet.",

The vanity needs repair and a paint job.\n\nThe mattress was very hard.\n\nNo USB port in that executive room, room needs updating.\n\nThe service in the reception area and dining was amazing. The food was fabulous!!! Had attitude from a female staff in the bar, husband felt as though he was bothering her.",

          "reviewText": "We are staying 2 nights here at the Pacific's Bay Resort and really happy with the room we chose. We on the 6th floor in the 1 bedroom apartment overlooking the Golf Course. Check in at the reception desk was easy and gave us a map of where to park and how to get to our room. Ok parking was an issue underneath as there was a conference on so many cars, but we did get a park underneath luckily, otherwise there is an outside car park further up and abit of a walk back down to the lifts. Our room is lovely and clean, with a lovely view over the the water and Golf Course. Huge balcony and is very spacious inside. The apartment has a spacious bedroom with ensuite thats seperate to the lounge, dining and kitchen. The bedroom has plenty of storage with built in wardrobes with glass sliding mirrored doors, also has a safe. There is also a large TV mounted on the wall, as well as 1 in the lounge room. Also has its own laundry with washing machine and dryer too which is handy for the longer stays. There is good Airconditioning in both rooms too. Has a King bed, which is so comfortable, we both had a fabulous night sleep and there was no noise from the highway at all. Kitchen is modern and has everything, has a stove with oven, microwave, has a normal size fridge, kettle, toaster, cups, saucers, plates, cutlery, wine glasses etc, just look and you will find. Love this apartment but our only gripe was for us seniors with bad knees and ankles was that the shower is in the bath tub, and its quite a big step over, we  didn't realise this when we booked. So for those of you who are not as agile anymore this could be a safety issue  getting in and out this bath  especially when your wet. Now it does have a large handle on the wall to hold on too which is very handy, so I suggest sit on the edge of the bath and swing your legs around. The resort itself has a couple of swimming pools by the looks and is only a short 5 to 7 minute drive into town. We have really loved this apartment and yes we would definitely stay here again but maybe for abit longer next time to explore more of this lovely Resort ( will bring our Golf Clubs next time too ) plus to explore more of the Coffs Harbour area and its surrounding regions like Sawtell, which is only a 15 minute drive up the road and what a lovely little town it is. Just loved our time here, would recommend to anyone",

(Previous stayer / resort itself?) but it doesn’t matter, as the rooms should be inspected before and after. I don’t understand why?? Inside the microwave there are brown spots probably of old food or drinks idk it’s gross. The tv has no remote and when we asked for one they couldn’t provide to give us a damn remote. The food at the restaurant it’s ok, not a lot of choice honestly they could put a bit more effort but I have to say that it’s really pretty the inside with a beautiful view, the waitresses are kind. Overall honestly I don’t think I would come back tho… and it’s a shame because the outside it’s stunning!",

I laughed when I saw the room, yes it was older and had imperfections but it was fine. The room was clean, comfortable furnishings, and a lovely verandah overlooking a little rainforest area.

In terms of accessability the room was a bit small for a wheelchair, having said that it was conveniently located near the elevators. They did arrange a shower chair for me, there were grab rails located all around the bathroom. The reason for the poor review is around the lack of house keeping, we went out for the day and when we returned the room had not been made up. When we enquired about it we were told, we don't have house keeping for stays under 15 days, they'll come and change the sheets in 8 days. Very dissapointing service for a \"Resort\", there are no phones in thr room and mobile service is patchy to say the best.",

We arrived with open minds after seeing mixed reviews, and we are so glad we did! If you take a moment to read the resort's clear descriptions (especially regarding room types and the natural setting), you are truly in for a magnificent treat. We found that managing expectations is key, and if you do encounter a minor hiccup, the staff are solution-oriented and incredibly responsive—just speak up nicely!\n\n🏡 The Apartment & The Unplugged Vibe (5/5)\n\nOur apartment was absolute bliss and a beautiful sanctuary! It was stylishly decorated and fully equipped with everything needed. Though there were two lovely large TVs, we happily neglected them in favor of the view—this is definitely the place to unplug and enjoy the peace.\n\nThoughtful Service: They perfectly accommodated our request for a room near the elevator due to health needs. When we realized our initial room lacked the requested spa bath, the team was incredible, moving us to the perfect new room on the same floor in less than five minutes!\n\nModern Communication: There are no room phones, which we loved for the disconnect, but the SMS system is secure, modern, and efficient for check-in and quick queries.\n\n🦁 Wildlife & Immaculate Grounds\n\nWelcome to your real-life nature documentary! The grounds are beautifully kept and brimming with charming wildlife:\n\nLocal Residents: The water dragons are curious but respectful neighbors (truly, they are more scared of you!). We enjoyed watching the cheeky seagulls and the massive, beautiful koi in the pond.\n\nNature Drama: We heard the hilarious (if slightly tragic) tale that the koi population shrank recently thanks to a local pelican who decided on an impromptu sushi diet—nature at its boldest!\n\n🍽️ The Dining Experience: A Tale of Two Chefs 🍕\n\nThe restaurant setting is undeniably gorgeous, boasting fantastic views just a short walk away. However, we found the dining experience to be a bit of a rollercoaster:\n\nThe Highs: Our first breakfast was superb—fresh fruit, fluffy pancakes, and perfectly cooked eggs.\n\nThe Lows: Later in the week, it felt like a completely different kitchen team. The breakfast quality dipped significantly (rubbery eggs and \"vintage\" fruit). We survived happily on the tasty, if slightly smaller, pikelets from the pancake machine!\n\nThe \"Pizza Surprise\": This was our only true letdown. We were dressed up for a special mother-daughter Friday night, expecting the full menu as advertised. Instead, we were told upon arrival that it was strictly Pizza Only. This communication hiccup meant we had to scramble to find a fine-dining alternative late on a Friday evening.\n\n🏊‍♀️ The Pool Circuit & Fun-ctionality!\n\nThree Pools, One Favourite: We loved having a \"Pool Circuit\" to explore. Our favourite was the Golf Kiosk Pool—a large, peaceful social hub complete with a bar/kiosk.\n\nThe Staff's Secret Superpower: The team doubled as a rescue service! My daughter had a magical experience with saving a dragonfly and earlier, saved over thirty tiny lady beetles near the Hillside Pool (great for lap swimming!). We also loved hearing about the staff saving a baby bird.\n\n🎾 Active Fun & Pampering\n\nSports & Games: The resort offers an excellent golf course, ample tennis/basketball courts, and a Games Deck with a pool table for some competitive fun.\n\nWellness: Skip the standard gym (onsite) and embrace the scenic running paths that wind along the beachfront. Best of all, the on-site, separately-owned Day Spa is a slice of heaven—we fell asleep during our hot stone massages!\n\nFinal Word: If you are seeking a sterile city hotel, look elsewhere. But if you desire a truly relaxing, nature-immersed getaway with a team that goes above and beyond (and maybe a little animal rescue on the side!), then book here! We'll certainly be back when we can steal some time away again!",

A couple of them stayed up till just before midnight talking and laughing which made getting to sleep difficult. Then another said bro was up at 4am for work. When he left his dog started yapping for at least 15 after. There goes any chance you might have of getting a good nights rest.\n\nWhen I was setting up my tent yesterday, another bro decided to fly past on his dirt bike and gun the throttle right where I was. Why? Nonsense like this totally detracts from the camp experience.\n\nFurther, the owner sends you a lengthy sms with all the rules when you book. One such rule is noise after 10pm. Cool story I guess. If he can’t enforce the rules with the long stayers, what’s the point exactly?\n\nApart from the above, the shower was decent. However the kitchen was a mess and the fridge! Jesus, don’t look in there. Looked to be rotten fruit and veg in the chiller section.\n\nHope this helps anybody thinking about staying here! Cheers",

Close to Coffs Harbour (15min) Coramba Hotel 5 minutes up the road, good food and swimming across the road. Camp kitchen offered great facilities, toilet, oven fridge, microwave, kettle, toaster, hot water to wash dishes. Quite clean and tidy. Will definitely be back again. Be respectful and clean up after yourself so this affordable camping area continues👍\nPS, this was an old quarry area and extremely difficult to put tent pegs in the ground🙈",

Completely happy with lashes and colour of brows too. Helpful tips at the end for longevity of colour and a delicious chai tea to finish. Perfectly chilled, thank you",
