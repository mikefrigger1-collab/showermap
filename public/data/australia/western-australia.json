There is no lighting of this area after dark so it can easily be missed.\nPrices are low ($7) however the facilities reflect that price.\nChanging rooms are poor with no cubicles and a floor that is constantly wet.\nAlso there are no locker facilities available and you have to either carry your stuff poolside or trust your things will be safe in the 'changing room'.\nThe pools themselves are mostly fine although POORLY MANAGED as lifeguards are few and far between. Lanes are limited with a lot of slower swimmers and few mid speed lanes. No obvious lane directions led to confusion, with some lanes being taken up by just two people going back and forth (no making room for three or more to share).\nThe pool itself was clean and had no problem with it.\nThere is a general lack of administration on rules and other things, it seemed to me like I could have just walked in without paying.\nNot sure why this is a public pool as it feels more like a high school pool. I hope in future UWA takes better management of the facilities as there is so much potential to make the facilities applicable for public use.",

I came to swim laps and it’s actually an amazing pool—the water temp is great, the pool is spotless, and the other swimmers/staff were friendly. The locker rooms are clean, but small, and most people keep their bags outside by the pool. It’s also easily accessible via the free Purple CAT bus (it’s a one way loop, so just make sure you know when the next bus is arriving).\n\nDocking one star bc although the pool is great, the extremely limited public swim hours make this pool almost useless for anyone who’s not near the campus or who has other things to do (weekdays: 6-8:30am, 11:30-2pm, 6:30-8pm and weekends: 12-2pm).\n\nOverall, great pool, but sadly one that I won’t be visiting again due to the limited lap swimming schedule. Lucky the Beatty Park pool is also amazing and has much more flexible hours.",

Some showers have doors on them for a little privacy others have nothing for privacy. There are plenty of toilets in working order but sometimes they are out of toilet paper early in the morning/late at night. It would be really great if they got lockers for the ladies change room! As of now, you take your belongings to the pool deck while you swim.\n\nThe pool is usually pretty busy at most times of the day especially in spring and summer, but swimmers make room for you in their lanes if you ask nicely. I like that they are open late into the evening.",

I really like the group fitness classes — there’s a huge variety, including yoga, Pilates, cycle, and high-intensity workouts, all led by motivating instructors who know how to keep sessions engaging. The change rooms and facilities are always tidy, and parking is convenient with plenty of spaces close to the entrance.\n\nThe staff are what really make Beatty Park Leisure Centre special. They’re friendly, approachable, and always happy to help, whether it’s answering questions about memberships, assisting kids with swimming lessons, or simply offering a smile at reception. You can tell they genuinely care about creating a positive experience for everyone.\n\nIf you’re in Perth and looking for a high-quality leisure centre with swimming pools, a gym, group fitness, and family-friendly facilities, I can’t recommend Beatty Park Leisure Centre enough.

I am so upset because she just said without checking first and I am swimming everyday in Cannington leisureplex. My complain is the manner. Why did she said without check the pool?. This is public service area and she should accept that complain and check that. I was waiting 20 minutes in walking line, but she didn’t check temperature in 25m pool. It should prepare well for pool before the guest is coming.\n\nShe should know where she is working for. And Leisureplex have to make checking list before and after operation hours.",

As a paying customer, I was unable to use these services that I had paid for.\n\nNow that these facilities have finally reopened, I have been following the new rule of exchanging for a wristband at the service desk to access the spa area. However, I have observed a glaring inconsistency in the enforcement of this policy. On a daily basis, I notice that more than half of the users in the spa area are either not wearing a wristband at all or are wearing wristbands of a different color, with no staff members present to manage or question this.\n\nThis situation is both frustrating and unfair. It creates a feeling of being penalized for being a rule-abiding member.

Absolutely not relaxing and very disappointed considering we paid for this. A life guard explained they can’t stop swimmers going in the area, that you pay for use of the blow up not the lazy river as it indicates online. So we took a break for lunch while the swimming lesson was on, and when we went to get the inflatables they had been taken my other older kids. Even though we had the arm bands on and no one else did, there was zero interest in trying to help us get the inflatables back for our use. Understand the lifeguards have other more important things to do than patrol inflatables - but we were charged so much on-top of entrance fee and unable to use our items!!! I don’t recommend, really wanted it to be good but it’s not well organised or helpful when there is a problem.",

          "reviewText": "I've been coming to the Terry Tyzack centre for probably a decade now. I have a full membership but I basically just use the 50m lap pool outside.\nI'm astonished by the negative reviews this centre receives occasionally. In my experience I find the staff to be professional, polite and courteous - never any issues there. Whenever I've raised a concern it's been dealt with patiently and appropriately.\nThe facilities here are all very good. Well maintained and quite good quality. Any comments about cleanliness or occasional service shutdowns - you have to remember, this place probably handles 1000s of human beings per week. That HAS to take a toll on equipment and machinery, no?\nYes, on occasion, the sauna or spa will be shutdown for cleaning and maintenance. This is normal and necessary. Complaining about it only reveals a lack of insight into facility management.\nContrary to other reviewers, there are indeed 3 separate washrooms for males and females.\nThe \"flagship\" washroom is located near the indoor pools and I suspect it receives the most use. I only use the male washroom, but it has 4(5?) showers, and adequate toileting. The second tier washroom is located in the corridor near the physiotherapy and gym. Again, 3 showers, adequate toilets. The third (and probably least used) washroom is accessed from the external pool area and has 3 showers and adequate toileting. That's a total of 10 showers and about 8 sit down toilets.\nRegarding swimming times and availability, you have to use common sense. If you come during peak usage time, many lanes are full and there will be many lanes reserved, because this is a functional way that swimming centres everywhere operate. It's not a flaw of this centre specifically. If you want to swim with no-one around, come when it's early, come when it's late, come when the weather is crappy and no-one else wants to swim (I'm sharing all my secrets). On this note, practice swimming politeness. Don't be an arrogant swimmer swimming \"on top\" of slower swimmers. Don't be a clueless swimmer and swim super slow in the fast lane. It's easy to wait a couple moments at the end of your lap for someone faster to pass you, then swim at your own happy pace behind them.\nA special shout-out to the cleaners at this centre, by the way. The un-sung heroes of large scale facilities like this. I have seen people complain about the lack of cleanliness and after 10 years I can attest to the excellent work the cleaners do. Remember, some humans are responsible and clean up after themselves, but it is commonplace for people to come and use a facility, then leave their rubbish (of whatever kind) for \"someone else\" to clean up.\nI would say the \"flagship\" washrooms get the messiest, because they are the most popular. Cleaners clean them neatly, then a bunch of customers come through - and completely mess them up again. It's normal. It's not a failing of the centre. If you find something messy or dirty...pick it up and put it in the bin! Or, politely inform the staff at reception who will notify the cleaners, who will come and clean things up. Again.\nLastly I've noticed remarks about staff members and racism. I highly doubt this. I find all the staff at this centre to be professional and polite. They are \"frontline\" staff, and as such they deal with customers all day, everyday, the good and the bad. Being in customer service is one of the hardest jobs there is I reckon. Dealing with such a broad customer base - parents, carers with ability-impaired clients, teenagers, the elderly, etc etc. All day everyday. If patience is lost on occasion, I wouldn't take it personally. I always try to approach my interactions with people in customer service from a perspective of \"how can I make their day a little easier in this moment\".\nAnyway. Terry Tyzack is a great place, and it's worth whatever membership you're paying. Have a good one.",

The gym is spacious, well-lit, and fully equipped with a wide range of machines, free weights, cardio equipment, and functional training areas. Whether you’re focused on building strength, improving endurance, or just maintaining general fitness, this place has everything you need.\n\nAll the equipment is in excellent condition and clearly well-maintained. I never had to wait long for a machine, and everything was laid out thoughtfully to avoid overcrowding, even during busy hours. I also appreciated the dedicated mobility and stretching zone — a rare find that makes recovery and warm-ups far more comfortable.\n\nOne of the best aspects is the 24/7 access, which gives total flexibility to fit workouts around a busy schedule. Whether it’s early morning, late evening, or in between appointments, you can pop in whenever suits you. The access system works smoothly and the environment feels secure and safe at all hours.\n\nThe change rooms are clean, with good water pressure in the showers, well-stocked facilities, and secure lockers available for personal belongings.\n\nAnd finally, the location couldn’t be better — right on Murray Street in the heart of Perth’s CBD. It’s perfect for locals, office workers, or even travelers who want to stay active while in town.\n\nOverall, a top-tier gym experience with excellent equipment, great atmosphere, and unbeatable convenience.

Founded in 2002 in Minnesota, USA, the brand has rapidly expanded to over 5,000 clubs in more than 30 countries, serving millions of members across the globe. Whether you're in New York, Tokyo, London, or Singapore, chances are you’re never far from an Anytime Fitness club.\n\nAt the heart of the brand is its core promise: convenience, community, and personalized fitness. Unlike traditional gyms, Anytime Fitness stands out by offering members 24/7 access, 365 days a year. This means you can work out on your own schedule—early morning, late at night, or even during holidays—using a secure access key. For those with demanding jobs, unconventional schedules, or a need for flexibility, this feature alone makes Anytime Fitness incredibly appealing.\n\nEach club is independently owned and operated, yet they all maintain a standardized level of quality. Facilities typically include a well-equipped space with cardio machines, strength training equipment, free weights, and functional training zones. Many clubs also offer private restrooms, showers, and lockers, emphasizing comfort and cleanliness.\n\nAnother key advantage is the global access. Members of any Anytime Fitness club can access all other clubs worldwide at no additional cost. This is a huge plus for frequent travelers, remote workers, or anyone who wants to maintain consistency in their fitness routine across locations.\n\nMore than just a place to exercise, Anytime Fitness fosters a strong sense of community. Many clubs are smaller than big-box gyms, which allows for more personalized service and a friendly, neighborhood vibe. Staff often know members by name, and there’s a culture of mutual encouragement. Clubs regularly organize fitness challenges, group training, workshops, and social events, creating opportunities for members to connect beyond workouts.\n\nProfessional support is readily available. Certified personal trainers offer one-on-one sessions tailored to individual goals—whether it's weight loss, strength building, injury recovery, or general wellness. In addition, the Anytime Fitness app provides virtual coaching, workout tracking, and customized programs for those who prefer to train independently.\n\nOne of the brand’s missions is to make fitness accessible to everyone, regardless of age or fitness level. Many clubs welcome seniors, teens, and beginners, and offer adaptive workouts to suit different needs. The atmosphere is non-intimidating and inclusive, making it easier for newcomers to feel comfortable.\n\nIn conclusion, Anytime Fitness is more than just a gym—it’s a global movement that empowers individuals to take charge of their health on their own terms. With its 24/7 accessibility, community-driven environment, professional support, and worldwide reach, it’s a trusted choice for people seeking a flexible, supportive, and effective fitness solution.",

Whether you’re an early riser, a night owl, or someone squeezing in a workout between shifts, the flexibility of being able to train at any time is one of the brand’s biggest advantages.\n\nEach Anytime Fitness location typically features a clean, well-maintained space with a modern layout. The equipment is up-to-date and covers a wide range of fitness needs, including free weights, strength machines, cardio gear, and functional training zones. Whether you’re into weightlifting, circuit training, or just hopping on a treadmill, there’s something here for every fitness level.\n\nOne of the best things about Anytime Fitness is its global access. Once you're a member, you can use any location worldwide, which is perfect for frequent travelers. The gym’s key fob system allows secure, hassle-free entry even when staff are not present.\n\nThe atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, making it especially good for beginners or those who may feel intimidated in larger, more intense gym environments. The crowd is usually a mix of regular gym-goers, working professionals, and newcomers, and the vibe is casual but respectful.

The brand Technogym features heavily here and they definitely make quality machines - very intuitive to use, feel great and are true to weight. The gym is CLEAN! Can’t overstate this, the managers manage to keep this gym smelling and looking great every day time I’ve been in which is just such a bonus compared to almost every other gym I’ve been to in the past; the gym is just kept really well. The change rooms/toilets have private lockers available for rent and are clean and very spacious! Suitable for anyone to prep for the workday/wind down from the work day.\n\nThe team are also fantastic. Jireh and Yvonne were the two managers that I met and they were both so helpful and friendly. They answered all my questions during the workout about machines, form and more. They were so helpful with the sign up process and took me on a tour around the gym to help me familiarise myself with the equipment. The culture this team are building is great - strict cleanliness policies as well as a policed entry so that people aren’t sneaking friends in etc. I met both the owners Don and Fabian from the Track Willetton and they are just upstanding people who know how to run a good business. The price is incredibly reasonable given the quality of the gym, it’s no wonder that so many people have signed up already just a couple of days after opening.\n\nIf you’re training at another gym in the city - do yourself a favour and come here instead.",

When I joined, it looked to be in a state of disarray with old equipment and perienally empty vending machines but ever since the new owners took over the whole place has transformed. Wayne has put so much effort into upgrading the whole place since taking over including a state of the art motion detection water fountain, brand new Technogym equipment and even little formal touches like a Dyson hairdryer in the showers.\n\nSabrina is a wonderful manager. Warm, friendly and welcoming towards all members. My favorite thing about this place is the non-judgemental vibe you get from everyone there. At no point have I ever felt uncomfortable about being judged by my peers whenever I'm here. There's another girl whose name I don't know I've seen in the office before the new owners took over and she was also extremely helpful.\n\nI've been to a few Plus Fitness franchises so far like North Perth (obviously), Mount Lawley and Wembley but I am yet to come across one as good as this.",

The toilet block was very far from any parking, so very difficult to access with the wheelchair… make sure you are not desperate to go when you visit! The building is very old and could have been interesting had it been looked after, but sadly it has been neglected terribly. The facilities were basic, and not well equipped at all. No toilet paper. Dirty and smelly. No sanitary bins in the cubicles. The disabled toilet was IN the ladies’, so a male relative had to go in to the ladies toilet section to assist the wheelchair user. The soap was unreachable for the wheelchair user, but don’t worry, this poor design isn’t based on ableism… another lady who was short also needed to ask a complete stranger to reach her some soap! The only good thing about this toilet block is leaving it and never returning.",

When you are ready, meander back through a line of long, high green strips alongside the beach that join up a few small parks.

There was a netted off area for swimming and lots of sandbanks for sandcastle building.\nI did not find it hard to park, but don't park behind the golf club, it's not safe to run across the golf course.

The site was lovely and spacious and the grass was beautiful, lush and green, coming out of winter (early November). We overlooked the playground, which was clean and fenced, perfect for our 5 year old.  The toilet block was clean and reasonably modern, with a touch pad lock. The camp kitchen was amazing, well equipped and had a tv. The location was very convenient, a short walk to restaurants at Dolphin Quay and into town. Our friends stayed in a two bedroom cabin and were very happy with it. The kitchen was well equipped and the outside lounge area was perfect for their kids, also overlooking the playground. The park is dog friendly and its a short walk to the beach and dog beach. The only downside was the area it is in. There were police sirens day and night and lots of homeless people hanging around the IGA. This is totally out of the control of the park owners/managers, but would perhaps prevent us from returning.",

Yes it is close to the airport but it didn't bother us or seem to bother anyone else one bit. Sites are spacious and couldn't see why any caravan or vehicle wouldn't fit. I would highly recommend and would definitely use this park again if I came back to Perth. Thanks John for an awesome stay!",

The toilet/ shower block looks new, lovely hot shower and cleaner does great job! Yes you are near the airport so there are planes flying over you, but the noise didn’t bother us at all. Very good price compared to others we looked at in Perth. 10 minute walk from train station. What more do you need?",

It's an older campground with simple amenities. With that in mind, my stay (with my 10 year old) was excellent and great value for money. The staff are the loveliest, and the place was spotlessly clean.\n\nOur cabin had 2 beds and they were nicely made with comfortable mattresses, bedding and lots of pillows. There were warm fluffy blankets in the wardrobe and we loved them. The kitchen was well equipped, much better than I thought. There was ample crockery, plenty of pots and pans, and all the utensils I needed.\nThe unit doesn't have a full oven (it has a hob and microwave) so i used the shared Camp Kitchen and was impressed - great oven, all the utensils I could ever need, and very clean.\n\nThe shared bathrooms which are adjacent to the cabin I stayed in were perfectly adequate and very clean all the time.\n\nThe swimming pool is FREEZING. I can't work out how it was so cold but it did not stop children swimming in it. The loungers around the pool were great for me and other parents to lie in and supervise. It was great to see staff pass by every half hour and check to make sure everything was okay in the pool area.\n\nOne unexpected highlight was the DVD library in the games room. Our cabin had a DVD player and my child had never seen a DVD in real life. We watched a few movies and really enjoyed the experience - its a great range of DVDs. Plus I found a good book in the collection to read.\n\nIt's worth noting that the park has quite a lot of permanent residents in caravans with lean-tos. They were friendly and the park was quiet. It was a surprise, I hadn't seen that before, but it was not a problem. We slept well and heard nothing in the night. There is plenty of car parking.\n\nI loved my get away to Big4 Midland and will be back. As long as future visitors remember it is a 'Classic' park, it should meet all your expectations. Being a 'Classic' it is great value for money! We paid $118 per night in the peak school holiday period and it was totally worth it.",

Out of all the caravan parks we've stayed at this was the most expensive but nowhere near as good of amenities/things to offer. The pool says closed after dark which is fair however we walked over at 5.30pm still daylight and the pools locked, the games room has a pool table & ping-pong table but you haveto get the stuff from reception which once again closes at 5pm, the playground has no seating for adults around, the swings and flying fox has been taken out aswell. In a toilet block there's only 3 toilets which everytime I went was either out of toilet paper or the paper was stuck- hubby said had great shower pressure tho. Camp kitchen is very small in comparison. Also being woken up at 7am in the morning to a tree chipper is a great way to start the day- NOT.",

Location good, park overall nice, my main issue was the camp kitchen, firstly doesn’t open until 7am, hmmm 7:10 rolls around and it’s casually open, however not cleaned. Food scrapes everywhere, tables dirty. For the amount of money charged for a site, to then wait for a camp kitchen to open?! You would think it would be cleaned before it’s open, otherwise why lock it! We have been traveling WA for 4 weeks and this is the first locked one and the most unclean one.\nAlso WiFi doesn’t work.",

The first thing I noticed was a pile of rubbish and furniture on the slab across from our room. I parked my car and walked up the decking, noticing that it was rotten and broken in parts, leading up to the front door, and the stair rail was also rotten and loose. I had my ageing parents come to visit us, and my dad nearly fell over on the broken parts of the decking. Upon opening the front door, all I could smell was smoke and stale air, like the room hadn’t been aired out after the previous guests left. The unit was basically clean, but it didn’t look like it had been thoroughly cleaned after the last check-out. For a room with one double bed and a bunk that sleeps three, there were only four pillows, no extra bedding in the cupboards, and no extra blankets anywhere. I went to collect my husband and children from sport and returned. When I tried to put something in the pantry, I found a beanie which I thought was odd. I checked it and saw cigarettes inside; upon further inspection, I found drug paraphernalia and a significant amount of marijuana. I considered calling the police but decided to leave it to the front office. I went over and couldn’t find anyone, so I called the after-hours number and got no reply, so I decided to wait until morning.\nWe had planned to cook a BBQ dinner because many families from our son’s baseball club were staying there, and we thought it would be a great evening for the kids to bond. However, the BBQs were broken and unusable. That evening, my husband tried to lock the front door, but the lock kept turning in the handle, and he couldn’t lock it from inside, so he had to lock it from outside with the key. The next morning, we had to go out the back door to unlock the front door. The floor in the shower felt like it was collapsing, and the tiles around it were sinking. Honestly, we pay the same price for more nights at Karrinyup Waters Resort, where it’s clean, well-maintained, and comfortable. We didn’t feel that way there—the beds felt like we’d be bitten all night and need updating. We won’t stay there again. The staff were great and apologetic when I raised my concerns. While I understand there are new owners, the lawns hadn’t been mowed in what seemed like months, the units need definite updating and a really good clean.\nAnother family I spoke to who had a little baby were told that there was no cot for the baby and they would have to go out and buy their own.  When you offer a service you need to deliver.",

          "reviewText": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nOne of the best campgrounds near Perth – clean, quiet, and perfect for beginners or seasoned campers!\n\nWe stayed at Discovery Hill Campground in Beelu National Park and were blown away by how well-maintained, peaceful, and comfortable it was. It’s just under an hour from Perth, but you feel like you’ve completely escaped into the bush.\n\n🛁 Facilities are excellent – hot showers, clean long-drop toilets, and drinking water available on-site.\n🍳 The communal kitchen is fantastic – two gas barbecues, a sink with running water, fridge, prep benches, and plenty of space to cook and relax.\n🔥 Fire pits are everywhere! Almost every corner of the site has one, and they’re perfect for cold nights (check fire season restrictions).\n📶 Strong 5G signal throughout the area – we were surprised how good the internet was for such a remote-feeling location!\n\nThe campground is surrounded by jarrah and marri trees, giving it a true bush feel. We saw kangaroos at sunrise and heard kookaburras every morning. It’s incredibly peaceful and spacious, with well-separated sites for privacy.\n\nIf you’re new to camping and want to try it out before investing in gear or heading somewhere remote, this is the ideal beginner-friendly location. You still get the full outdoor experience but with comforts that make it easy and enjoyable.\n\n🙌 Also, make sure to say hello to Mark, the campground caretaker – he’s a legend! Friendly, helpful, and keeps everything running smoothly. He even gave us tips on the best walking trails.\n\n🥾 Walking and hiking options nearby are amazing:\n•\tA short walk from the campground leads to Lake O’Connor, with stunning views over the hills and plenty of birdlife.\n•\tYou’re right near parts of the Bibbulmun Track – you can do day hikes to Kalamunda, or even link up with longer trails toward Albany.\n•\tThere are also short loop trails around the park if you’re just after a gentle walk.\n\nThis place is a real gem for solo campers, couples, and families alike. Peaceful nights, starry skies, friendly vibe, and a great mix of nature and convenience.\n\nWe saw kangaroos at dawn, enjoyed bushwalks during the day, and had a peaceful night under the stars. Whether you’re a family, a solo adventurer, or a first-time camper looking to try it out, Discovery Hill is a hidden gem. We’ll definitely be back!",

Great for camping if you have kids or little ones and it’s just up the road from the Mundaring Weir Hotel, CY O’Connor lookout and the Dam. Plus no park fees payable except for camping fees. Showers and toilets available as well as a camp kitchen with fridge! Campsites 1 to 8 are better as they look out toward the trees although sites 7 and 8 are close to the camp kitchen. Don’t rely on the mud map on the website, it is really not to scale! We were on site 11 and site 10 was literally less than 5 steps away from us. Use the lookout near the campsite (on mud map) for a nice brekky area if the camp kitchen gets too crowded. Campground backs onto the Bib Track so it’s convenient for walkers and hikers. There are camp hosts there in the caravan at the entrance to sign you in and they have a trolley to help you move your camping gear to your site. There is absolutely no drive through for vehicles. I found this campsite nice but not private enough but may return to short one or two night stays and NOT during the school holidays! That being said the campers were pretty considerate when we were there and all was pretty much silent around 9.40pm but this could be our unique experience so don’t rely fully on it! :)",

There’s a kitchen area with an electric kettle, toaster, fridge and freezer, and two park-style gas BBQs. Makes for a simple camping trip and I found the grounds and facilities well-kept and clean. Campfires allowed in concrete fire pits when there are no bans. I brought my own firewood but the camp hosts had bags of jarrah for sale. Perfect camping option for families and even younger children. You can’t drive directly to the campsite so if you have a lot of stuff consider bringing a wheelbarrow or cart to help tote your gear from the car park. Otherwise it’s not too far to carry things if you pack relatively light.",

The camping is self contained only, there is no electric hookup available and generators are only allowed on tarmac pitches. That said, there are many beautiful walks, treetop adventure ground, cave walks and Kangaroos everywhere! The price is fairly hefty considering the lack of power, etc and there is a national park fee on top of that. This is made up for by the park facilities that are available, including the Yanchep Inn which is a short walk from the campground. The camp hosts are very helpful and there is a fire pit which is lit each evening, season permitting, and is a central meeting place for camp visitors. The kitchen facilities are clean and plentiful, two barbecues, washing up sinks with hot water and large covered seating area also make this a great social point. The toilet block has hot showers and well serviced disabled toilet, all cleaned daily between 10:00 and 11:00. Finally, the Gravity Discovery Center is less than half an hour away and is a great visit for children and adults alike.",

Syd's rapid is a nice spot for a walk. The only problem is that the gate requires a code for access but it's only provide it by phone during office hours, and I did my booking on a Saturday. Lucky I saw a volunteer after few hours I was on the park. Would definitely recommend.",

Her working days overlapped with my check-out days, and she was so irritating, she would drain my energy within minutes.) They ignored my greetings, didn't even explain anything about the hostel, and just demanded in a strong tone, \"Pay your deposit!!\" However, I never got my deposit back, and as soon as I arrived at the room, it was just filthy. It was cold that day, but there was no air conditioning. The futon was as thin as a towel blanket. There were no windows in the four-person room, and it was dark, like midnight, even though it was daytime. There was a vent, but the room was full of dust and mold, making it an unbearable environment. If I had stayed there a few more days, I would have had a nervous breakdown.  My roommate, a large black woman, was racist. She treated me as if I, an Japanese, were not even human. Furthermore, during my stay at the hostel, I was persistently stalked by a Korean man, which shocked me and made me feel unsafe. I asked the reception to change my room, but they completely ignored my request. I can't believe it. There's also a nightclub nearby, which makes it very noisy at night, the washing machine is coin-operated despite being modern, and the toilets are only open between 8am and 9am! Who would want to live in a hostel like this? At the very least, I'll never use this hostel again‼️",

The whole place feels like it hasn't seen an update since the late 90s — and that includes the facilities, the furniture, and definitely the Wi-Fi.\n\nSpeaking of Wi-Fi, don't expect to stream, scroll, or even load a basic webpage from your room. The signal is so weak it practically vanishes unless you’re standing outside in the courtyard, which ironically has the best internet reception. Because nothing says “modern travel” like huddling outdoors for a signal in 2025.\n\nThe rooms are cramped, the beds creak with every breath, and the \"view\" is… well, just don't expect one. A few of the taps and showers are broken or barely functioning, and everything from the toilets to the kitchen appliances screams \"budget hostel, circa 1997.\"\n\nOh, and let’s talk about the key situation.

          "reviewText": "If you're nostalgic for the good old days of Windows 95, dial-up internet, and questionable plumbing, then this backpackers might be right up your alley. The whole place feels like it hasn't seen an update since the late 90s — and that includes the facilities, the furniture, and definitely the Wi-Fi.\n\nSpeaking of Wi-Fi, don't expect to stream, scroll, or even load a basic webpage from your room. The signal is so weak it practically vanishes unless you’re standing outside in the courtyard, which ironically has the best internet reception. Because nothing says “modern travel” like huddling outdoors for a signal in 2025.\n\nThe rooms are cramped, the beds creak with every breath, and the \"view\" is… well, just don't expect one. A few of the taps and showers are broken or barely functioning, and everything from the toilets to the kitchen appliances screams \"budget hostel, circa 1997.\"\n\nOh, and let’s talk about the key situation. Yes, an actual physical key (remember those?). No keycards here — just old-school metal and a $40 deposit for something that probably cost $2 to cut at the hardware store.\n\nThe staff were nice enough, and the location is decent with transport nearby — but that's about where the praise ends.

There is a common room that is generally clean because there is a $20 deposit system: if you don’t wash or dry your dishes, your deposit is automatically taken. This encourages everyone to keep the place tidy.\n\nThe common area is spacious, with a pool table, a TV and comfortable leather couches. There is also a separate gaming room with an Xbox that you can use anytime. The dining area has around twenty chairs with several small tables and three large tables for groups. Another cosy pool-table corner is available as well, with soft velvet couches everywhere.\n\nThe hostel is calm and respectful. After 10 PM, noise is not allowed, which is perfect for people who work and need good sleep. From 10 PM to 8 AM, the rule is silence, and everyone respects it.\n\nShowers are cleaned every morning by a staff member. In the men’s area, there are 3 showers, 3 toilets, 2 sinks with mirrors and another sink without one. Everything is relatively clean.\n\nThere is a large outdoor courtyard with an open cabana where you can relax on comfortable leather sofas. The hostel also has an outdoor parking area where you can safely park your car. The environment feels secure.\n\nEvery week, many job offers are posted, and there is a strong sense of mutual help between the guests. Everyone is friendly and respectful. This place does not have a bad reputation at all — quite the opposite. Friends of mine stayed in other backpackers around Perth and they all told me this one deserves at least an 8.5/10. Some other hostels struggle with cleanliness and safety, but not this one.\n\nI highly recommend this backpacker hostel because you won’t find a better value for money. It’s the perfect place for a first experience in Australia. There are rooms of 4, 8, 12, and 16 beds with good people, and the place is both clean and peaceful. A great environment to start your Australian adventure the right way.",

I stayed for two weeks, and, as it was my first hostel experience, I was initially a bit apprehensive. However, those concerns quickly disappeared. The property was exceptionally clean, and the staff were incredibly welcoming. A special thank you to Eve, who checked me in, and made sure I had everything I needed.\n\nThe kitchen facilities were outstanding. There was a full, industrial-sized kitchen, with two large ovens, and plenty of food preparation space. The common areas, both indoors and outdoors, were also excellent—comfortable, spacious, and perfect for relaxing or socialising.\n\nThe overall atmosphere was friendly, and fellow guests were respectful and quiet. The only downside was the limited number of bathrooms—just two toilets, and three showers—which could be a little inconvenient in the mornings. That said, I understand renovations are currently underway, so I hope to see improvements in that area soon.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience. I would gladly stay here again.",

The room was shockingly dirty, it looked and smelled like it hadn’t been cleaned in years (in other hostels, rooms are cleaned every morning). I found old socks and belongings from previous guests next to my bed, and there was dust and dirt everywhere.\n\nI felt so uncomfortable that I only came back to sleep and avoided all common areas entirely. I didn’t even bother checking out the kitchen or lounge.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say is that the toilets were relatively clean.\n\nI tried to cancel and get my money back, but that wasn’t possible. If you care even a little about hygiene or comfort, I strongly recommend staying elsewhere.",

They’ve just put AC in all the rooms. However price doesn’t vary from 4 man room to a 10 man room, it’s the same price which doesn’t make much sense. Lots of toilets as well as shower room with lockable door instead of shared bathrooms. Would recommend, especially if you are French or Italian as there’s many here.",

The website told us our room had a bunk bed. We arrived to be greeted by two mouldy, dirty mattresses on top of each other which barely fitted me and my friend. Next, the bathrooms. If I said some of the words that come to mind when I think of the bathroom I would probably get banned. It smelt like hell on earth. Showers looked like they had been puked on. Don’t think they had been cleaned in a long time. You could smell the bathrooms from the end of one corridor. Absolutely disgusting!!!! Only positive was the location was very good. Would not stay again👍",

This humble rest area is not just a pit stop for weary travelers, but a haven of respite and tranquility that offers a glimpse into the rugged beauty of the region.\n\nAs you pull into the rest area, the vastness of the surrounding landscape immediately captivates you. The untamed wilderness stretches as far as the eye can see, with rolling hills, towering trees, and a sense of serenity that is both humbling and awe-inspiring. It's a place where time seems to slow down, allowing you to disconnect from the chaos of the world and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe amenities at John Tognela Rest Area are simple yet sufficient. Picnic tables invite you to sit down and enjoy a meal amidst the natural splendor, while clean restroom facilities provide a brief respite from the journey. But it's the surroundings that truly steal the show. The air is crisp and fragrant, carrying whispers of eucalyptus and wildflowers. The sounds of birds chirping and leaves rustling create a soothing symphony, as if nature itself is putting on a private performance just for you.\n\nTake a moment to explore the area on foot, and you'll discover hidden trails that lead you deeper into the wilderness. Wander through groves of ancient trees, their branches reaching towards the heavens as if trying to touch the sky. Breathe in the earthy scent of the forest floor, where wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues, creating a tapestry of color that is a feast for the eyes.\n\nBut it's not just the natural beauty that sets John Tognela Rest Area apart. It's the spirit of camaraderie and community that permeates the space. Fellow travelers exchange stories and tips, sharing a sense of adventure and a common appreciation for the road less traveled. Strangers become friends as they gather around a campfire, sharing laughter and tales of their journeys.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, painting the sky in hues of orange and gold, the rest area transforms into a magical place. The stars emerge one by one, twinkling in the vast expanse above, casting a soft glow on the landscape below. It's a reminder of the infinite possibilities that lie beyond the horizon, and the beauty that can be found in the simplest of moments.\n\nJohn Tognela Rest Area is not just a place to rest your weary bones; it's a place to rejuvenate your spirit. It's a reminder that the journey is just as important as the destination, and that sometimes the most memorable experiences are found in the spaces in between. So, if you find yourself traveling through Western Australia, make a point to visit John Tognela Rest Area. Let its natural beauty and peaceful ambiance wrap around you like a warm embrace, and let it remind you of the wonders that await on the open road.",

Everything about the experience was brilliant. The reception staff were so friendly and accommodating, they went above and beyond to find a suitable booking for me. My family were greeted by the happiest staff they said they have ever come across and were shown into a lovely relaxation area to enjoy drinks and nibbles before and after their treatments. The spa rooms were decadent with showers and baths and the massage beds were warm and comfortable. Their massages and facials were the best my family have ever had and each of their therapists were so professional and extremely knowledgeable. They said \"all the therapists have magic healing hands\" and they felt as if they had left as completely new women! They actually organised to visit Cove again once more before flying home to the UK. The whole process was 5 star quality and i would highly recommend anyone to visit Cove Spa, I certainly will be sending friends and family to Cove again.",

If you need to cancel due to illness or travel you can send a text to a cancelation mobile number and you are credited a catch up lesson, which you can book in an online account.

I just wish the showers next to the pool would have set temperatures so they didn't change as other people started/stopped adjacent showers. It's a bit dangerous.

I was comparing a few gyms, but after seeing the quality of the facilities here, I didn’t need to look any further.\n\nThe 24/7 gym located on the second floor is absolutely beautiful. The layout and use of space is excellent, the lighting and décor very stylish, and all equipment is in outstanding condition and kept very clean. There is also a reformer Pilates studio offering both self-guided sessions and instructor-led classes.\n\nThe Wellness facilities are a standout, with an infrared sauna, a dry sauna, and two Odin ice baths available for private 45 minute sessions. The toilets and change rooms are spotless and well maintained. On the ground floor, The Yard Fremantle offers functional training classes focused on endurance and strength building, which is a great bonus.\n\nThey also have a well-stocked range of merchandise, including clothing and supplements. After-hours Bluetooth access to different areas is incredibly easy and convenient.\n\nOverall, an exceptional gym with top-tier facilities and a welcoming, professional team. I highly recommend Life and Soul at The Mayfair for anyone wanting to kickstart their fitness journey 💪❤️",

Mr.G (the Owner) is SUPER friendly, informative and helpful, he is a wealth of knowledge and has made our experience and the environment fun and comfortable, it was super easy for us to download the process. Everything is supplied from the towels, body suit, undergarments, hydra-lite (pre work out), showers and lockers are available, a small area for your young children to hang out while you work out, and or a sitting area with a comfy sofa, a shower is also on site with change rooms. Studio is clean, light filled and airy. My Husband and i enjoyed our trial session today that we have decided to commit to it for the next few months, as a minimum! We Highly recommend this venue and the experience, Thanks G, we look forward to our next sesh!! 👊🏽",

There are plenty of shaded grassy areas with BBQs, picnic tables, and playgrounds, so it’s easy to spend an entire afternoon without needing to leave. The walking paths along the beach are great for a casual stroll or bike ride, and it’s also very dog-friendly — seeing happy dogs running along the sand adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThe facilities are excellent compared to many other beaches: you’ve got change rooms, showers, and a nearby café if you feel like grabbing a coffee or bite to eat. Parking is usually manageable, and the whole area feels safe and welcoming. Sunsets here are incredible too — the sky lights up over the water and it’s a perfect way to end the day.",

Since I have a small appetite, I declined some items, but the experience of sharing a meal with other travelers and having a pleasant conversation with the host was a fresh and enjoyable change.\n\nA highly valuable service on the final day was the luggage storage. I was able to leave my bags and collect them later at my convenience.\n\nSince B&Bs often feature shared toilet and shower facilities, it is crucial to be fully aware of who can use which facilities. Guests should not hesitate to confirm details if they are unsure.\n\nOverall, it was a good two-night, three-day experience.

You feel relaxed the moment you walk in 🧘🏻‍♀️\n\nI had an infrared sauna session with a friend and it was amazing — super cozy, private, and comfortable. The health benefits of infrared are a huge bonus, but honestly, the experience itself was enough to leave us feeling refreshed and reset 🧖🏻‍♀️\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. They even let me have a shower afterwards, and the facilities are fully stocked — shampoo, conditioner, towels, the works.\n\nHighly recommend checking out the new space if you haven’t already. It’s a little sanctuary in the middle of the day ✨",

You feel relaxed the moment you walk in 🧘🏻‍♀️\n\nI had an infrared sauna session with a friend and it was amazing — super cozy, private, and comfortable. The health benefits of infrared are a huge bonus, but honestly, the experience itself was enough to leave us feeling refreshed and reset 🧖🏻‍♀️\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. They even let me have a shower afterwards, and the facilities are fully stocked — shampoo, conditioner, towels, the works.\n\nHighly recommend checking out the new space if you haven’t already. It’s a little sanctuary in the middle of the day ✨",

It’s so so affordable for the experience and I will definitely be returning regularly! I only wish the customer service was slightly more attentive, in my three times visiting there always seems to be at least one small thing forgotten, the first visit we weren’t informed that a shower was available, we were asked if we had any questions so I asked one and before I could ask anymore the person left very quickly. In my following visits some small things that bothered me were:\n- not asking if we wanted towels\n- not offering the music speaker, and then after I asked not making sure the speaker is charged or that I am able to successfully pair my phone with it.\n\nOverall I have really enjoyed myself at this place, the staff are really lovely and I feel so grateful to have discovered this place! These are just some small things that would help push this already amazingly rejuvenating experience over the edge :)",

We struggled early on with my daughter and her confidence as well as getting upset most lessons when she hit the age where she swam without a parent. Pritti consistently showed patience with her, reassurance and now has my daughter's full confidence in the pool and my daughter absolutely loves her. My son now has Pritti as a teacher.

Long breaks also provide good water sports activities at certain times. It’s marked off from boats too so good for swimming. The sand is restocked each winter by the cross channel dredging that occurs south of the river. Excellent cafes, bars and restaurants nearby plus the famous infinity pool at the Seashells Hotel overlook this beach. Dog beach just to the north too.

Also available for residents to use are communal bathrooms and showers, and a large kitchen and dining area with appliances, cookware, and cutlery. There is swimming pool as well.\n\nWe stayed in a superior 4-bed chalet, which was quite new and beautifully furnished. The bedding was high quality, the sofa and TV comfortable, and the kitchen well-equipped with high quality modern appliances. The bathroom was spotless and of excellent standard. Definitely 5-star quality! We also appreciated having an undercover parking spot right at our chalet’s entrance.\n\nThe location is ideal — about 20 minutes drive from Mandurah, an hour from Perth, and around 2 hours from Margaret River. It’s also conveniently close to local amenities: a 2-minute walk to an IGA, Celebrations liquor store, Thai restaurant, and a medical centre, with Coles less than a kilometre away. The beautiful Dawesville foreshore is a leisurely 7 minutes walk.\n\nCheck-in was smooth and hassle-free, with friendly and welcoming staff. The overall vibe from both reception and residents was warm and inviting.\n\nWe’ll definitely be returning!",

We had a couple families in our group and a wide age range of kids in tow. Young ones had a ball investigating all the secret spots and the old ones had just enough signal to remain stationery but not enough to completely ignore the surroundings (lots of buffering time). I think that's a feature!\n\nOccasional mozzie clouds, an on-site shop of sorts, and entertainment on the first two nights we were there with (paid) BBQ and coffee van were such a great option when we CNBFed cooking. It was pretty cool, actually.\n\nSome glampers might not be thrilled with the borewater amenities and general mineralisation present in a lot of fixtures, but perhaps they could take themselves off to Bunnings for a bag of cement....\n\nGood, old fashion, Mandurian holiday spot down the estuary.

She slammed the door in our faces at reception and wouldn't even let us speak! When she approached us she came at us totally unreasonable. We couldn’t talk or even ask for an explanation without being abruptly cut off. They definitely have a cockroach infestation, and if you dont like showering with moths, please dont come here. The cleaning lady was super unfriendly, no manners whatsoever, not even a smile. It feels like the owner doesn’t care about all these bad reviews. Can’t even have the kids play around for a bit without a complaint. If they can't handle a few kids enjoying themselves during the day and having some innocent fun. They should just say no kids allowed!! Seriously, do not bring your kids here, the caretaker has made it pretty obvious that they are not welcomed, even sitting around the table and giggling is too much for them. The park is completely filled with creepy and unwelcoming residents. Save yourself the trouble and find a better place!",

The pizza oven was fantastic but if you plan to make pizzas remember it does require preheating a number of hours before you plan to use it. The fire pit is great to sit around and radiates heat on a cold night. Most accommodation does not have cooking facilities we stayed in the forest lodge which had rudimentary facilities but the communal kitchen is well appointed. None of the rooms are en-suite all showers and toilets are shared this being the primary reason for me not giving five stars.",

          "reviewText": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A Fantastic Stay – The Best Yet!\n\nI’ve stayed at the Foreshore Motel many times over the years, but my stay this week has been the absolute best. I booked a couple of nights for last weekend through Booking.com, and the moment I walked into reception I could immediately see the improvements. The reception area has been refreshed with new paint, is ultra clean, and I was greeted with a wonderfully warm welcome by the lovely lady at the desk.\n\nMy accommodation room has had a huge makeover as well — fresh paint, new carpet, a sparkling clean bathroom, and brand-new bedding. It looks completely different from before, when it felt a bit old and tired. My friends staying in the room next door were just as happy, even commenting that their room looked and smelt brand new.\n\nThe swimming pool area also looks refreshed, like it’s had its own makeover, which was great to see.\n\nThe location is one of the things I’ve always loved about this motel. It’s right in the centre of town, less than a minute’s walk to the foreshore and surrounded by restaurants, bars, and shops. It’s also incredibly convenient for public transport, with a bus stop right outside the motel that takes you directly to the train station. One morning we hopped on a train and headed into Perth for the day — super easy.\n\nOverall, this was my best stay at the motel yet. The upgrades are impressive, the service was warm and welcoming, and the location remains unbeatable. I’ll definitely be back!",

It's just walking distance to Mandurah Terrace, where there are lots of restaurants, parks and events.\n\nIt's good enough for a 1-2 nights stay where you can sleep in after wandering about.\n\nWhile it's a 3-star hotel/motel, I think this place can do with a little more upgrade to their furnitures like the bed, chairs and the fridge. We noticed the fridge leaking air which could cost more in electricity. The bed is not in the best condition so if you have sensitive back, this might not be for you.\n\nThe sink also in the bathroom, too small to do anything aside from wash hands maybe. Aside from that and water will be all over the floor. I hope they can get a bigger one as there's enough space. However the bathroom itself is clean and we appreciated that.\n\nThe curtain also didn't cover the whole window properly; if someone thinks about it they can definitely see most of inside the room. We had to use the ironing board to keep the curtain in place to ensure we're safe.\n\nOn the plus side, we liked how they gave free shampoos, conditioners, soap and coffee. There's also a jug of water in the fridge, a kettle, a small microwave, and a TV.",

My children have benefited not only from instruction in the pool, but have also undertaken dry land exercises and mindset coaching, increasing their confidence and resilience as a result.

I know what I’m getting every time.\n\nQuality: 10/10\nThe change in pressure from relaxation to deep tissue is not only consistent throughout the therapists but they do not change pressure throughout the massage. (Besides deep tissue of course)\nThey also give PROPER Thai massage. Wash the feet before and be prepared for the slight contortion stretching\n\nPricing: 9/10\nStill highly competitive prices but incredible value for money, it’s only a 9 because who wouldn’t love everything to be cheaper\n\nFacilities and amenities: 10/10\nComfy beds and waiting room. Soft towels, beds and face pillow. The best face pillows I’ve laid my head on\n\nProfessionally: 10/10\nThey are all really nice and sweet. They are quick to get you in and will try and fit you in if there’s wriggle room. You always get a snack and tea or water afterwards, highly recommend the tea.",

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by both the hygiene standards and how a situation was handled afterwards.\n\nUpon entering the room, I noticed the shower was not clean and lacked basic amenities like shampoo and conditioner. I also pointed out a used tampon in the shower to the staff — something that should never happen in a spa setting.\n\nTo my surprise, I later received a message implying that I had left the item behind and was menstruating during the float — which I was not. The tone of the message felt accusatory and inappropriate, especially considering I was the one who raised the hygiene concerns in the first place. It also referenced a $1500 fee, which felt unnecessarily intimidating given the circumstances.\n\nWhile I understand the importance of cleanliness and respecting policies, I believe this could have been handled with more professionalism and care. It left me feeling uncomfortable and judged, rather than relaxed and cared for — which is what a wellness experience should offer.\n\nI hope the business takes this feedback on board to improve both their hygiene standards and how sensitive issues are addressed with clients.",

All the holiday sites and main front page of the LLLC site did not prepare me for the kids pool to be closed and a tonne of signs to have taken over the indoor area. With no reduced entry fee - my daughter and I went in. (I have since noticed that in their - what’s on section - is where they notify customers the pools are out of action. How about making it a bit more visible on the front web page ?)  I was in shock the minute we walked into the pool area with only about 4 people swimming (3pm Tuesday). Firstly - we went into the family change room to put our bathers on- and yuck the dirty water sitting in there was so gross. But we changed and went out.  Secondly - the mould around the base of the kids pool - where we left our bags so we could go in the big pool was a big turn off. The pool did not seem to be heated to what I have read it should be ? So I stood in the pool at waist height for about 60-90 mins whilst my 7yo splashed about. Thirdly - We then hopped out - and thought yuck about the family change room so walked into female change area where the teen girls who were previously swimming were scrubbing the tiled floor with soap and using a towel to dry and clean up an area so they could change - I said / oh this is as gross as the other area - but worse as what a turn off that customers were having to clean up the filthy areas - change rooms where we expect to feel fresh and clean. So we went to the family change again - I too had spare towels and put them down on the ground where it was dry near the door, (I did not scrub the floor though ) we left our thongs on and continued to have Luke warm water showers - it was disgusting. I just couldn’t believe we’d paid to get in to use such sub par facilities. Please please please consider keeping these areas super clean - if only to make up for the sub par facilities available.",

There are also no pegs near the clotheslines so for towels it's okay but for baby outfits it was impossible to hang anything we washed or that was wet.\n\nAlso we hated that the sprinklers were on in the afternoon on the main lawn. It meant our kids couldn't play on the lawn in the afternoon as it was wet. Also as it was windy the sprinklers were blowing into our already impossible-to-dry laundry.\n\nThe pool was nice. The place felt super empty though despite there being no cabins left to book online. There are a lot of permanent caravans and cabins there so we kind  of felt like strangers in a tight knit community. All the people we met were lovely though.\n\nWould suit families with older kids as the room upstairs in the cabin has no door, so our 4 year old kept coming down and wanted to hang with us while we were watching tv.",

All the rooms open out into an open central area where the restaurant and pool are. What it means is that all the sounds echo throughout that central area and through the door of the hotel room. If you are looking for quiet, you will have to wait until the restaurant is done for the evening.

The lighting in the room is very poor and you need curtains open all the time to get some light.  Bathroom has no fan.  Rooms are very tired.  Ocean view is average.  Wasn't cheap at $280 a night.  Pool is in a weird location.  Staff are lacking knowledge and takes forever for rooms to be made up.  If you wanted any type of room service forget it.  The book they have is very mis leading.  Overal a very disappointing experience.  The shower head was broken as well.  We won't ever book again.  I' have family here and was born in Bunbury.

Loved the location as we were in amongst the trees. Close to but not on top of the toilets and camp kitchen. Showers where pretty great for camp showers and the water was always perfect temperature. We even used the camp kitchen for our larger meal making and lived that we could store our extra fruit in the shared fridge.\n\nThe dam is beautiful, only down fall is I forgot my reef shoes and the ground is very rocky. The whole family enjoyed swimming and Kayaking. Would've been nicer if there was an exclusion zone close to camp for launching boats and jet skis as we had a few come alwfuly close to us. We got to cycle through the forest all the way to the bridge and that was so much fun.\n\nGot a chance to grab a quick bite at the café and enjoyed the bacon egg roll and chips. Their little shop sells everything you could possibly forget to pack and more.\n\nGreat interaction with ground staff and café staff.\n\nWill note there is no signal for none Telstra users (love that my kids where tech free 😀)\n\nWill definitely be back",

          "reviewText": "Our Glamping weekend was perfect ⭐️\nthe glamping tent overlooking the lake with it’s own balcony and seating area around a campfire was spot on. The tent was lovely, clean and had all the amenities we needed. The staff were so kind and attentative as soon as they welcomed us at reception. There were only small negatives one being the rowdy noise levels from other campsite “residents” very late into the night which made it difficult to sleep which is no fault of the campsite (despite there being an after 10pm quiet time rule too). Also, the toilet block directly opposite is supposedly meant for glamping tent users only (with an access code) since there is only 2 toilets and 2 showers, it was a bit annoying having to share the block with other campsite users. There is little to do around the area so any more than a couple of days might feel too much for some people, but it was well needed rest and relaxation. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend/public holiday stay here at Lake Brockman and have already recommended it to friends and family. We think it was reasonably priced and good value.",

Quiet area hardly any noise about from the local wildlife. If ever in the area again would definitely stay again. An easy 45,min drive from Busselton airport. Bunbury lovely town for an extra long weekend.",

I'm giving it 4 stars only because it doesn't have wheelchair accessible toilets or showers. There is a newish shower and toilet block but unfortunately it doesn't have wheelchair access. It's a pity just one toilet and one shower cubicle wasn't made slightly larger to fit a chair. Maybe sometime in the future management could address that issue?

From the moment I arrived, the check‑in was smooth and the staff were warm, friendly, and genuinely welcoming. My en‑suite site is spotless, with a shower that has consistently hot water, an absolute blessing on a cold night. The toilets and bathrooms are also kept beautifully clean and well maintained, which makes a big difference when you’re travelling.\n\nThe park itself has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. There’s a well‑equipped camp kitchen, clean BBQs, laundry facilities, and plenty of space to move around without feeling crowded. The layout feels open yet still private enough to relax. It’s also great having the beach just a short stroll away and town only a few minutes’ drive, so you get the best of both worlds, convenience and peace.\n\nWhat really stands out here is the customer service. The staff go out of their way to make sure guests are happy and have what they need. Nothing feels like too much trouble. It’s the kind of place where you feel looked after, not just another booking on the system.\n\nSurrounded by fresh coastal air, close to the ocean, and with everything kept in top condition, this is the perfect stop for anyone travelling through Geraldton or looking to stay a few days. I highly recommend Belair Gardens Caravan Park and would gladly return on my next trip.\n\nFirst time sleeping in my car. Im so proud of my little setup 😁😊",

It’s the kind of place where you feel looked after, not just another booking on the system.\n\nSurrounded by fresh coastal air, close to the ocean, and with everything kept in top condition, this is the perfect stop for anyone travelling through Geraldton or looking to stay a few days. I highly recommend Belair Gardens Caravan Park and would gladly return on my next trip.\n\nFirst time sleeping in my car. Im so proud of my little setup 😁😊",

The campsite was sheltered from the 50k wind and our ensuite was very convenient. Check in staff were very helpful and extremely efficient. You can walk into the city centre in about 40 minutes. The free museum was a great place to visit. There are many cafes to enjoy a meal as well. The camp kitchen is basic but has BBQ plates microwave fridge and wash up area. There was a bit of noise from the port overnight but overall it’s a quiet park. I would like to come back with better weather.",

          "reviewText": "$249 a Night — and This Is the Welcome I Get\n\nI’ve just arrived at Sunset Beach Holiday Park today after hours on the road. My arthritis is flaring badly — both knees aching, every step slow and heavy. I limp my way from the car to reception. Anyone watching could see the effort it’s taking.\n\nI walk in and say, “Hi, I’ve got a booking.” I explain it might be under my name or my daughter’s. No hello back, no welcome! She checks, says it’s under my name, and immediately asks for my car registration. I tell her it should already be on file because you can’t book with booking.com without entering it. She just says she doesn’t have it. No offer to check. No attempt to make it easier for me. So I hobble back out to my car, get the number, and come back in.\n\nWhen I give it to her, she asks for my bank card and driver’s licence. This stops me. I’ve stayed in plenty of places and never been asked for a driver’s licence just to check in. I ask why. She says, “It’s our policy.” That’s it. So, still sore, I go back to my car a second time to get my wallet.\n\nBy the time I return, she’s walked away from the desk. I stand there waiting, my legs throbbing. When she comes back, I hand over my details and tell her, “By the way, I do Google Reviews, I’ve had nearly 16 million views on my account. Just letting her know.” I say it so she understands: customer service matters.\n\nTravellers in caravans, RVs, and vans often drive for hours before they stop. They want a warm welcome, a smile, and to feel glad they’ve arrived. That first interaction sets the tone for the whole stay. Today, mine was cold, unhelpful, and made harder than it needed to be. If I was her manager, I would deal with her manner directly and explain that customers can make or break a place like this. You have to greet guests warmly and treat them well, especially after they’ve been on the road for hours.\n\nAnd it’s a shame, because the place itself is lovely. My cabin is clean and stocked with the usual shampoo and body wash in the bathroom. There’s a microwave, air fryer, jug, toaster, and fridge,  everything you need except the food. The camp facilities are also good, with clean, well-kept kitchens, an easy-access dump point for caravans, and neat ablution blocks. The park is just steps from a beautiful beach, with picnic tables and grassed areas to enjoy the ocean view. It’s got everything you need to have a great stay, if the welcome matched the setting.\n\nThe unit walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbours doing their business clearly. Not the type of things you need or want to hear\n\nBut the first impression is already soured. I arrived sore and tired, hoping for a welcome. Instead, I was met with policies and indifference. Facilities can be wonderful, but if the greeting falls flat, the whole experience is tainted from the start.",

So, still sore, I go back to my car a second time to get my wallet.\n\nBy the time I return, she’s walked away from the desk. I stand there waiting, my legs throbbing. When she comes back, I hand over my details and tell her, “By the way, I do Google Reviews, I’ve had nearly 16 million views on my account. Just letting her know.” I say it so she understands: customer service matters.\n\nTravellers in caravans, RVs, and vans often drive for hours before they stop. They want a warm welcome, a smile, and to feel glad they’ve arrived. That first interaction sets the tone for the whole stay. Today, mine was cold, unhelpful, and made harder than it needed to be. If I was her manager, I would deal with her manner directly and explain that customers can make or break a place like this. You have to greet guests warmly and treat them well, especially after they’ve been on the road for hours.\n\nAnd it’s a shame, because the place itself is lovely. My cabin is clean and stocked with the usual shampoo and body wash in the bathroom. There’s a microwave, air fryer, jug, toaster, and fridge,  everything you need except the food. The camp facilities are also good, with clean, well-kept kitchens, an easy-access dump point for caravans, and neat ablution blocks. The park is just steps from a beautiful beach, with picnic tables and grassed areas to enjoy the ocean view. It’s got everything you need to have a great stay, if the welcome matched the setting.\n\nThe unit walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbours doing their business clearly. Not the type of things you need or want to hear\n\nBut the first impression is already soured. I arrived sore and tired, hoping for a welcome. Instead, I was met with policies and indifference. Facilities can be wonderful, but if the greeting falls flat, the whole experience is tainted from the start.",

We arrived a couple of minutes after 5 and true to her word she was in the office ready to book us in. We feel she went out of her way to assist us after driving down from Shark Bay. The toilets and showers might be a bit old but they were immaculately clean and well maintained. Loreen was able to book us into a drive through site so I didn't have to unhook from car. Grounds were very well kept and sunset viewing deck was very popular. We done guys. See you on our next trip north. Lyn and Kev (Site 1)",

I feel this should have been disclosed somewhere. Rusted showers, stained cupboards and carpets, dodgy back sliding doors that could easily be opened if someone tried. There were layers of dust on the pipes behind the stove - very visible and very accessible to be able to clean as it is a stand alone stove that can be moved. Oven was nasty. Walls and light switches had built up grime and food splashes. We were accused AND charged for taking a single pillow without being informed until I requested an explanation as they took $80 from my account (mind you, there’s a $100 cleaning deposit). Luckily we thought ahead and took before and after photos! After several days of emailing we were refunded and offered a discount for our next stay. Would not recommend due to uncleanliness, being charged without prior notice, not being provided an explanation until I kept requesting one. There was also no notice of when the remaining cost of the booking would be debited, just an estimate of “about a week before your stay” so you are expected to hold such a large amount in your card if you’ve booked online. For $500 p/night this hotel is way below standard. We were so disappointed.",

It is also very quiet. The staff are very friendly and nothing is a trouble to them. They have fuel and also have take away food at the shop There are beautiful green grass sites ,power and water available at prices that are very reasonable by today's standards. You can exit the rear of the park to drive to the beach especially if you're a keen on fishing.  There are no Jumping pillows, no swimming pool and not much for children to do but to my mind this place is perfect 👌.",

I was imagining a quiet coastal stop a few hours north of Perth, but what I found was a vibrant city buzzing with life, charm, and so much more than I anticipated.\n\nTucked along the turquoise edge of the Indian Ocean, Geraldton has that easygoing seaside feel, but with all the amenities and energy of a larger town. It caught me off guard how well it balances natural beauty, history, and modern comforts. I came here for a break, and found myself swept up in everything the city has to offer.\n\nThe beaches are stunning — perfect for a swim, windsurfing, or just relaxing with a coffee from one of the surprisingly good local cafés (seriously, the café scene here is thriving). One of the most moving stops for me was the HMAS Sydney II Memorial. It’s not just a beautiful monument, but a deep reminder of the history this region holds.\n\nAnd then there’s everything nearby: wildflower trails, the unreal Pink Lake which are just incredible. I kept discovering more and more to do — way more than I’d planned for.\n\nWhat struck me most, though, was the community vibe. Friendly locals, art popping up in unexpected places, good food, and a sense that this is a place people truly love. Geraldton feels like a hidden gem that’s somehow still under the radar, but buzzing with life and intention. It’s the kind of place that surprises you — and then stays with you.",

For this you have access to one long drop toilet (clean and tidy) as well as a dedicated shower room, but it should be noted that this requires you to bring your own portable shower (or a bucket of water). Speaking of which, there is no water and so you must be self sufficient in that regard. There are also some undercover gas BBQ's as well as some picnic tables (also under cover). The rules state you can stay a maximum of one night before moving on. It's a cracking little spot and a perfect place for an overnight stay.

I believe his name is ALISTAIR as listed on the supervisor board. He spoke to a female colleague in an absolute appalling, aggressive, condescending tone in front of young children and their families. It was completely unprofessional and unacceptable especially considering she did nothing to deserve this treatment.\n\nThe female staff member handled herself with remarkable professionalism and stayed very calm especially given the way she was being yelled at. I’ve seen her teach many times and genuinely believe she is one of your best swimming instructors.\n\nTo make matters worse I had been watching this staff member  ALISTAIR standing around just chatting. Clearly not supervising the children. A huge safety concern!!!!\n\nALISTAIR has NO accountability or integrity. I wanted to report him but I was so angry and upset by what I had just witnessed. He was completely at fault without a doubt.\n\nAs a paying customer it was extremely disappointing to see such disgusting behaviour being displayed. If this staff member continues to represent State Swim I will take it as a sign that this kind of behaviour is acceptable and I will be taking my children elsewhere.\n\nI  hope you address this matter urgently.

The office staff is amazing too, very helpful, super kind and lovely.\nEven now that the pool is closed due to the pandemic, they’ve been sending regular email updates with info on their re-opening time and what are they doing in the mean time, upgrading the pool etc.\nI can’t wait for my daughter to start swimming lessons again, and for my baby son to start soon too.

Don't be fooled thinking this is a cheap loveless chain gym as this is not the case.\n\nIt's super clean! They regularly clean and do a deep clean every Monday. If you're new to gyms don't take this for granted as some in the area are terrible. Showers are great too and plenty of change rooms if ya need them.\n\nHave been a member for nearly 2 years and the culture of the gym is great. No crazy people or turbo bros around. Seen a few of the local bartenders and other local business staff using the place which is a good sign of the vibe.The customer fridge in the kitchen is a welcome bonus and It's great having access to a balcony if I need to take a call. I also like how I can use Snap gyms in Melbourne (And everywhere) at no extra cost when away for work.\n\nAll the dumbbells are in great condition with about 6 benches and I've only ever seen one machine break which was fixed within days.\n\nSeriously super happy with this place and their great friendly staff that are always fast on their feet to help or fix an issue. Lastly watch out for the free burgers and tacos they hand out from time to time.. they'll ruin ya sets for the day ;)\n\nA++\n\n(Haven't done a class before but they seem popular with it's own private room away from the weights)",

In my opinion, it is a very complete gym that offers everything you need for a good workout, even though there is always room for improvement.\nThe lower level has spacious changing rooms, a sauna, and a large area with plenty of cardio equipment. Upstairs, you will find machines for both upper and lower body training, a spin room, a large studio for group classes, and another smaller room next to it that I believe is used for Pilates sessions.\nThe gym is generally not too crowded during the day, although it gets busy during peak hours such as early mornings and late afternoons. Many machines are available in pairs, which helps a lot when one is already in use.\nThe atmosphere is well balanced, with people who are genuinely motivated to train, creating a positive and energetic environment.",

Went in for a free 5 day trial as advertised on the website only to be told by a staff when I got there that it is only for friends of members and you can have the 5 day pass ONLY IF you are going to join. What is the point of trial then? The staff then proceeded to tell me about this deal they have going on now and wanted me to sign up immediately on my first visit without even a workout there. After asking a few more times and explaining that I would like to try first, he reluctantly gave me the 5 day pass. Started my pass on Monday, and on Wednesday once again he was asking me to join. On Thursday he gave me a call saying that I have to book an appointment to discuss membership options with him on Friday otherwise they have to charge me if I come in for a workout on Friday (despite it was still on a \"5 day trial\") as \"you have no intention to join\". The overly pushy and presumptuous attitude was definitely off-putting as they seem to want you to just buy hastily without consideration and I will not be joining Goodlife.\n\nOn the positive side, the lockers room is clean and spacious, there is a sauna too. The facilities are also new and with good varieties of equipments. However, it is quite crowded even during off-peak times like 2-3pm. Facilities wise I have no complaints, however the rude salesperson indicates that this place might not have the best training environment as staff is just as important as facilities when it comes to choosing a gym. I was told that I could not use the lockers as it's for members only by the staff however on my second visit the front receptionist who was nice and friendly gave me a temporary locker card to use without asking and just asked for a key or ID which was fair.\n\nBased on my negative experience, for anyone who is thinking of joining beware of their AGGRESSIVE SALES TACTICS! Before you sign up please look carefully at the fine print of the contract as this gym seems so sus! With my current gym they only asked me once after my trial ended. This is by far the most pushy gym I've been to so far. I understand gym salesperson would obviously try to sell their gym to the best they can as that's how they make a living from but expecting someone to make a huge financial commitment without trying, persistently asking even before the trial finishes, terminating your trial early because THEY JUDGE YOU as uninterested is LUDICROUS.",

Before you sign up please look carefully at the fine print of the contract as this gym seems so sus! With my current gym they only asked me once after my trial ended. This is by far the most pushy gym I've been to so far. I understand gym salesperson would obviously try to sell their gym to the best they can as that's how they make a living from but expecting someone to make a huge financial commitment without trying, persistently asking even before the trial finishes, terminating your trial early because THEY JUDGE YOU as uninterested is LUDICROUS.",

We ended up going down there ourselves and still had to wait in a 20 minute line for towels.\n\nWe were called by reception twice, and told that we couldn't use their TV as it was \"Too loud\" - one of the times was at 5pm, the volume was set to 30, the second time was at 8pm and the volume was only 20...\nI attempted to confront reception about this, as this is supposed to be a facility we can use, and I was approached by the rude reception manager who accused me of \"breaching my contract\" by using it. I asked her multiple times to show me where my contract had been breached, to which she couldn't do. The manager was never able to provide any proof or evidence to back her claim of us breaching contract. I had paid a lot of money to be able to use these facilities, and as I tried to explain that to her, instead of listening to me, she threatened to kick me out of the hotel, and walked away midst conversation.\n\nHer behaviour and attitude was absolutely disgusting. As a manager, she should be trying to make every guest feel welcome, and I was treated the complete opposite. Not an ounce of kindness was shown from her, and it seems other guests were treated as a priority over us.\n\nWaited 10 days after my visit and didn't receive my deposit back. I had to call the hotel myself, only to find they hadn't released the payment until my call.\n\nEverything about this hotel is atrocious. I would not recommend to anyone.",

Great location, ideal for what we needed. Our unit was on the 4th floor and they have a lift. Our unit was older and is going to be renovated (it has newish furnishings now). Underground secure parking was a bonus. The heated pool was being renovated so,  out of service during our stay, but we made use of the other pool. The whole place was so quiet, it was lovely. We had a balcony right on the front so the sunsets were awesome. Minutes walk to Coles and eateries. Loved seeing the Indian Ocean each morning and evening. The kitchen had all we needed and the washer/dryer were handy. We even had a second toilet in our unit. But I want to shout out to the lovely lady on reception, Helen. She was delightful. Such a lovely lady who helped us out and always had a smile and was friendly. We enjoyed our trip so much, we'll definitely be back and will recommend to friends and family.",

If you're bothered by noise avoid the pool-front ground floor. This place goes OFF on a Thursday and Friday evening. Absolutely heaving but great people and great tunes. Wash off the hangover with a dip in the sundrenched pool and cook yourself tender in the jacuzzi. The 70s fitout is immaculate, no idea how the rooms can be in such good nick with this retro fitout. Doors are paper thin so be fairly warned if you can't sleep through a party raging next door. Shouldn't have been a good mix for my business trip but I learnt into and it was!",

A lot of people come here just to bridge a short period until they find a house, but end up staying because there’s simply nothing better than living with your friendgroup.\nIt’s definitely the people that make this place so special, but even the hostel itself is great value for money and cozy. The beds have curtains for privacy, the bathrooms are cute and mostly clean, and the kitchen is spacious and well-equipped. Plus, we have two TVs for relaxed movie evenings! We also got pink girl's bathroom and the best shower partys in there as well as 2 disco balls (one at the reception and one in the kitchen) which is bringing the party vibes and a pet reptile at the reception. The AC is keeping it cool even on hot days and",

A lot of people come here just to bridge a short period until they find a house, but end up staying because there’s simply nothing better than living with your friendgroup.\nIt’s definitely the people that make this place so special, but even the hostel itself is great value for money and cozy. The beds have curtains for privacy, the bathrooms are cute and mostly clean, and the kitchen is spacious and well-equipped. Plus, we have two TVs for relaxed movie evenings! We also got pink girl's bathroom and the best shower partys in there as well as 2 disco balls (one at the reception and one in the kitchen) which is bringing the party vibes and a pet reptile at the reception. The AC is keeping it cool even on hot days and",

But day 3, and a normal amount of luggage, the floors had been cleaned, bath scrubbed and it was like any normal hostel. Maybe the mess was because it had been a big holiday weekend.\n\nThe kitchen is huge, and clean, which was nice. But 1) they could use having a system to label food. Japan, on the door to storage, they had installed a pen, slips of paper asking name, room #, checkout date; with roll of tape. Impressive! 2) Spiral wanted you to wash and dry your dishes but they were constantly running out of drying towels.\n\nI agree about the crinkly pillows. A nuisance every time you turn over.\n\nThe location cannot be beat. So near the bus and train stations, near a huge IGA supermarket, lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance.\n\nSo I'd say what you see all depends on the day. I saw no bugs. A few flies came in when the doors were open.",

Again. 🙃 As a busy mom, finding something that actually slots into the chaos of life is rare, but The Well nails it.\n\nThe on-demand Pilates has been a game-changer. I do the gym-series (a.k.a. Pilates with dumbbells) and wow — it’s brutal in the best way. Add in quick core sessions or stretch classes, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for feeling strong. Oh, and the step master? Let’s just say my glutes are still filing complaints.\n\nAnd the infrared sauna? Total love affair. I hook up Audible on Bluetooth, do some seated stretches, and while my body’s being slow-cooked to perfection, my brain is off living its best life in a world of personal growth. Multitasking at its finest.\n\nThe Finnish sauna is its own kind of magic — pure, deep heat followed by ice-cold showers. A different kind of cooked and frozen, and somehow exactly what you didn’t know you needed. You truly never regret coming over here.\n\nThe vibes? Warm, welcoming, and just the right mix of “wellness” and “real life.” Honestly, part of me wants to gatekeep forever… but fine, go ahead and join the cult of good vibes. Just don’t beat me to the sauna. 😏",

We were happy to be able to get daily workouts in in their Les Mills classes (Body Pump, Body Attack, Body Balance) and yoga.  The gym is relatively crowded with lots of cardio, stationary and free weight and machines.  You'll find people all over on the floor doing their workouts or working with a personal trainer.  The locker rooms are large but can get very steamy in hot weather.  The front desk staff is very friendly.  The only improvement I would suggest is class scheduling.  Most of the classes I attended started late, largely because they are scheduled pretty close to one another, making it difficult for one group to \"clear out\" before the next class starts.  There may have been other factors as well, not sure.  If they spaced out the classes a bit more or ensured they started and ended on time this would remove a petty annoyance from an otherwise very enjoyable gym experience.  We'll be back in January and plan to sign up again!",

Part of a 1980s complex around a pool but with most units having long-term tenants leaving junk around. One neighbour was clearly a champion burper, letting loose every now and then. The first impression after opening the door was from the musty smell. The rooms have not been renovated in their lifetime - a give-away is the lack of pictures available online. Even the kitchen draws contain 1980s utensils. The cupboards throughout the apartment were misaligned.The lounge suite needs a good clean. The TV image was terrible, suggesting the screen has been dropped or smashed somehow. The toilet trickle fed for more than 5 minutes to refill the cistern. After having a shower the floor mat had black mould on the underside. The spiral stairs to the loft bedroom are a death-trap. The car park was secure but the space very small. It does indeed have a beach view but most people would feel more at home if they put a tent up on the foreshore. We booked and paid for two nights but left after one preferring to lose our money than stay any longer.",

The apartments are located right on the water and are clean well laid out and modern, not tired at all like some apartments. The service was excellent and friendly. The amenities were clean and well serviced. I used the gym, spa and pool as well as the table tennis table. We had breakfast one morning in the cafe and the service, portion sizes and quality were excellent. Well done would stay again in a heartbeat.",

We had to move rooms a couple of times and Tenesia organised Nigel (maintenance gentleman) to help move our belongings.\nThe new rooms were ready for us to easily move into without having to wait and a big thank you to Nigel who kindly moved everything for us.\n\nThe rooms are clean and comfortable with fast wifi, gym, undercover, gated, free parking,  pool and sun beds, visitor washing machines and dryers.\nThe views of the river on your doorstep, with boats, jet skis, birds, ducks, people walking and much more whilst sitting or laying back on your own private balcony.\n\nSuch a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere that we highly recommend especially as we’ve stayed at quite a few places in the last 6 months.\n\nPier21 is definitely our Number 1 favourite.\n\nOur thanks to the 21.crew for their continued kindness and understanding during a challenging time.

The room was spacious, very tidy, a quiet location, it had great amenities in the room and the view was stunning, well worth paying $35 extra for the river view apartment. Breakfast in the lounge was delicious and the staff were super friendly. Only a couple of things I didn't like was the open top window in the bathroom which made it very cold, the fact you have to step into the bath for a shower and the dinner menu was not appealing at all. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back again.",
