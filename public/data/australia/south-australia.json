We were charged full price on entry, only to discover that the only area open to the public was the small kiddie pool.\n\nOne very disappointed 8-year-old… and honestly, the adults weren’t impressed either.\n\nIf full price is being charged, there really should be clear signage or public access times listed so families know what’s actually available before paying. We didn’t ask for a refund because we didn’t want to cause a scene, but we definitely left feeling let down.\n\nUnfortunately, we won’t be back — but we hope this feedback helps improve transparency for other families.",

It features both indoor and outdoor pools, along with three fantastic water slides and a very comprehensive splash park area.\n\nHowever, the \"software\" and amenities fall short of expectations. The café area is far too small, with seating for only four tables. Additionally, the hygiene standards in the restrooms and changing areas are quite disappointing. In the grassy areas, shaded pavilions and tree cover are very limited, making it difficult to find a spot to rest during hot weather.\n\nMost importantly, while the facility is new, the construction quality is surprisingly rough. For instance, the black metal strips on the outdoor concrete steps are actually coming loose; once detached, they leave sharp corners that pose a serious risk to barefoot visitors. The blue water slide has visible gaps and leaks severely. Furthermore, on a curve of the blue slide near the ground, the structure shakes vertically when anyone over 50kg slides through, suggesting a lack of necessary structural support. Lastly, the plastic on the green water slide is already showing signs of aging, indicating that the quality of this slide needs significant improvement.",

Just off waterloo corner road, very impressed with the new Salisbury Aquatic Centre facilities replacing the old Aquatic centre.  I believe there are 3 swimming pools. Two heated indoors and a larger outdoor swimming pool. Also a waterpark for the kids with the slides and tipping water bucket. Also a decent sized gym. Plenty of life savers patrolling the areas which gives a feeling of better security and safety. A number of outside shaded areas with tables also adds to the enjoyment. Also a large grassy area if you want to rest there.  Plenty of carparks too, except maybe on the hottest busiest holiday times. Also a cafeteria  and modern showers, changerooms and toilets too. We were allowed to bring our own portable chairs and tables and food in the  area next to the outside pool which was very helpful and appreciated.  Cost for the kids around $7.20 each. So rather inexpensive compared to some other establishments we have been to. Also a no alcohol policy. Was going to take some videos and photos but they also have a no taking images of other kids except your own which is fair enough. A big improvement from the old swimming centre and well worth checking out.",

It is a great local pool that runs movie nights with free popcorn and Summer fun events. A safe and beautiful place. Bbq upon request. Full size pool and toddler/ children's pool and green lawns. I really don't know why anyone would complain about this place. It's beautiful.",

The old-style change rooms are serviceable but could do with some updates in keeping with the period they were built. The main pool goes very deep at one end and is quite shallow at the other. However, the old filter system really pushes water through the vents which can sometimes interfere with any lap swimming, particularly breaststroke. As outdoor pools go, this one is generally very quiet, so don’t tell too many people about it!",

My daughter was very shy and she has been attending another centre for 2 years before we moved here, she is now confident and can put her face under water. Before she would scream and cry every single lesson. Special thanks to Cobin ( i think) he is the the son of the owner - my daughter went from hating swimming lessonn to loving it. Very different experiences compare with bigger pool when you feel you are just a number. Highly recommend",

My daughter was very shy and she has been attending another centre for 2 years before we moved here, she is now confident and can put her face under water. Before she would scream and cry every single lesson. Special thanks to Cobin ( i think) he is the the son of the owner - my daughter went from hating swimming lessonn to loving it. Very different experiences compare with bigger pool when you feel you are just a number. Highly recommend",

We found Paragon Swimming Centre at 97/99 Smart Rd, Modbury, to be a great facility in terms of the pool and general environment.\n\nHowever, there's a significant drawback that makes it unsuitable for families like mine. This centre does not accept the Companion Card because they are a non-government business. This policy means that both of my son's essential carers are required to pay an entry fee.\n\nThis creates a real financial barrier. If the support workers cannot afford the extra cost, or if it becomes too much of a burden for us to cover, my son misses out on an activity he dearly loves and benefits from.\n\nFrom a disability access and inclusion perspective, this is a major issue. While the physical facility is good, the lack of acceptance for the Companion Card makes it a difficult and potentially unaffordable option for those who rely on carers for support. Families needing to use a Companion Card may need to seek out other swimming centres that have a more inclusive policy. This has been a very disappointing aspect of our experience.",

First off, the park is set in such a beautiful location, surrounded by lush greenery and close to nature, which really adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nWe have been coming here for work on several occasions and each time we found the different cabins we stayed in were comfortable and clean. I appreciated the variety of options available, from cabins to camping spots, catering to different preferences and budgets. Our favourite are the King William cabins. All cabins are well-equipped with everything we needed for our stay.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the friendly staff. You can tell the managers set a great example for the staff to follow, all of them were welcoming and always ready to help with any questions we had. They were so easy going which made\n\nbooking and checking in so easy! You could tell they genuinely wanted to make our stay enjoyable.\n\nThe amenities were super clean and they have a small shop on site for basic supplies. We also enjoyed some lovely walks around the park after work and the peaceful atmosphere made it easy to relax.\n\nOverall, I had a great time at Levi Holiday Park. It’s a perfect spot for tradesman working in the area, families or anyone looking to unwind in nature. I’d definitely recommend to stay here if you are visiting the area.",

But the real nightmare was the state of cleanliness, or lack thereof.\nThe provided kitty litter was the cheapest black-and-gold stuff imaginable, and it looked like it hadn’t been changed or topped up in weeks – absolutely disgusting and unusable. My cats were horrified and basically held it in until we could get proper supplies.\nWorst of all, the cabin and surrounding park grounds were overrun with mice. My cats spent the entire stay in full hunting mode, chasing rodents around the cabin at all hours, under the beds, in the kitchen area, and even outside in the park. It was chaotic, stressful, and frankly revolting. This level of rodent presence points to serious sanitation issues – if mice are running rampant, what else is lurking?\nFor a place that charges extra for pets and claims to be welcoming to them, they clearly haven’t put any thought into maintaining a clean, pest-free environment. The location near the CBD is convenient, but that’s about the only positive. I won’t be returning, and I strongly advise anyone traveling with pets (or anyone who values hygiene) to look elsewhere. Absolute letdown.",

The bathroom was notably small making it difficult to use, and we found the door lock was non-functional due to a missing strike plate.\n\nThe bunk beds were not the greatest, with thin mattresses on what appeared to be homemade wooden frames. We experienced a-lot of discomfort, even after combining mattresses. Some of the linen was dirty and couldn’t be used.\n\nThe music festival during our stay created significant noise from teen concertgoers. The park seemed to be at full capacity, with tents pitched in unusual spots, like between cabins and in parking spaces, and some cabins appeared to be over-occupied.\n\nThe laundry facilities were also problematic, with many machines out of service. One machine left a brown residue on our clothes, requiring a second wash. We had to resort to using a laundromat 3 minutes away, due to the limited availability and a significant delay caused by unattended laundry by other guests.\n\nOverall, while we appreciate the park's location, we feel that some improvements in maintenance and guest services are required urgently.\n\nI would not recommend or stay again.",

The wind is very strong and was very consistent. I saw most of the tents sadly collapsed.\n\nI paid 30$ per night for an unpowered site, which is great for the location and what you get.\n\nThere are two downsides:\n1. There are a few long stay guests that have alcohol problems and I didn’t feel tooo safe around them. BUT nothing happened, it’s just me being cautious.\n2. The wifi is useless. If your looking to have good wifi for videos or social media, then this is not the park you want to stay at.\n\nOtherwise the staff was friendly and efficient.\n\nOverall very fair price and good spot.",

It’s extremely disappointing how there are so many reviews about the cleanliness being poor and the owners “being told” and yet nothing is changing. We booked into a two bedroom cabin and I am so glad we had our own bedding and cutlery because I would not have wanted to use any of what was provided.\n\nCleanliness of the cabin was extremely poor. There was mould on the roof of the shower, the walls and doors were peeling, dust and cobwebs on the curtains, food residue within the couch, the floor was sticky and filthy, cutlery was not clean at all and the smart tv couldn’t even access the internet onsite so the only available tv was standard channels. We had the groundsman come and look at the tv only for him to be told by reception that it doesn’t work with the internet. If you want to sit and relax and watch subscription tv, forget it. Unless you bring your own wifi, the internet onsite doesn’t allow for much and phone reception is extremely poor.\n\nOn the plus side there is a lovely cafe onsite that serves great coffee and banana bread and the staff are fantastic.\n\nThis is my second time staying and my families first and unfortunately will probably be our last  based on our recent stay. It is a real shame because the location is incredible.",

We loved how the boom gate recognises your car number plate, so we didn’t need to enter code when entering each time. We stayed in a 3 bedroom cabin overlooking the jetty. It was probably the cleanest cabin we’ve ever stayed in, spotless and extremely new and well made. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. Beds were comfortable and plenty of linen and towels. Bathrooms were generous sizes with a seperate toilet for main bathroom which was so helpful. The view from the balcony is stunning! It is a tight squeeze to get your car in the parking spot and able to open doors, that’s the only thing to be mindful of if you have a big car. The kids loved the jumping pillow and playground inside the park. The splash zone right next door was a huge hit. Despite not having a pool, the waterslides were a great alternative to the beach for the kids. We already can’t wait to book again for next year! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",

The cabin was modern, spotlessly clean and the beds and linen were clean and comfortable.   Our cabin had wheelchair ramp access, a concerted parking bay and a great patio with river views.  The bathroom was spotless and again had easy access for wheelchairs.   The cabin was spacious, well appointed and had a full size fridge with lots of storage.   There was an outdoor deck with seating and a private BBQ supplied.\n\nCheck in was easy, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The park itself was well organised, secure and quiet.

Great location, very friendly and helpful staff, good size space but everything very old and broken.\nHad to call maintenance 3 times during our stay. Tv didn’t work until our last day despite 2 x maintenance calls. Fridge broke and our food went off (did get reimbursed). Bathroom plug was stuck down so couldn’t use bathroom sink. Blinds didn’t go all way down. Giant cockroach in my bed!\nWe wanted to stay and use the park facilities but were very disappointed. Games room was 4 old arcade games that only one worked. Gym was a bench and 2 spin bikes and not inviting at all. Good basketball court and jumpy pillow. Washing machine in room but no where on site to get washing powder.\nI have 3 x kids under 8 and the pool wasn’t suitable for their swimming abilities. I’m 5’2 and the pool was up the my shoulders at the shallow end. The kids section is too small to use and drops off above my head.\nVery disappointed as a mum with her 3 kids who travelled 6 hours to stay here. Will not be staying again and will not recommend.",

The lack of supplied extras that every other self contained unit i've stayed in was also very annoying. No oil for the BBQ, no alfoil, not even salt and pepper. These are very cheap items that would've saved a few trips to the local Drakes. There was also only one of the smallest pieces of soap for four people for three days. Yes we could have gone to reception to get more but why not just have a few spare in the drawers for customer convenience? Bedrooms were nice and beds were comfortable. Bathroom was also very nice and the shower lovely.\n\nLastly we were super disappointed at the pool. My 9 year old who is not a strong swimmer had either the option of the tiny 20cm in height baby section or drown in the shallowest area which was 1.2M. I appreciate you can't change the depth of the pool but if i'd seen on your website the shallowest area is 1.2M we wouldnt have booked it. Oh, and if that pool was actually 28 degrees I would be very surprised.\n\nThe gym and the games room was laughable. We won't be back and i'm very disappointed with how much money we paid.",

Basic amenities but everything you would need.  Power, water, dump point, washing machine $2/ load, lounge and dining areas as well as a good sized kitchen. We booked in for 3 nights and stayed 16!",

However, the hostel itself needs serious improvement. When I checked in, I asked about lockers and was told the rooms don’t even have locks. That means anyone could technically walk in off the street and access your room. Because of this, I ended up carrying my laptop and passport with me whenever I went out, and left only my clothes behind on the bed.\n\nWhen I returned after being out for about eight hours, I was relieved to find nothing had been touched — but the door to my room was wide open and there was a strong smell of weed inside. On closer inspection, the door was actually off its hinges!\n\nThe air conditioning didn’t work at all, and with temperatures around 30°C, it was incredibly uncomfortable at night. The mattress was thin and uncomfortable, and the top bunk had no safety rail, which felt unsafe. The floorboards were so creaky that every step in the hallway woke me up.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean but basic. The showers were hot and powerful, but one of the bathroom lights didn’t work, meaning you had to use your phone torch at night.\n\nThe WiFi was strong and the location was convenient — about a 20–25 minute walk to the railway station, and buses stop right outside. However, the hidden entrance and sketchy vibe from some people walking by at night didn’t give the best first impression.\n\nI had originally booked three nights but ended up checking out after one, moving to another hostel. On a positive note, there was a BBQ on the balcony which was a great touch — everyone was social, friendly, and respectful. The kitchen, lounge, and common areas were good and encouraged socialising.\n\nOverall, it’s a friendly and sociable hostel with lovely staff, but the room conditions, lack of security, and poor maintenance really let it down. With a few repairs and better safety measures, it could be a great spot for backpackers.",

The weekend dog training sessions were also a highlight, providing valuable opportunities for pet owners to bond with their furry friends while learning new skills.\n\nOutside, the well-maintained fields for football, cricket, and tennis provided ample space for recreational sports, and I appreciated the addition of the remote control car racing ramp, which added a unique and exciting element to the park.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Mitchell Park Sports and Community Center was extremely positive, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and inclusive destination for sports, recreation, and community engagement.",

There is no swimming pool in this sports centre, so in this regard the Parks YMCA and ARC Compbelltown excel as they both have swimming pools.\n\nThere are a lot of outdoor parking spots so this is definitely a great place for doing indoor sports.",

I am a beauty therapist myself and have had many massages in my time, my therapist was unreal. Great pressure, good communication. Probably the best massage I've had in my life. Vichy shower was different to another I've had in the past. This one was in an egg shell type pod which made me feel a little claustrophobic. I laughed and said you better not be leaving me in here alone!?. My therapist reassured me saying no of course not and she was there giving me a scalp massage throughout the treatment. I could communicate with her when it became a bit too steamy and hot which was great. About half way through I didn't love the repetitive sprays of the vischy shower anymore, it became annoying for me and found it hard to relax. I'd love to chat with the owner about a few touches I loved and a recommendation to improve on. Overall an amazing experience and I will so be back if I ever visit Adelaide again!",

It did not disappoint.\n\nThe moment you step in, you can tell that attention to detail has been paid to this luxe venue for pampering and holistic healing.\n\nThe spa is well-designed and appointed. Located in the old Dunn & Bradstreet building, ceilings are high. Like top notch spa retreats overseas, there is the sense of space and air that immediately lowers your cortisol levels.\n\nCassidy, the spa manager is warm and unlike a lot of other spas, you can feel her genuine warmth and kindness. She connects to clients in an empathetic way which is not fake like in many high-end spas.\n\nI tried their seasonal offering: “Spring Ayurvedic Detox Ritual” together with an Indian Head Massage. (Details available on their web site).\n\nI think every spa treatment should start with an Indian head massage. It is an ideal way to start your relaxation journey.\n\nDr Shweta, their resident Ayurvedic practitioner is professional and knowledgable. If you have not tried Ayurvedic treatments before, you should. They are treatments that are filled with warmth and positive healing vibes. Dr Shweta’s energy is calm and nurturing and that energy flows through all her treatments.\n\nThe spa is as of writing (September 2025) still very new.\n\nParking is either available in the car park off Gilles Arcade or opposite at the rear of the Sofitel Hotel.\n\nI did provide feedback about the size of the change room and how top-end resort spas have their change facilities depending on the client’s treatments.\n\nI listened to Dr Shweta’s instructions post-treatment and am feeling detoxed and definitely more relaxed the day after. The herbal powder scrub massage has made my skin even smoother. It would have been nice to shower after the head massage and herbal powder scrub because it was not 100% comfortable lying there with the scrub grains. I am used to having a shower after scrubs.\n\nAfter my treatment, I got to relax in the lounge with some warm water, warm tea and light snacks. The protein balls are made by the owner and are delicious. The date stuffed with walnuts was perfect. I wish I had asked for an extra protein ball but I was in such bliss that I didn’t think about it.\n\nI definitely will be back to try a regular massage and facial.\n\nI am sure it will not be long before Selene takes top spot as Adelaide’s best spa. If you have been to the spa at Eon Skycity, this rivals them in terms of the level of luxe. The only thing that is missing is the steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and pool. However, Selene do have a cocoon pod and herbal steam bath.\n\nLooking forwards to my next visit!",

My family were greeted by the happiest staff they said they have ever come across and were shown into a lovely relaxation area to enjoy drinks and nibbles before and after their treatments. The spa rooms were decadent with showers and baths and the massage beds were warm and comfortable. Their massages and facials were the best my family have ever had and each of their therapists were so professional and extremely knowledgeable. They said \"all the therapists have magic healing hands\" and they felt as if they had left as completely new women! They actually organised to visit Cove again once more before flying home to the UK.

My money was wasted and I would have got a better recovery if I went down to the Chinese spot down the road for $50. If you don’t want a wasted disappointing massage then please avoid Claire.

From the moment you arrive, you'll be struck by the pristine white sand and crystal-clear water, which make for a truly picturesque setting. The beach itself is well-maintained and spacious, with plenty of room for sunbathing, swimming, and playing beach games. There are also several volleyball nets set up for those who want to get active. The water is relatively calm, making it ideal for swimming or wading in the shallows. One of the highlights of Glenelg North Beach is the Sunset Bar, which offers stunning views of the ocean and the surrounding coastline. The drinks and food are both excellent, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. It's the perfect place to unwind after a long day at the beach. Another great feature of Glenelg North Beach is the nearby jetty, which is a popular spot for fishing and sightseeing. You can take a leisurely stroll along the jetty and take in the views, or cast a line and try your luck at catching some fish. The only downside of Glenelg North Beach is that it can get quite busy, especially on weekends and holidays. However, even when it's crowded, the beach is still a beautiful and enjoyable place to spend time. Overall, I highly recommend Glenelg North Beach for anyone looking for a stunning and accessible beach experience. The views, amenities, and atmosphere are all top-notch, and it's a great place to relax and unwind.",

I tried builder gel for the first time and Jenny was very informative about the process and the benefit that it would do to help my natural nails. They look stunning and natural!",

We both got a 90 minutes deluxe package for our hair wash and also facial massage. We got everything from hair wash, head massage, facial massage, face mask, hot stone massage, half body massage.. to many to remember.\nThe staff was lovely and very well trained in what they do. The atmosphere was very relaxing and calm, price was very reasonable to what the services were offered. They also offer nails/ pedicure and lashes as well if you need it done\n\nWe highly recommend if you are visiting the city or a local to visit this place and you will not be disappointed. We will definitely be back here when we visit the city again. ( Blokes can also get their services here as well, amazing experience)",

Arriving, you pay by cash or transfer, and no health cover unfortunately but it didn’t matter as it was worth it. Reasonably priced anyway. Nuch got straight to work on me and I came in with genuine sores and aches from working at a desk all the time. Neck, shoulders, arms and lower back all stuck or stiff. Nuch found all my sore spots without prompt and really worked through them all. I wish I could have stayed all day under her care. She genuinely cared about healing me and she did this 11/10! Some masseuses don’t focus on an area long enough but I felt that Nuch treated each area as a remedial massage. Also I found the hole in the table and supporting towels actually fitted my face, unlike some places. Anyway, I was out of town so it was a treat to find a good place, as they are so hard to find",

Can’t even use the pool without being glared at by the men who use it. Can’t even go to try and use a locker without the woman in the bathrooms fully naked standing in the way of the lockers. Not a good look. They don’t even move out of the way for you. I’ve had a couple of bad experiences with some of the gym uses where nobody would be using a certain machine and I mean nobody using it, so I go to use the machine just to have someone go completely off at me saying they were using it when this person was on something else at that time. Swearing at me making my experience feel horrible.\n\nThe cleanliness of this gym especially changerooms is filthy. A lot of the times I use the gym when cleaners are there cleaning just to have a male cleaner in the woman’s change rooms, now how about a warning or even a sign like some other places warn you if a male is cleaning woman’s change rooms at the time. Cleaners do a slack job. So much grime and floor filthy still once they’ve even cleaned.\n\nI find some of the staff are quite unwelcoming. Especially some of the personal trainers. I’ve been to other gyms in the past and have always seen trainers or staff attending people who are using the gym and offer help if needed especially if you’re unsure of equipment.\nI’ve now decided to join a new gym, and have gone to this new gym and found everyone welcoming and staff way more helpful. First day at this new gym and already I’ve learnt how to use the equipment properly.\nThe people and general atmosphere is my welcoming. Even the gym users are super friendly.",

I’ve had a couple of bad experiences with some of the gym uses where nobody would be using a certain machine and I mean nobody using it, so I go to use the machine just to have someone go completely off at me saying they were using it when this person was on something else at that time. Swearing at me making my experience feel horrible.\n\nThe cleanliness of this gym especially changerooms is filthy. A lot of the times I use the gym when cleaners are there cleaning just to have a male cleaner in the woman’s change rooms, now how about a warning or even a sign like some other places warn you if a male is cleaning woman’s change rooms at the time. Cleaners do a slack job. So much grime and floor filthy still once they’ve even cleaned.\n\nI find some of the staff are quite unwelcoming. Especially some of the personal trainers. I’ve been to other gyms in the past and have always seen trainers or staff attending people who are using the gym and offer help if needed especially if you’re unsure of equipment.\nI’ve now decided to join a new gym, and have gone to this new gym and found everyone welcoming and staff way more helpful. First day at this new gym and already I’ve learnt how to use the equipment properly.\nThe people and general atmosphere is my welcoming. Even the gym users are super friendly.",

One of my goals was to participate in the much needed fundraiser, The MS Mighty Swim as a team participant across a 24hr endurance swimming event. Not having grown up in a swim club and taking up swimming later in my life I was able to swim 10 KM. Two trainers I would like to champion are Lachlan, my initial personal trainer, and Emma, my Body Pump group fitness instructor. Being a female in my late 50's I felt safe in both instructors hands who understood injuries yet still actively encouraged me to push my endurance further. Emma is such a role model in Pump workshops, encouraging me to push hard, though within my limits yet also to extend results. Emma guides with intelligence and restraint as to prevent injuries yet took time from her schedule to individually assist me after class to modify incorrect techniques. In the water I am still trying to catch that black line, but I am now stronger, quicker and my recovery is efficiently timely. A big shout out and huge appreciation to Emma and Lachlan.",

It’s been open for a couple years but still feels very new. The equipment is good, bit different than machines I’m used to but you adjust pretty quick. Decent variety of equipment too, couple machines missing that I’d like to see but beggars can’t be choosers. The crowd here is great though, very friendly and welcoming. The owners are friendly and you’re always greeted with a smile. There is a decent variety of classes on offer which will be sure to get you working and sweating. I’ve never been a big class workout person but enjoyed taking them for something different over the past 4 weeks. With the addition of clean, modern amenities, multiple infrared saunas and a steam sauna, you can’t go wrong. Selfishly, I don’t want more people to join at the risk it becomes overcrowded, but you can’t help but want these guys to succeed and see the gym pumping with people. Matter of when, not if in my opinion. Very glad I joined and intend on being a member there for a long time! Thanks Blackbird!",

On a mid-week night we, along with everyone else, booked a room at the sold out Lakes Resort Hotel as we were attending another sold out gig in town. Even under the pressure of a full house every interaction with staff was so pleasant (special mention to the wonderful staff member who was on duty at breakfast and accommodated our special request and made it a breeze for us, thank you!).\n\nThe beds were comfortable and the shower was divine at the end of a long day of travelling. Lovely balcony overlooking the lake with lots of local activity to take in. The afternoon sun hits the balcony wonderfully too.\n\nAcross the road from the local Westfield and an onsite restaurant - this ticked all the boxes and more. Our booking included breakfast which to our delight was not a standard hotel buffet fare but rather a selection made-to-order from their breakfast menu with bottomless coffee/tea/juice. It didn’t feel like a breakfast as I have come to expect when it’s included in a booking but rather it felt like we were out for breakfast at a local cafe with a great view and attentive staff.",

          "reviewText": "From the outside in, the hotel leans into its biggest strength: the view. The lake stretches out wide and open, and the rooms make the most of it. Big windows, a private balcony, and a slow, golden sunset that spills into the room like it belongs there.\n\nThe room itself was clean and spacious. The spa bath was generous, tucked behind a glass window that opened into the bedroom, a thoughtful design choice for couples. It gave the space a more luxurious feel, even if the finishes were starting to show their age.\n\nThe rooms are tidy but definitely ready for an update. There’s so much potential here, beautiful bones, but the styling and details feel like they’re stuck in another decade.\n\nJust outside our room, the hallway carpet was damp and carried a strong, musty smell. It seemed like a leak or water incident had occurred, and although we didn’t let it affect the stay, it really should’ve been addressed properly. A rug cleaner should have been running that day to extract the moisture from the carpet fibres. Leaving it damp creates not only an unpleasant smell, but a high risk of mould in the weeks to come.\n\nInside the room, it was hard to stay warm. Even with the heater on. The insulation was poor, and at night we could hear showers, toilets and baths running in neighbouring rooms. It wasn’t overly loud, but it was constant enough to disturb sleep. In moments like that, you realise how much silence matters in a hotel stay and it gave motel vibes as I had to step out to get some earplugs.\n\nOne major downside was heading down to use the pool and spa. No gowns are provided, and no pool towels are placed in the room, which meant I had to wrap myself in a bath towel and move through public areas, including a lift ride where I stood alone until a group of men stepped in. It was uncomfortable. For the safety and comfort of guests, gowns should be standard. At the very least, pool towels should be placed in room without needing to go to the desk.\n\nThe bathroom also felt dated in some ways. A single cake of soap was provided for the room, not ideal when sharing, and not particularly hygienic. A simple mounted soap pump and lotion, even a small dish of bath salts would have felt more appropriate and given the space a more luxurious feel.\n\nBreakfast was included in the stay at knots kitchen and honestly, it was a highlight. Fresh, colourful, and with plenty of variety, everything from poached eggs to fruit bowls, yoghurt, granola, oats and juices. Each plate was beautifully presented and tasted just as good as it looked. The only thing missing was good coffee. There was pod coffee in the room, but barista made coffee wasn’t included with breakfast. It’s a small thing, but it makes a difference. Good coffee should be part of the package, not an extra charge each morning.\n\nWe had dinner at Knots Kitchen, the in house restaurant. I ordered the fish tacos and was genuinely surprised. I almost skipped them, the menu listed lettuce, which didn’t exactly inspire confidence. But what arrived was flavourful and balanced: pickled vegetables, coriander, jalapeños, lime, cooked well and full of brightness. Easily one of the better fish tacos I’ve had in Adelaide. The menu really undersells them, and from a dietary perspective alone, ingredients like that should be listed. A photo on the app or updated description would not only help people know what they’re ordering, but also do the food justice.\n\nWe also visited Tunki Ceviche & Grill during our stay, a completely separate restaurant within the hotel and it’s well worth a visit. I’ve written a separate review highlighting it in more detail.\n\nAll up?\nThe view and food carried the stay. The rooms are clean but dated, the layout is thoughtful but in need of a refresh, and the service touches, towels, gowns, soap, could all use more intention. It’s not a bad stay, but with a little more attention to comfort, cleanliness, and detail, it could be something special.\n\nFor a girls’ weekend, it worked.\nFor a romantic stay, I don’t feel it would hit the right notes.. not yet.",

When I asked for a receipt, she said she didn’t know how to issue one and asked me to trust her.\nLater, I contacted Agoda, and they followed up with the property. Agoda confirmed that the hotel would only compensate AUD 30, not the agreed amount. They also asked me if I knew the name of the receptionist, but unfortunately I didn’t. She was the female staff member working at the front desk during my checkout that morning.\nI feel the property was not being honest about the agreed compensation and failed to provide even basic essential facilities.

I hope the management improves honesty, communication, and guest care to prevent similar experiences for future guests.",

I hope the management improves honesty, communication, and guest care to prevent similar experiences for future guests.",

New renovations are tastefully done but there are a few things lacking. Air conditioner is only cold air. There is an electric plug in heater which does work well but takes longer to heat up the room. We arrived for a late check in to a very cold room.  Would be good if they turned the heater on to heat up the room. The fridge/freezer was turned off and not cold! There was only one reading lamp for the double bed and no other good reading light for the 2nd person to read in bed. Please put towel rails for 2 towels in the bathroom so guests can choose to hang their towels to reuse  if staying longer than one night. Did not like the toilet tissue dispenser .... hard to pull toilet tissues out without tearing and not wanting to pull out. Why not have a usual toilet roll on a toilet roll holder?\nAlso need to provide a toaster. All other 3 star motels we've stayed in provide a toaster.",

Basic shower and toilets and also a covered bbq and table area.  Most sites have a 4x3 metre mat to keep a bit of the dirt and sand out of your rig.\nThe very shallow water in this area means that often it’s quite a long way from the dune to the water, many hundred’s of metres in fact, so if you are hoping for a swim it would pay to check the tide times and wind forecast. It’s also possible to catch blue swimmer crabs here if you have the skills and the energy and the patience.\nI particularly enjoyed the shore birds that visit, although the Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary is very close and a bit more suited to bird watching as it’s less populated.",

The place smells magical thanks to essential oils and all the rooms are just bliss. The change room makes you feel like you are in  pure lux and what to say about the massive crystals energizing the place everywhere you go. The relaxation room at the end of your treatment is the cherry on top with waterfront views, comfy lounge chairs, yummy tea and more crystals. I am so grateful to have come about this gem! Will be back. Thank you Anna & your husband for this business and Laura for my beautiful massage.",

Bacteria & Mould would love these towels. Unfortunately Nora wasn't able to find any dry ones, they were all in the same state so I got dressed & headed out to request a refund. Unfortunately the Manager Alyssia was no help. She could not offer a refund & after speaking with the owner said I needed to call Customer Service to arrange it. Very poor form  from Alyssia & the owner to put the entire responsibility of the refund back in the hands of a very disappointed client. All the manger could do was repeat 'Im sorry there's nothing I can do, you'll have to ring Customers Service' when the polite, helpful & understanding therapist Nora came into the room & promptly arranged a cash refund. It took her less than 2 minutes so I am left wondering why it wasn't done I the first place. I might have accepted it was an unfortunate first experience & rebooked for another time but after the frustration of Alyssia & the owner, I won't be going back. There are so many far more professional  places, without damp musty towels, where I can spend my money. So disappointing.",

She did ask me twice if she should be more gentle and I said “yes” but it was still the most rough facial that I have had. I have downgraded my review from 3⭐️ to 1⭐️ - you pay for what you get.\n\n==================================\n\nFirstly, this is not a luxury day spa. However, with the way cost of living is going, self care needs to fit a budget. The spa is clean and neat. I had a 60-min massage and a detox and deep clean facial. Whilst the beds are not as comfortable as luxury day spas and the towels are like those from a motel, my therapist Frantine was 5-stars.\n\nIt is on the rare occasion that one would come across a therapist who is equally good in massaging as well as the facial. Frantine has the highly sought after “magic hands”. The pressure for the massage was perfect as was her technique during the facial. Due to her skill and talent alone, it has bumped what would have been 2-stars to 3-stars.\n\nThe minus points were:\n1) No offer of water or tea on arrival\n2) I was told to go to the 2nd floor - the place has 2 mezzanines and it’s confusing\n3) uncomfortable beds\n4) the bolster placed under the knees is very thin\n5) scrappy old and thin towels that are not too small - they should use bath sheets\n6) no offer of water or tea at the end of the treatment\n7) the equipment was dragged from the room whilst I was dosing off during the mask-portion of my facial which woke me up.\n\nEven so, for Frantine’s skill, I would return for another massage and facial.",

          "reviewText": "Blue Lagoon North Adelaide Review\n\nMy daughter and I visited Blue Lagoon North Adelaide for a hair spa experience, and it was a delightful treat. The warm welcome and soothing tea in the waiting area set a lovely tone. The hair spa itself, complete with a neck massage, luxury shampoo, and conditioner, was a solid experience, well worth the $99 for 30 minutes. The blow-dry room was thoughtfully equipped with all necessary hair care products, and the second cup of invigorating tea was a nice touch. The staff's professionalism and the exit service were commendable, making us feel truly valued.\n\nTo elevate the experience further, a few tweaks could make a big difference. The ambient room was beautiful, but loud water piping occasionally disrupted the calm. Swapping the small towel over the eyes for a nourishing eye treatment on cotton pads would enhance comfort and add a luxurious touch. Additionally, relocating the blow-dry room away from the staff room could minimise interruptions and create a more private, relaxing space. From a sales perspective, showcasing the divine shampoo and conditioner for purchase would be a fantastic upsell opportunity. Lastly, clearer signage on level 2 near the restaurant would make finding the salon much easier, especially for newcomers.\n\nOverall, Blue Lagoon offers a wonderful experience with a few opportunities to polish an already great service. We'll definitely be back!",

          "reviewText": "My 30-minute float at Blue Lagoon Float and Spa Hyde Park was amazing—honestly, it saved me the airfare to the Dead Sea! The feeling of weightlessness was exactly how I imagine floating in space. The underwater speaker was a great touch, as my ears were submerged, and the sounds were calming. I did ask about more nature sounds beyond ocean waves, but options were limited—something to consider for future playlists! Having the water spray handy was an eye saver when you accidently get a bit of water in your eyes when getting the hang of it.\n\nEverything needed for the float was within reach, and the staff member’s explanation was clear and helpful. However, just as she was doing a great job setting the peaceful atmosphere, two other staff members giggling down the corridor briefly interrupted the serenity. Not a huge deal, but a little distracting in what’s meant to be an ultra-relaxing uber premium experience.\n\nThe 30-minute infrared sauna was also a highlight! The dry heat was great, and the controls were super easy to adjust. Being 6ft tall, I could sit comfortably but couldn’t lie down, which I usually like in larger traditional saunas. The biggest surprise? A damp towel—on a 37-degree day! The staff mentioned they were having trouble drying them, which seemed ironic given the weather. Not a deal breaker, but definitely a small fix that would improve the experience.\n\nOverall, it’s a great place to try floating, especially with their affordable entry level deals. A few small touches—more sound choices, a bit more staff awareness, and dry towels—and this would be an easy 5-star experience. I can absolutely see why, this is a 5-star spot for many people. I’ll definitely be back (maybe with my own towel, just in case)! 😆",

The water is crystal clear and looks about a foot deep when in fact it is 7meters!\nThere are LOTS of steps, so no wheelchair access, and you need to be relatively ambulant.\nThere is a gift shop, amenities and ample street parking.\nYou are requested to pre-purchase your tickets via a QR code on the board out the front!

The restaurant didn't have the biggest menu and was quite expensive. Example, $12 for a bottle of sparkling water and $50 for a dozen oysters. The rooms are on the smaller side with not much moving around room. The second double bed seems like a waste. The shower is also packed in a corner with the shower head opposite the door and above the tap handle, meaning you would open the door, reach in and turn on the shower and then get sprayed in the face, as water blasts out into the bathroom space. The water would also go from set temperature to boiling hot to freezing cold (must have been affected by others showering at the same time). The wifi kept dropping out which also affected the Foxtel on the tv (would have been a good option to the the ability for streaming services). Coming back to the room from a long day of work, it would have been nice to be able to have a decent shower, sit, watch tv and scroll. Also whilst there were mugs in the room, it would have been great to have some bowls. The laundry service advertised was a coin washing machine and dryer (having more then one machine and the ability to pay by card would have been a great option). It was ok, I just wouldn't recommend the commodore to anyone looking for a spacious, comfortable option on their travels, maybe a stay where you don't intend to spend too much time at the accommodation.",

The area at the front for people with their own vans was nice to arrive at but up the back where we were was far from that. Fortunately we found a beautiful property called 'Pet Friendly Cottages' (they had a cancellation for two nights) in Worrolong which was just perfect in every way, the whole property was so inviting, heater on for us on arrival, very cosy for us and our dog Monty. Goodies in the house that we enjoyed,  owners Russell and Pauline.. so so friendly you couldn't have asked for any more. Definately dog friendly and you couldn't compare to where we first booked and stayed. We found it via my sister in law who lives in Mt Gambier. Open space, country feel, small lockable yard for Monty the dog to be in and safe.The cabin (Limestone Coast) under this review WAS clean, bed comfy with electric blanket, but cold and uninviting. We booked 3 nights, stayed one and lost $400. Charged $200 a night but looking now on website it says $133.00 a night..not sure why extra cost, maybe because of the rodeo and sporting weekend there,   all dog friendly was booked out! We were up the back of the park in a cabin no. 5. We had a small dog. It wasn't pet friendly, it was pets welcome!!! There was no yard or area at all for a dog. We were up the back where it was quite unkept. What little lawn there was, was unmowed. It was 4 rooms in a square box, website deceiving, looked much nicer and bigger than ours was. A small porch, a lounge come bedroom/double bunk/couch/tv room, all in one. No cupboards or shelves in the bathroom to put essentials in or on, so all items on the floor. No wardrobe, a small unit on the wall with 2 coat hangers for our clothes, that was it had to live out of our cases that could only go on the bunks in the lounge/bedroom. Kitchen small but usable, all utensils and crockery old and well used. Shower awful, no water pressure in the shower or hot tap over the sink. Shower water ran hot and cold, hard to adjust then just went cold. There was no lighting outside our cabin so thank goodness we had a torch to take the dog for a walk before his bedtime. I saw a couple of reviews and wondered if it was the same part of the park we were in. We have no caravan to travel with, so rely on the website to be accurate. We've travelled a lot, over the years and mostly with a dog but never not stayed in the places we had booked on line.  Unfortunately this isn't a nice place to have stayed and i think their ratings for some or all the cabins up the back should be reviewed....",

Also extremely convenient how close all the amenities were to each other!\nBut, we were camping there in a tent at site 31, but there was a massive dry patch with no grass there! I get that caravans usually stay at powered sites, but please still try to maintain your grass!\nAnother issue is the camp kitchen. I understand how it’s a small Big4 Holiday Park, but the kitchen was tiny, with only 1 sink and oven! Also it was extremely crowded around meal times, so it was hard to prepare food and enjoy it in some sort of peace! I highly recommend fixing this issue, and as soon as possible!\nBut other than that everything was wonderful :)",

The caravan park is the best we have been to and the staff and the amenities were spot on. We had an ensuited caravan site which was modern and spotless and a very spacious site for our large van. They are continually adding and updating the park so the kids who stay can really enjoy the heated undercover pool, pickle ball court and the bike track. Plenty of walking tracks with Valley Lake and the incredible Blue Lake at your door step.This park is a must , highly recommend.",

After deciding another caravan park in the centre of town did not live up to our expectations, we drove up to Blue Lake and the friendly staff confirmed they had availability despite it not showing online. The park was lovely - we especially enjoyed the pool and waterslides!! Toilet and showers were clean, WiFi worked well and all amenities were easy to locate. Good value for money also, so would definitely recommend.",

Park is divided by a town road, where the part we stayed in had very large sites, but was very old and lots of perms. Dump point across the road. Personally, I didn’t feel safe - we had a self titled homeless girl ask for a towel to shower (which she was given), people screaming at each other on the other side of the fence, and sirens for most of the stay. Amenities clean and park is centrally located, but not one we would go back to.",

Our site was right on the waterfront.\n\nLarge swimming pool with lots of shade available, splash park, bike pump track, jumping pillow and playground. The splash park looks quite faded so could be due for an update.\nPlenty of stuff to hire on the lake too like stand up paddle boards, paddle boats and kayaks. Also water trampolines set up all the time.\n\nThe website says family facilities but I don’t believe a plastic baby bath on a bench is exactly a “family facility”. Definitely needs a parent room where the family can go in to make bathing a little one more convenient. Even a block with a couple larger stalls big enough for parents and child with a bath shower combo would be beneficial to families. We had our 5 month old and would have liked if this was available to us.\n\nCaravan park was a short walk to Main Street and another playground and cafe.\n\nEnjoyed our stay.",

Instead, we were given what appeared to be the overflow children’s annex from a double family room — three single beds crammed into a space that had clearly been retrofitted to pass as a separate room. It felt like a makeshift solution that children might tolerate, but discerning adults would find quite underwhelming.\n\nThe bathroom was a mixed bag. While the individually provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were a nice touch, the shower drainage was poorly designed — water pooled directly in front of the toilet rather than flowing to the drain. The sliding door wouldn’t close properly, and the exhaust fan above the shower was in a filthy, unacceptable state.\n\nOn the upside, the beds were reasonably comfortable. But the air conditioning and the curtains were significantly skewed, and while not critical, these details reflect a broader neglect in how the room is maintained and presented.\n\nTo my knowledge, there was no iron, no hairdryer, and the cleaning gear — broom, mop, etc. — was piled in the corner next to an uncomfortable wooden chair, adding to the general feeling of being in a utility closet rather than a guest room.\n\nThese are, of course, my personal impressions and others may feel differently. That said, I had no hesitation in giving 5-star reviews to both hotels we stayed at on either side of this visit — and both of those were older properties, likely dating from the 1980s, and at a lower price point. So I don’t believe I’m especially hard to please — just someone who expects a room to reflect what was promised",

They did offer some free ear plugs and coffee which was delicious. The shower is kind of small for a big guy like myself. And the shower head was super huge, with great pressure.

This was my first visit to Adelaide, and I had anticipated a more positive experience.\n\nA significant issue throughout my stay was the persistent noise disturbances. Despite multiple signs around the property requesting quiet after 10 PM, I was repeatedly subjected to loud arguments and screaming from a neighboring room, presumably occupied by a long-term resident and her children. These disturbances often extended well past midnight and continued into the early hours of subsequent mornings, severely impacting our ability to rest.\n\nFurthermore, the in-room amenities were unsatisfactory. The milk pods provided in the refrigerator were expired as of December 9, 2024, which I only discovered after consuming most of my coffee and finding curdled milk at the bottom of the cup. The bed and pillows were also notably uncomfortable, feeling exceptionally hard.\n\nOn a positive note, the motel's proximity to my friend's residence and the availability of free parking were convenient. However, these minor benefits do not outweigh the overall poor experience. For the price paid, my expectations for comfort and a peaceful environment were not met.\n\nGiven these concerns, I would not recommend the Pooraka Motor Inn and will seek alternative accommodation for any future visits to Adelaide.",

The pools, change rooms and other areas are sparkling clean and well appointed. At the time of day I visit, (around 3pm) I usually have a lane all to myself. After my laps, I like to relax in the therapeutic pool for a while, enjoying the soothing water jets and warm temperature. My membership includes use of the gym, which is also very well appointed. The membership entitles us to regular personal health and fitness assessments, with a tailored workout plan. Then, there are the many classes which cater for all exercise levels and tastes. While I mostly swim laps, it is great to know I have access to an entire range of exercise options - and all for a very reasonable membership fee. Staff are unfailingly friendly and polite, always greeting you with a smile. The coffee shop offers a selection of delicious sweet and savoury snacks, while the coffee can compete with the best in town. I can't recommend the centre highly enough and feel grateful that we have such a world class facility on our doorstep!",

Had reception call me at work (3) days prior to our arrival virtually demanding the remaining $58 to be paid in full straight away. I asked why I couldn't use the credit card they already had on my file to pay on my arrival like most respected hotels. Was told that it had to be paid up straight away. I advised them I was at work and it was a Sunday. I only had access to Google wallet on my mobile which was not enough for them. So they resorted to calling my wife who was away on business interstate to have her pay immediately. On arrival the receptionist was wanting us to move our car from the drop of pick up point outside the front door. I literally was still holding my bags I had just unloaded to take to our room. The room was OK. Large and a bit sparse. Rock hard beds. Advertised swimming pool had a broken heater, so was cold, obviously no one swimming around in it. Sign said would be a couple of weeks to get fixed. Other guests stated the pool had been broken for over a month. Had a great first night in the dinning area and bar. Food was OK. Spent about $300 and met some new friends. Went to sleep for a good night's rest and a well deserved lay in due to being away from home and off from work. Woken at 8.00 am to the sound of Jack hammering next to our room in the stair-well. Hotel was having some flooring Reno's. This very loud jack hammering with the terrible vibrations throughout the room ruined any chance of a peaceful romantic getaway. This went on non stop for 3 hours. Unable to even make a phone call as it felt like I was on the front line in Afghanistan during a conflict. Complained, respectfully to reception who said they would have the manager call me as they were in a meeting. Manager called a couple of hours later. Extremely dismissive of the situation, stating it was only a short disturbance (3 hours short, until we decided to get out of the hotel to save our hearing). Manager said she was sorry for our inconvenience. Absolutely no attempt to rectify the situation or make some form of peace offering. I explained that it would of been wise to perhaps not book the rooms out around the building works for obvious reasons. Manager stated that they would have had to shut the whole wing down and they were not prepared to do that. I explained that it may have been a little more professional to prepare the guests for that type of site works then the guests could decide if they would stay or not and even be prepared by bringing some ear defenders. Manager advised that they had some at reception. I figured the manager was over the call and just seemed to be belittling me and the situation. Very poor behaviours from the manager at what should be a great resort / hotel in a beautiful part of our State. I would recommend some further customer service trainingfor front line staff and the manager. Obviously we are not happy with our overall experience. Yes we had a SA state voucher to use, but we could have used it at any of the other available places to stay. Pretty sure the hotels get paid or some form of kick back for those type of vouchers. Felt like we were treated like people who were not worthy of staying at McCracken Country Resort.",

Very poor behaviours from the manager at what should be a great resort / hotel in a beautiful part of our State. I would recommend some further customer service trainingfor front line staff and the manager. Obviously we are not happy with our overall experience. Yes we had a SA state voucher to use, but we could have used it at any of the other available places to stay. Pretty sure the hotels get paid or some form of kick back for those type of vouchers. Felt like we were treated like people who were not worthy of staying at McCracken Country Resort.",

The room had excellent water pressure which for me is always a plus.The pool this day was not heated but being 35 degrees who cared ! The short walk to the Whalers Seaside Dining was well worth it with a great range and what we ordered was all solid eating.\nThe only downside is there is no room service at the apartments however if you're not expecting it then it's no problem. The concierge was pleasant and efficient.\nOverall the 2 night stay was a pleasant visit and good value overall.",

The location is amazing, you really feel like you’re deep in the bush however only an hour from Adelaide! When we arrived, we were unable to find anyone in reception (around 2pm) or get them on the after hours number so we just found our spot based on our online booking and set up for the night, we didn’t see the owners around after arriving so I assume this was okay! The grass was green and generally well kept. The renovated bathrooms were tidy and clean. Lots of wildlife and kangaroos around and one of the only holiday parks in the south that you are able to bring dogs AND have a fire. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.\nThe reception was closed and looked to be that way for some time, there were no supplies visible and the camp kitchen was a little run down, however we don’t rely on it so didn’t need to use it! This may be different in the warmer months! We went to the coffee van on Sunday morning for a coffee, however no one opened up following the open times on the board. Overall, enjoyed our night and will be back!",

When we arrived, we were unable to find anyone in reception (around 2pm) or get them on the after hours number so we just found our spot based on our online booking and set up for the night, we didn’t see the owners around after arriving so I assume this was okay! The grass was green and generally well kept. The renovated bathrooms were tidy and clean. Lots of wildlife and kangaroos around and one of the only holiday parks in the south that you are able to bring dogs AND have a fire. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.\nThe reception was closed and looked to be that way for some time, there were no supplies visible and the camp kitchen was a little run down, however we don’t rely on it so didn’t need to use it! This may be different in the warmer months! We went to the coffee van on Sunday morning for a coffee, however no one opened up following the open times on the board. Overall, enjoyed our night and will be back!",

Nice big oval for dogs and sports activities. We were there over the Easter weekend and there were activities organised for kids. The restrooms were recently upgraded with good hot water but there are only 4 cubicles for the ladies. Tennis courts and especially kitchen was in a poor state. The owners were friendly though. It was very central to visit the area. Somewhat noisy at night during quiet hours.",

The park is beautiful, very well maintained, excellent facilities, the amenities are very spacious, spotlessly clean with heaps of hot water. The camp kitchen is excellent and the staff are constantly getting around the park cleaning and maintaining the above. The grounds are beautiful and also being constantly looked after.

When the staff eventually did, they didn't say alot. The guests had to ask probing questions to get any communication out of the staff.\n\nIt should be understood by the staff that the guests are concerned for their belongings when these fire evacuation procedures happen that is why guests want the staff to be proactive in communication and not expect the guests to initiate communication about the situation.\n\nOne of the guests told me this was there second fire alarm evacuation during their stay.\n\nI may stay here again but a lot would have to improve, mainly soundproofing rooms or putting signs in the hallways telling guests not to yell and raise their voice in the hallways for the sake of other guests in their rooms and there would need to be an assurance of better fire safety training for their staff.\n\nDue to this experience I do not think the rate is worth it, because the experience was stressful for a two night stay.\n\nEarlier review: Superb food, friendly hotel and pub staff, clean rooms, great monsoon shower, worth  the hotel rate, and yes close to the harbour, galleries, cafes and shopping mall, and the historic Cockle train, if you are ever in the area or travelling around this area, it is worth a stay.",
