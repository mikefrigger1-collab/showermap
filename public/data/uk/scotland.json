Still find the custom that you have to take your shoes off outside pretty weird (instead of having the changing rooms set up so there is a 'dry' and a 'wet' side). There are cubicles for changing and showers both at the poolside as well as a few individual cubicles. You can punch your car reg plate in on a tablet at the desk so you get the 3 h free parking. The pool is halved to give 25 m long laps. There is a cafe and seating area upstairs. Didn't check out the gym. Die to all this being very acceptable I'm able to give 2 stars, but the experience of customer service I had was not great at all. I booked in for the advanced adult swimming lessons. Firstly, entirely unclear on the website that you pay a monthly fee that just rolls over if you don't cancel it. That's fine, I phones in about it beforehand and that was explained. However, while my breaststroke was deemed better than beginners by the coach on the day, I wanted to learn front crawl. After the 50 min were up we hadn't made much progress with this and I felt my couch was a bit out of ideas as he suggested I should join a beginners class for this, which I was willing to do. However, what was not explained to me was that a) as he deemed the level of class not appropriate for me, I could not return to the class and b) there wouldn't be a refund (I was pointed towards the TS&C's) but c) there were also no places left in the beginners class that I would be able to attend (the only one not during working hours). So I was basically supposed to accept to not get anything for my money this month. After a lot of emailing back and forth it was agreed that I could get 2 free entries to the normal public swimming instead. But this was not offered voluntarily, I had to literally bargain for it. As a side note due to a 'event' and the Xmas closure I would have not been able to attend even the adult lessons every week. Apparently also something that I should have just accepted, and that would have been calculated in would my next direct debit come round in January. And what if I had decided to only do this for one month???\nOverall while I accept it is my duty to read the small print I find that a rather uncaring approach to customer care and service and while I will take the 2 opportunities to swim (for more money than I would have to pay for single entries), I will after that not return.",

The pool tiles have a brown stain on them from where the water sits and all the vents are grotty or broken. Private classes use the pool which are not timetabled (some are and I avoid those) so it is hard to schedule length swimming for myself. In the ladies changing room the showers drainage smells and there are little flies in the cubicals plus some of the doors don’t lock. The online booking system is frustrating because it doesn’t open class availability when it should and the system doesn’t log when you attend a class.\nI spoke to the manager about timetabling the private sessions so people can choose a good time for length swimming, but he lacks understanding and customer service skills. No apology and an unwillingness to change.\nI won’t be back!",

I went at 9am on Sunday morning and was surprised at how busy it was. The group of older gents in the early morning queue were super friendly and jolly and I had a nice laugh with one of them about the lockers and someone stealing his shoes (kids, joking). The pool itself is clean and bright and the space is lovely. On poolside changing which is a nod to the victorian baths. Poolside was really clean. Five lanes catering for different speeds. Let me use my finger paddles which was cool. Showers fine on poolside. The other swimmers were lovely, the lifeguard waved goodbye to me when I left. I’ve rarely been in a nicer friendlier environment.\nThe ONLY downside was the steps to get into the pool were really odd and wouldn’t fit someone with not great mobility to get in and out. There was a brilliant cafe near by for my post swim breakfast. I’ll definitely be back when I next visit Edinburgh. Wonderful.",

I arrived Sunday morning at 9.20ish for the lane swim. Very helpful staff. The changing cubicles are poolside with lockers that are free to use and which you set a lock code for. Nice pool and it was as busy as I would want it without being jammed at 3 per lane. I chose medium speed and slotted in fine. I did the mile, showered down and left to be somewhere for 10.30am otherwise I would have checked out the sauna. Good old-school pool, decent facilities, clean, everyone in there seemed reasonable. Everything you could want from a pool and lane swim. Shame I wasn't in Edinburgh for longer or would have been back.",

Mostly adults paying membership despite that the bulk of hours is ‘family fun ‘ or ‘casual swimming with lanes’ (i.e. kids). Nothing against having sessions for kids but come on us grown up pay the lions share and get a raw deal",

Only available pricing option is 65 and 77.\n\nEquipments are very limited and the wifi sucks.\n\nPure gym and gym group are have such a big space and have most of the equipment and the price is just 1/3 of this gym. This gym space is such congested and very small and not even 1/2 of pure gym or gym group.\n\nI have seen Nuffield also expensive but atleast the space and hygiene is maintained well there for the price they charge.\n\nSuch a high price for poorly maintained place and facility. I highly recommend people not to waste their time in even checking out this place. This business should never be tolerated.",

          "reviewText": "Edinburgh Village Gym – Terrible Experience\n\nThis gym has been an absolute nightmare. First of all, the hygiene and maintenance standards are beyond unacceptable. The sauna and the pool are filthy. I have lost count of how many times I raised these issues with the staff.\n\nThere are six showers in the men’s changing room. Between March 2025 and July 2025 (a full four months), I repeatedly informed the staff that only two of these showers were usable. One shower had no door at all, meaning zero privacy. Another had a door, but the lock was broken, making it unusable because people constantly walked in. One shower had no water running whatsoever, and another had only cold water with no hot water at all. Out of six showers, only two were actually functional with intact doors. I clearly remember having to wait around 25 minutes just to take a shower because of a long queue in front of those two doors.\n\nDue to these ongoing issues, I decided to terminate my contract. On the day I signed up, I had clearly explained that I am a PhD student at a Faculty of Law, that I frequently attend international conferences and have intense academic periods, and that I would only sign up if there was no commitment, no notice period, and flexible freeze or termination options.\n\nI was explicitly told by the staff that the student deal was exactly what I was looking for: more affordable, with no notice required for freeze or termination. Based on this assurance, I chose Edinburgh Village Gym over PureGym, even though it is closer to my home.\n\nDespite this, after terminating my contract four weeks ago, I have been harassed daily with threatening and intimidating emails, claiming that there is a three-month notice period and that I must continue paying for at least three more months.\n\nAs if the stress of a PhD is not enough, I am now being forced to deal with this absurd and exhausting situation. I have already informed the University of Edinburgh School of Law Legal Services and Wellbeing Services, and we will escalate this matter to the relevant authorities as soon as possible.\n\nMy final word is this: do not make the mistake of signing up to this gym. Stay away.",

Quite a busy facility though with some comfy seats to chat (too low to work on and limited access to outlets). Tried the swimming pool - 20m with a couple lanes. Warm bit you can't use any equipment (locked, and only for classes). There's a steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi. A bit tight when lots of people in it and the jets push you about so not the most comfortable when in close proximity to others ;-) Plenty of showers including enclosed ones bit only two in the corner for changing. Lots of lockers and nice fob system making it easy to use. They can give you towels at a cost and don't recommend you buy the towel service as that's pricey. Generally a nice facility but never got to use the gym or classes. Look modern with new equipment. My only complaints is the monthly cost - at around £78/mo not really value for money considering you can get all of that or similar, maybe minus the pool for less at other places. Second, there was a bad smell like strong b.o. that pervaded the pool area and a different but still off-putting stench in the steam room. So I won't be signing up anytime soon despite the promo offer of no fees until Jan! There are a couple options of peak and off peak usage, the latter slightly cheaper. Hopefully this saves you some time but worth checkout for yourself! Food I didn't get a chance to try but looks like they have various meals including a festive menu and have a space to hold events located past the toilets.",

I am very fond of the staff, who are always smiley and keen to help and the fact that so many of them have been here for so long is likely a testament to the working environment there.\nYes, sometimes things break and it's annoying but the same thing has happened in every office I have ever run. In Facilities Management you are often at the mercy of external contractors and I have no doubt the staff get as frustrated as members do when repairs are not dealt with promptly.\nAs for the cleaning: the female changing room is cleaned to a good standard and the only complaint I have is about the members who leave their mess behind with no consideration for other users. While I miss the convenience of having towels provided, I do not miss having the dirty ones strewn about the place because dropping theirs in the laundry bin on their way out was just too much work for some.\nOtherwise, the pool is kept clean and the lighting and warmth gives that space a lovely Mediterranean feel.  I know a lot of people were upset when the jacuzzi was converted to a sauna and steam room but the cost to heat the jacuzzi became exorbitant (thank you, Mr Putin) and having these spaces manned full-time by the lifeguard means that they can always be open for use, which was not always possible in their previous locations.\nThe gym floor is well equipped and the double-floor height of that space is hugely beneficial because the heat rises and you don't cook while you work out. It also prevents the build up of work-out odours, keeping the place smelling clean.\nThe PT team are dedicated, supportive and fun and possess such a range of specialisms between them that you would be hard-pressed not to find one who can support your specific fitness goals.\nDo I wish the prices hadn't gone up so much over the years? Of course I do but I can say that about many elements of my life because everything costs a lot more these days: it is the consequence of living in a badly managed country.\nMy health and fitness will always be at the top end of my priorities list and - between the facilities, the staff and the sense of community I feel at Nuffield Omni - I am content that I get what I pay for.",

Plus, their website was the most straightforward and easiest to work with. So decided to go with them.\n\nI can only speak for the Conditioning class. I didn’t sign up for the other classes or the open gym.\n\nIt’s similar to a CrossFit class. Pretty intense if you’ve never done one. Obviously based on the name, there is more focus on conditioning than strength so don’t expect too much dumbbell/barbell usage in this particular class. Both classes I attended I was gassed by the end. If you are lucky to be doing group work, your team really pushes you and I loved that, especially since I didn’t know any of them.\n\nCan’t say enough about the people. Everyone from the trainers to the regulars were really nice and welcoming. I’ve only ever encountered this at my current gym back home. Major shout out to Lyndsay (so sorry if I misspelled the name), who was super sweet and welcoming!\n\nA few things I’ll point out:\n\nFirstly, CaveFit is located inside of Cheval The Edinburgh Grand hotel. When you go through the front doors, take a left and you’ll see the CaveFit sign. Head down the stairs and you’ll eventually find your way to the gym.\n\nSecondly, there isn’t a front desk or staff just hanging around to greet guests (from what I could see). If you go to a class, they will check you in during class. Not sure how it works if you sign up for Open Gym.\n\nThirdly, the locker rooms are locked and it seems only members have the combination to the key pad lock. I simply brought a back pack and set it in a corner in the class. Would highly recommend if you’re not a member and decide to come, you should dress beforehand and perhaps not plan on showering afterwards (although you could always ask someone to open the locker room door for you).",

The pool is often very quiet, with only one or two other people in it - I've had it to myself occasionally! There is a steam room, sauna, and hot pool by the pool, as well as a fully kitted out gym upstairs. The staff are friendly, as are the other members.\n\nOne of the unique features of this place is that when you join, you get a small locker where you can keep your swimwear. Tag your swimwear with your locker number and you can actually chuck it into the laundry baskets with the towels and the staff will wash and dry it for you overnight, and leave it back in your locker. This means that I can go straight from work, for example, to the club without having to go home to pick up my swimwear. Very convenient!",

The floors in the changing rooms were sadly, stained and quite dirty however my experience was positive overall.",

You have to bring a towel to sit on and flip flops, as well as a swimsuit.\n\nIt’s definitely rustic, but that makes it all the more charming!\n\nYou can book in advance, which is recommend doing as the sessions were pretty full.\n\nOverall 10/10 experience!

I travel internationally often and it's hard to find a good gym with the following 2 features that PureGym does have:\n\n-A 30-day no-contract membership with the price clearly displayed on the website!! (bonus points for being able to sign myself up online and getting a simple QR code to access the gym)\n\n-Power racks, free weights, machines, cables, and cardio equipment! I LOVE that there are plenty of bars, racks, and deadlifts platforms to accommodate like 15 (?) people at the same time.\n\nOther nice features are the app that shows how many people are currently there. It has only been busy like 1-2 times in the past 2 weeks and otherwise has been pretty chill. I like the variety of cardio equipment and the 4 stair climber machines. The entire place is pretty big. The locker rooms and bathrooms are nice and clean. I think the only complaint at all that I can think of is that there's not a cleaning station with paper towels and cleaning solution near the cardio equipment, so you have to walk all the way to one side or another side of the gym. I asked one employee on my first day where those were located and he was very kind describing where they were, so I appreciate the customer service. Price isn't too bad for 30 days either. Oh, I guess one other small complaint would be that there aren't nice cycling bikes elsewhere in the gym. Those nice ones are only in the room for cycling classes, so the remaining bikes in the gym are the Concept 2 bikes with no gears or the ones with the big seats for old folks. It's a small thing but just something I noticed.",

Despite the good internal facilities provided—such as gym equipment, washing, and changing facilities—the excess heat during training sessions, which typically last over an hour, has been a recurring problem. The gym is spacious, with a large downstairs area that includes a closed-off studio, as well as an upper floor. However, the large windows allow the sun's heat to accumulate, especially on the cardio equipment placed in front of them, and the lack of fans or AC units exacerbates the discomfort. To improve the situation, I believe they should consider adding fans throughout the facility to enhance air circulation, as the current AC units seem ineffective. This adjustment is necessary for a more comfortable workout environment.",

There is a driver's room where is free coffe,tea,sandwiches,biscuits,milk and cereal and everything you need for free and also a TV with a table and 4 chairs.\nThe bathroom is very clean with very clean showers that have very hot water for unlimited time.\nI stayed for 3 days here and it was amazing, 100% would recommend and hopefully come again.\nThanks jhon ( i think ) for everything :)",

From the parking to the Portobello Beach( very beautiful beach) you make only 5 minutes on foot.\nIf you want to go to the old town ( which it's just incredible and you can visit the scootlanlds national art museum for free) the bus station in only 800 metres away and the bus 26 will take you directly to the old town.\nThe personnel is super super kind and are there always to help you. There is a driver's room where is free coffe,tea,sandwiches,biscuits,milk and cereal and everything you need for free and also a TV with a table and 4 chairs.\nThe bathroom is very clean with very clean showers that have very hot water for unlimited time.\nI stayed for 3 days here and it was amazing, 100% would recommend and hopefully come again.\nThanks jhon ( i think ) for everything :)",

Co owner even gave me a lift to the retail park and back and refused the money I would have given the taxi company. Down side is it’s dusty but I know they have the plans to do the parking area in the near future.

The staff are very welcoming, there is a lovely big changing room with towels inside lockers ready for you, going into the building you get a sense of how clean the place is. The “wet area” consists of a nice dry sauna, communal showers, a fantastic steam room and a nice big round jacuzzi. Very relaxing! Upstairs is the dark area and cafe with more toilets, complimentary tea and coffee and water is available in the cafe area and the dark room has some fantastic features. Highly recommend!!!",

We booked a family room which was supposed to include things such as a microwave, fridge and a seating area, standard items for a family room. When we entered, there was no microwave or fridge and the \"seating area\" was a single chair (which in itself was quite dirty with stains on it) next to a coffee table. The beds were super uncomfortable to the point that some of us were just sleeping on a box of springs, meaning every slight movement set off a couple of the springs.\nThe room itself was dirty and looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly in a long time with marks all over the walls and dust caking the floors under the beds. A backpackers would be a lot cleaner and offer more, including hot showers which the one in our room didn't work properly at all. It was either hot or cold with no in between. Not to mention that I found mould near the ceiling next to the bathroom.\nI also noticed in the bathroom that the toilet seat was so much smaller than the toilet itself, meaning we were practically sitting on the bowl every time we used it. Not to mention that the sink itself had a big crack in it.\nWe tried to contact the owner but received an automated response, not to mention that the only time we saw a staff member was as we were checking out. We helped out a few other people with checking in and finding their way around as there was no one there 99% of the time.\nFor a place thats a 3-star hotel, it doesn't feel like it deserves that. If you're looking in the area, I recommend looking elsewhere.",

Such a great idea to reduce waste and help budget travellers.\nTheir free spaces were fantastic - lots of seating, quiet and loud areas, and lots of info about events going on.\nThough my partner and I didn’t take partake in any of the events they seemed well organized and very fun! The movie theatre room was a great perk for a quiet and relaxing nightly getaway.\nThe themed bedrooms were fun, big and came with lockers (locks provided). The free separate luggage storage was a life saver for all our big baggage as well. Washrooms were tidy and ample showers for everyone.\nFinally, the staff were amazing! Always friendly and provided local recommendations. They were great with communication prior to our trip, and when we asked to extend our stay last minute, they were able to accommodate us, working diligently to move things around 😊\n*Bonus points for the sparkly toilet 😍",

The showers were also consistently cold and the floors were always wet in the bathrooms which could easily be fixed with more frequent cleaning.

The shower and bathroom were good, with plenty of individual bathrooms. The bed was a type of pod with enough room to sleep, hang up my shirts and sweatshirt, blanket, pillow, and convenient shelf for my belongings and to write my postcards. USB and charging port. There is a regular light and also a cool color changing light for fun! There is a sliding gate or curtain that gives you privacy, however I woke up in a pool of sweat on a cool day, so I felt I needed to keep it open a smidge so I don't suffocate. There is a vent, but a small fan would have been \"cool.\" Felt very safe, locker for belongings. The staff, AMAZING! while they joked that they were not well taken care of by management, they took great pride in their work, and made every effort to accommodate any and all requests as I saw it. Extremely helpful and friendly when I asked directions or had questions. Available at all hours. Thank you guys for a memorable time in Edinburgh!",

          "reviewText": "I'm writing this review as a happy returning customer. ☺️ I've visited Edinburgh twice now and stayed at Kick Ass Grassmarket on both times. The first time I had a capsule bed in a mixed dorm room and on the second time we booked a twin room.\n\nI really liked the idea of a capsule bed for its privacy yet decent price and I feel like it matched my needs; provided a comfortable personal space with electric outlets and a safe locker for all my stuff.\n\nThe only issues with the capsule bed were a) climbing into it and b) lack of ventilation. The latter seemed to be manageable when sleeping towards the doorway of the bed when the window of the room is open (as well as the curtain on the doorway of the bed). However, my visit was during September so it might be harder to manage in summertime.\n\nWith the double room I shared with a friend I had no issues with. The bed and duvet were SO comfortable we marveled them multiple times.\n\nOn all my visits I've had a bathroom/shower next door to my room. There are also so many of them (a big bathroom with multiple private showers and in addition a whole bunch of one person mini bathroom/toilets) that I never had to wait for my turn. The showers are very simple and small, I suggest bringing the toiletry with you. There's also a bunch of stuff you can rent from the front desk if needed (towel, eg.)\n\nThe hostel also has a laundry room (with an iron and a dryer as well), a well equipped kitchen and a few comfortable lounge spaces. The receptions drinks are quite cheap and I've yet to have an issue they can't help me with.\n\nThe cleanlines off the hostel surprised me the first time I visited – it was the first time I stayed at a hostel overall! I'd say managing expectations is key here. There are so many people using many of the facilities at the same time that I don't find immaculate cleanliness realistic. There might be a fingerprint in the shower, a hair somewhere, or a clogged toilet here and there but everything gets fixed quick. Overall everything seemed very clean to me and I was happy to see the cleaners doing their rounds all the time multiple times a day (it seemed).\n\nObviously the location is spectacular. The lounge room and some rooms have a beautiful view of the Edinburgh Castle. It's literally the first thing you see when you step outside the door.\n\nThe grassmarket area has a lot of great cafes, bookstores and a few small markets for groceries, snacks and other small needs. A lot of the Pinterest-worthy locations (Victoria Street, Vennel Viewpoint, Greyfriars etc) are a only a few minute walk away. There's also a bus stop for all the major sightseeing buses across the street. A walk to the Royal Mile is around 5-10 minutes.\n\nOther things shortly:\n- Lockers before/after check out for a few bucks\n- Not noisy, at night the bathroom/room doors are an exception\n- A very minimal breakfast available for a few bucks\n- I recommend keeping the window open if possible\n- Be considerate of others when arriving at night (lights, noise)\n- The under pod locker fits a basic hand luggage\n- NO ELEVATOR! Prepare for 4 floors max.\n- Feels like home to me already <3",

Not a hostel for people with a disability. The one set of stairs are the only access. You’d be lucky to get out if there was an emergency. Fire springs to mind and the thought made me uneasy.\nCramming as many people as possible into a confined space feels like a money grab.\nThe website is very sleek and pretty. It has well photographed images. Unfortunately the reality is quite different.\nRooms are cramped with triple bunks and the room was stifling and stuffy. A light and electrical outlet in the bunk was a bonus. Communal kitchen small but functional. I missed breakfast which is included so can’t comment on that. I couldn’t wait to get out of there. Slept poorly due to street noise and poor ventilation.\nOverall a very disappointing experience one I won’t be repeating. Hard to recommend.",

Located at the bottom of Victoria Street, this hostel is a 2-10 minute walk from Victoria Street, the Royal Mile, the Edinburgh Castle, the University of Edinburgh, Grassmarket, Princes Street, and countless restaurants, shops, pubs, and bars. It is a little bit difficult to get to from the tram and bus stop, google maps takes you up and down multiple staircases and if you want to avoid them it does add about ten minutes to the walk.\n\nI stayed in a 4 bed female room, and the room was cute and well laid out, but not super clean. The floors had not been swept under the beds (I found a pair of slippers under my bed that had been there for who knows how long), I don't think the shelves had been cleaned because there was a pill left on my shelf, the sheets did have some hairs left on them, and the towel I was given had a stain. This is a hostel so my expectations on cleanliness are not super high, but I have stayed at far cleaner hostels.\n\nThere was a female bathroom on my floor, but it was quite a walk from the female only room (the male only bathroom was closer funny enough). The female bathroom is quite small; only two showers and two toilet stalls. The showers are teeny tiny, and there is no outer space to leave your clothes or change, only a small hook. I typically try to avoid mixed gender bathrooms, but I actually ended up using those instead of the female bathrooms because they were considerably bigger and cleaner. The female bathrooms I believe are only cleaned once a day early in the morning, so by evening they are not great.\n\nThe service was excellent, the front desk staff are there 24/7 and they are extremely kind and helpful. The bar is great, and there's activities every night of the week. It's a great hostel for meeting people and making friends! Overall, I would stay here again because the location for the price is pretty unbeatable, and the social aspect was phenomenal, but I think it could definitely use some more cleaning.",

We arrived at 11pm, quite late at night, there is always someone ready to attend you for whatever you may need. We had the chance to get to know James, the receptionist, a little bit, he's such a kind and funny soul, he recommended us lots of places to go and we spoke about each other's travels, if you get to just spend a few minutes with him, he's just a really  nice fella! We slept in a mixed dorm, it was perfect, had everything you may need:bedding included, charging station, lockers (towels are for renting if you need them). Every floor has bathrooms, some just for female or men and others for both so you can just choose where you prefer to go. They were always clean and as there are many we never had problems of too much waiting. We had breakfast included, it was really great they offer many options: hardboiled eggs, bread, ham, cheese, butter, jam, croissant, yogurt, cornflakes, oat, fruit like apples and bananas, coffee, milk, orange juice, tea, tap water (which you can drink and it's really good). The position is really strategic, in the middle of the Old Town, just a minute from the stunning Victoria Street and a few minutes more from Royal Mile. We were able to visit the city just walking, I recommend comfortable shoes, Edimburgh is full of stairs and streets that go up and down. When I'll come back I will definitely stay again here.\nThank you lass!\nArrivederci👋🏻🇮🇹🫂✨️",

          "reviewText": "Me and my aunt just stayed in this beautiful hostel for 4 nights. It's the perfect solution if you want to save money, get to know other travellers and visit the city. We arrived at 11pm, quite late at night, there is always someone ready to attend you for whatever you may need. We had the chance to get to know James, the receptionist, a little bit, he's such a kind and funny soul, he recommended us lots of places to go and we spoke about each other's travels, if you get to just spend a few minutes with him, he's just a really  nice fella! We slept in a mixed dorm, it was perfect, had everything you may need:bedding included, charging station, lockers (towels are for renting if you need them). Every floor has bathrooms, some just for female or men and others for both so you can just choose where you prefer to go. They were always clean and as there are many we never had problems of too much waiting. We had breakfast included, it was really great they offer many options: hardboiled eggs, bread, ham, cheese, butter, jam, croissant, yogurt, cornflakes, oat, fruit like apples and bananas, coffee, milk, orange juice, tea, tap water (which you can drink and it's really good). The position is really strategic, in the middle of the Old Town, just a minute from the stunning Victoria Street and a few minutes more from Royal Mile. We were able to visit the city just walking, I recommend comfortable shoes, Edimburgh is full of stairs and streets that go up and down. When I'll come back I will definitely stay again here.\nThank you lass!\nArrivederci👋🏻🇮🇹🫂✨️",

Rooms are quite modern and clean.\nI think there aren't enough bathrooms around the hostel, the one next to the 30-bed dorm had only two toilets and two showers, and nearby there was another one with two showers and only one toilet, which was also out of order.\nAlso there isn't a kitchen, but they said there is a kitchen we can use in a building 4 mins away. Curtains around the bed would be a great addition too.\n\nOverall I still recommend it considering the good location and price.",

Private rooms are fine and quiet except for the partiers on the street but it didn't really bother us. Bathroom situation isn't great. There are four bathrooms on a floor (one male, one female, two any gender). Two showers in each? This does make showering difficult but ya know it is a hostel. Also one of the showers was broken for the beginning of our stay. Sinks in the women's bathroom wouldn't drain so backed up when the water was on for any period of time. Apparently the bathrooms are checked three times a day but we noticed things consistently being missed: trash on the ground, toilet paper not changed, soap out. Bathrooms are not very big so it can be a bit of a traffic jam. Obviously lots of people = lots of smells so just be wary of that.\n\nFelt safe. Not sure if I would stay again but for the price? Maybe.",

Quite frankly whoever owns this hovel has not maintained or replaced anything in a long time. It was more unhygienic to use the showers than not shower at all and so I please spend a little bit extra rather than slumming it in these conditions.

Different sizes of pitches available, we stayed on the smallest hardstanding elec hook up 1 night which was just over £20 and we revisited a few nights later and stayed on a larger hardstanding elec hook up with privacy hedges which was a little over £30. Discount is ofgered if booking a further stay too. The site is very clean and very well kept. The Toilet blocks are the best ive seen so far, all having toilets cubicles, showers cubicles, hair dryers, rooms with baths, wash basins in some toiket cubicles too. laundry room, kitchen room with microwave and vending machines. Toilet blocks even have rooms with full size baths too!. Music filtered throughout toilet/bathing blocks. Beautiful childrens play area and even a dedicated dog walking route around the perimeter of the site which is hedged and fenced. Dedicated doggy wash area for your mucky pups. Camp fires allowed if hiring correct firepit/wood direct from site for £15. Staff very friendly and helpful. Superb site",

By speaking to her directly we booked options to support the needs of the team e.g. number of rooms, bathorooms, facilities like a dishwasher, also to understand local delivery options, the free shuttle bus to a local pub, and create a seamless stay. The site is immaculate, as was the accommodation. Two thoughts - we couldn't figure out how to turn the heating off e.g. towel rails in bathrooms so had to open windows which felt a bit of a waste. Perhaps some guidance on that in the booklet? And one bit of advice for guests is to bring ear-plugs if a light sleeper as you are under the flight-path which runs quite late. A great find, happy customers thank you!",

There are plenty of water taps around for clean water. The facilities block was generally very clean and well maintained.

The nearby road is also separated off by a hedge which blocks most noise and we didn't find it an issue at all. There is no provision for children but they can play games or cycle around pretty safely. There is a large supermarket close by and some eateries and a brewery tap room.

There was a power cut on our last day which meant cold showers but that didn't deter us too much. Overall it was decent and would recommend to anyone trying to save a bit of cash at the fringe festival",

Key training equipment (with no alternative for the muscle group) is left broken for almost 5 months. If you’re working with a legitimate professional trainer (not the Village staff) they’ll be struggling to adjust your plan. Critical machines are consistently out of order. Staff simply blame Technogym (the equipment manufacturer and take zero responsibility). The machines are old, dated and very tired and worn as I’ve used Technogym equipment in other gyms and it’s significantly better and way more modern. Village have clearly been going cheap on the equipment and maint contract. No supervision. Amateur gym users handling the machines stupidly and violently, inevitably contributing to the constant break downs. There’s so much plate slamming. It’s frustrating when Village PT staff are in and walking around but they don’t intervene with these people. They just leave everyone to their thing and ignore the basics. Paper Towels and cleaning Spray after often not restocked. The changing rooms, lockers and toilets are not open at 5am when the gym opens. This is because it gives access to the pool which isn’t open at that time. Still a pain for gym goers when it’s already failing to be open 24 hours. They are also filthy when they are open so I’ll do pretty much anything I can to avoid them. Sadly, the stairway to the gym smells like a sewer by 6am+ as there’s no ventilation there and too many sweaty patrons using the mini lockers at the bottom . I’ve complained to staff, management and even Village HQ about the broken key equipment for over 4 months and no changed or adjustments are made. There’s a pretence of care in their emails but this hasn’t let to anything being fixed. Overall, this place is dressed up and presented as a premium quality gym, and the price is really high but my partner and I will be cancelling our membership shortly as nothing could be further from the truth. Oh yeah, they also want 3 months notice after the full year. They’ll happily take your money but they really couldn’t care less about the actual gym. My advice: look beyond the fresh pull up banners and posters and don’t subscribe to this gym. It’s seriously neglected and the contract is exploitative.",

I would avoid stairs as it was to painful. My consultant said swimming or aqua fitness would help as it takes to pressure off my knees and feet.\nI’ve been going to Glasgow village for over a year now. Vivian’s class has helped me so much. I still have difficulty with stairs but I don’t avoid them now. I do aqua fitness twice a week as there’s only two classes. Monday & Wednesday. Myself and the other members who attend have been asking for a long time if they could add another class on a Friday, but so far no joy. The two classes are so popular the I have to set my alarm for midnight the week before each class to get a place. There’s always 4or5 members that disappointed and don’t get a place in the class. So the demand is definitely there as the class is so popular. If a Friday class was added then most of the members would be accommodated and no one would be disappointed. Plus personally I’d benefit from three days a week. The members who attend the aqua have said the gym is changing a lot of the classes come January. I really do hope they don’t change the aqua fitness, only change I’d like is a third class please.\nI’ve now added a squat & deadlift class on a Wednesday with Adam. A lovely young man. There’s 9 of us attending regularly aged roughly 55-75 years. All females. It’s quite intimidating for a female of my age (66) with obvious disabilities to enter a gym , but this small weights class has been amazing. Adam makes sure we’re lifting safely. He is very patient but also has a great sense of when to push us when we need to it.\nOverall I’m very glad I’ve joined the Village, and the classes are amazing, the instructors awesome.\nThank you 🏋️‍♀️🏊🏋️‍♀️🏊🏋️‍♀️🏊🏋️‍♀️",

She treated me unfairly compared to other guests. I personally observed other guests being provided with two towels without issue, whereas my request for the same was denied. When I asked to see the policy governing the one-towel restriction, Holly refused and arrogantly stated, “This is my club, and I make the rules.”\n\nIt is beyond comprehension how an establishment with an international reputation employs managerial staff so evidently lacking in professionalism, training, and basic etiquette. This situation demands immediate and serious attention.",

I signed up for the membership because of the proximity but in the last four months I didn’t visit the place more than 10 days. There is literally nothing to look forward to.\nBroken sauna room, (never open in the course of the past four months),  a jacuzzi with a lot of chlorine it will pull off healthy skin, steam room open and close often times, even when it’s working it’s untidy and suffocating.\nWhat actually pushed me to to leave this review tho is the rude customer service. There is this staff member who I constantly see arguing with visitors. We were  in the jacuzzi waiting for it to start and the two staff at the counter would look at us and laugh in mockery. After waiting for about an hr for the jacuzzi to start bubbling I had to ask one of them when it’s about to start and he shows me a 10 min wait sign. I waited with other people of course and some had to leave and then when I see it’s just useless to just sit and wait my kid asked me to take her to a bathroom, I took her to a Beth room and when we come back it was starting. One of the staff members had the nerve to tell me here it started (right after an hr and some minutes) I looked surprised and he was pissed. He knocked the window in anger and wanted to speak with me furiously. I met him half way went to the counter and told him that was just mean with a straight face unbothered face. To that he had to reply there are signage at three places for you guys not to sit on the bubble tubes and all. I went to my friend in the pull and told her to scoot over, but no he shows me another gentleman who was on the other side of the pull, well hows that my responsibility.\nWe experience racism daily basis it’s not something new but racism with ignorance at its best is served at this broken facility.\nThe changing room is stinky and broken to make the matter worse there is this staff member who makes visits and says to our faces hmm something smells and she goes ahead and asks other customers do you smell something to which the customers reply no but then she keeps coming to a point of making some people uncomfortable to a point of leaving the premises. It’s a joke. I am not paying a dime more to be treated like that.",

I joined primarily due to the one person per lane rule, so it's not a struggle for space and you don't feel like you are in someone else's way while trying to swim.  And the Turkish spa is a relaxing area to spend some time afterward.  The staff is also really friendly and helpful.\n\nSome other reviewers are pushing for updates to the space, but the charm really is in the history of the establishment.  They've been progressively making appropriate updates, more recently to changing rooms and shower areas - but while some things may seem old fashioned, I think it only adds to the experience.",

You can always hog one of the limited squat racks with flat bars for your calisthenics though. 🤦‍♂️\n\nFinally one of the benches I used had sweat marks on it with a spray bottle to clean it but no towel.\n\nI just don't see how this gym justifies the price it asks or why it's so popular.

The general pool was dip for children of their swimming level and the safe guard was strict  but had never told me that the 1 m  pool can be opened for the request. So I presume it is just the management policy. Boys were upset and I had to take them home after just 15 min of staying. Thank you for the opportunity to use the best sport facilities in Europe.",

Then we were told it was just a lie to get everyone out so they could get the swimming lessons on earlier so they could leave earlier! My little girl was so upset as she wasn't getting back on the slide. The two main slides were not on as they were understaffed. Then the 'life gaurd   ' was too busy watching to make sure no one tried to get in the smaller pool and wasn't paying attention to anyone in the big pool. Absolutely terrible how he treated all the kids getting them all out the pool promising they would be allowed back in. Will NOT be going back to this pool again  it's no way to treat paying customers!",

However, if cardio isn't the only thing you're interested in, you're not going to get much out of this gym. While the first floor has been revamped with brand new cardio machines (which never seem to be full - not even 50% in use), the lower power play/weightlifting level is incredibly cramped and underkept. The gym also has the fewest isolation machines I have ever seen in any gym - less than a handful for upper and lower body.\n\nLike many others have pointed out, a huge portion of the weightlifting area has been closed off for over a year, with seemingly no plans to fix the situation which isn't only an inconvenience but also a security threat. Peak hours are therefore extremely busy - it's difficult to walk past corridors; there's little to no benches, squat racks or even empty space to work out due to how crowded it gets. Bathrooms also haven't been re-done in years, it seems. There's always issues with the shower, and hygiene isn't the best.\n\nLately the gym has also been closed for several days at a time due to strikes, so we can't even use the service we have paid for. I feel bad for the staff, since some people are so lovely, but upper management seems to not care about the state of the gym at all. It's funny how membership prices have gone up but no relevant improvements have been made.

Could be cleaner, showers could be better but take your pool slides, big bag for wet stuff and 20ps for hair dryers and you're sorted. If you want to sunbathe, bring your own seats as not many available.",

Changing facilities are OK and use £1 coin deposit. The music is a bit deafening in the changing area but less so outside. Pool area outside is OK. Great views even in poor weather. Pool is warm and salt water and makes for an enjoyable swim. There is a good deep end (3.5m) which you don’t often see in more modern pools with spring board and platform. Would definitely travel the hour there and back to visit again.",

Changing rooms and showers are a bit chaotic when busy but overall place was clean and lovely to see both flumes open again. Whirlpool is a ton of fun, lazy river with slides is great too and the wave machine is fantastic. Didn’t do the big tornado donut slide but kids loved it. They also love the huge water play area (where you can fire water at unsuspecting folk below). Cafe was open again too which was lovely to see (slushies and cakes were hoovered - also has hot food). As other people have noted, do bear in mind it is an old attraction now so it will look a bit worn around the edges and could use a bit of TLC on the rust spots but given its age that wasn’t a major thing for us. All in an absolutely fantastic day, lots of giggles and could have stayed much longer. Would recommend trying to go at non-peak times to get the best of the main features.",

          "reviewText": "I have wanted to visit here for soooo long! Finally got the perfect excuse and brought my best friend for her birthday. We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

I must say we were blown away by the whole experience more queens club than David Lloyd’s and with bells on . This lido was refurbished and reopened to the public in 2007 . Architecturally beautiful and lovingly restored with incredible attention to detail from the pool side cubicle changing curtains to the tasteful period furniture in the upper floors . The members and staff , friendly and charming shared their special place with us and we very much appreciated . Pool , steam , sauna and jacuzzi left us refreshed and ready for breakfast. Changing rooms and shower  areas were super clean and tidy . Then to breakfast well !!! This was another level and unexpected , ibérico chop with Catalan beans duck egg , morcilla and membrillo was a Hispanic combination I would have only expected to find in heaven , congratulations to the genius who pulled that baby to the pass at menu development . As in many cases sadly wonderful food not matched by service , would you like some toast with that or anything else we can get you would have been nice and a simple upsell , regardless come to expect these things and move on albeit annoying. Having said that the food quality setting and environment made for one of the most memorable breakfast. Thank you .",

The toilets regularly smell of pee, and the changing room is tiny and also not cleaned very often.  In the gym TVs or headphone connections don’t work often....the entire place needs a big overhaul. Manager and staff are lovely and helpful but staff do not seem to have the power to arrange cleaning by housekeeping staff. Also the car park is often full so I’ve been unable to use the gym several times a week recently. When I asked about this I was told that nearby office workers pay to use the car park and the hotel management don’t try and limit this as they make money from the car park, so this means that gym guests and hotel guests don’t get to park at times. I’d expect more from the Hilton, this is not 5 star standards.",

Male toilets are clean and fresh with adjacent showers and changing area with lockers for padlocks available. Next to this their is an accessible toilet\n\nThe entire gym is split into a few different areas, as you walk in you are greeted with an open space with some cool tables/chairs and a sofa and of course a huge OmniGym sign on the wall. The ground floor has a huge amount of upper and lower free weights and cable machines, a fresh new dumbbell area with plenty of benches. The downstairs is bright and full of natural light with the windows south facing, unlike some gyms who have that old unwashed warehouse style with loads of artificial lights.\nThere is an open space room which is going to be available for sports therapists to utilise and to also train in as part of clients programs.\n\nI should point out that the majority of equipment is all brand spanking new and the most of the weight machines are all Primal which is highly considered to be the best in the business!\n\nUpstairs has the majority of all the cardio equipment split by a wall and a multi-purpose room for classes. It also boasts another dumbbell weights area and over 10 squat racks, 2 sleds/1 torq tank, this area is a Hyrox competitors dream workout area, with ample room for short sprints and station based group sessions.\n\nThe building is red bricked and  it's matched by a contemporary modern ivory concrete floor with painted metal around the first floor. Mirrors are plenty for those wanting to capture the workout or just add to the gram!\n\nThe staff are polite, the PTs offer individual and different styles of programmes, some are former world champions in various different bikini/swimsuit/bodybuilding competitions. Some are into obstacle courses, some Hyrox and all I'd imagine will coach general fitness/weight loss!\n\nAll in all this looks like it's going to be an amazing gym full of people of all shapes and sizes, on all types of fitness journeys, if this place is anything like NFA then it will have a great community feel about this place, which is just one of the things that makes this gym stand out from others in the city!\n\nI would highly recommend you try this place out, there are some amazing offers on currently!",

Definitely asset to the business.\n\nGym itself was fantastic. All the equipment to workout and spacious. The walls’ colours (decor) were spot on and cleanliness to high standards. Motivation for work out comes naturally at this gym (well at least for me). Showers were clean and well looked after.\n\nOverall highly recommend this gym to give it a try if someone is thinking to join.",

Today, I took part in my first BodyPump class, led by a trainer named Fiona — and I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction.\n\nFrom the moment the session began, Fiona was attentive and supportive. She immediately recognised that it was my first time and made a consistent effort to ensure I was following along safely and confidently. At the end of the class, she approached me to congratulate me on completing the session — a gesture I genuinely appreciated. In a group of around 30 participants, her ability to provide personal guidance, especially to newcomers, was impressive and speaks volumes about her professionalism and care.\n\nI also want to acknowledge a fellow participant to my left who offered quiet support throughout and took the time afterwards to encourage me. That small exchange really reinforced the sense of community and support within the class — it’s not just the trainers who have your back, but the members too.\n\nThe gym itself is excellent: spacious, well-equipped, and thoughtfully laid out. There’s a great range of machines, hot and cold showers, filtered water stations, vending machines stocked with essentials like pre-workout, and even a sauna — which I’ve yet to try but look forward to using in the future.\n\nTypically, I struggle with motivation after a few weeks of training, but I find myself genuinely looking forward to each visit to JD. That, I believe, is the difference here.\n\nHighly recommended — 10/10.\n\nThank you, Fiona, for your dedication and for making new members feel seen, supported, and encouraged. It makes all the difference.",

The \"Farm shop\" is nothing of the sort, and perhaps even more outrageously priced than you'd expect - it's lovely to look around, though, and if you're on a long trip then the Kitchen is definitely worth it - far better than a maccies or BK, though you are going to be paying for the difference, rest assured.\n\nThere's a decent amount of reliable fairly rapid EV charging at industry standard rates, without a ridiculously large pre-authorisation, which is really nice to see. My car has a 62kw battery, and I rarely do more than top up 25% on the rapid charger, so it's infuriating to have to pay a 45 or 60 quid preauth - especially if the transaction errors and you have to do it twice! Thankfully, Westmoreland chargers not only have a low start fee, but if the connection to the car or the payment update errors, it regonises that and doesn't place a second preauth on the same card.\n\nFantastic coffee, really great -- but with their milk supplier being Mossgiel, and the coffee coming from Thompsons, that'd be hard to muck up. However, they did manage to muck it up in one way... DON'T buy a flat white; ask for a latte in a flat white cup... You'll get the exact same thing, but cheaper. Yes, they've applied vanity pricing to a flat white, charging you more for less.\n\nPricewise the only properly value for money thing you can buy from Cairn Lodge, is....Yep, the aforementioned EV charging.\n\nHaving said that, you can use the showers for free, and dogs are allowed in the central bit (not the shop or kitchen/restaurant) so there are some positives to outweigh the remortgage-inducing prices.",

The hostel charged me multiple times for the same stay, twice by the time I booked it, but then I got one of the transactions cancelled upon complaining to my credit card company. Then, when I arrived for check-in, even though the property had already charged my card (pre-authorization, but that already kept the amount from my account), they said that I had not paid. I showed them my bank extract, the receptionist called the finance sector and they authorized my check in, but then they charged my card AGAIN! At that point I had not much money left and really needed the money (that they wrongly charged twice again) back. I called Booking support, was informed that the property was the one dealing with the payment and not booking, and therefore they couldn't help me at all. Then I got desperate and started crying, and only after that a staff member helped me, issuing a refund for the night. I am very thankful for this person who helped me.\n\nThe reason for my overall score for this property is due to some other issues I found:\nThe bedroom was on the 3rd floor of an enormous building, and there was no elevator available. It was quite hard to climb all the stairs carrying my luggage, especially after such stress for checking in.\nThere was no soap/shampoo/body wash in the bathroom for guests use. There was no power outlet close to the bunk bed I was assigned with. Even though the location was close to a nice park, it was quite far away from the city center for walking.",

The beds themselves were comfortable though. The showers are the smallest I’ve ever used in a hostel, you can barely move around which was frustrating. The stairs were such a pain, I stayed on the third floor and getting my luggage up there was a task. I understand it is a very old building but still, it would not be good for someone with mobility issues. On the plus side, the common areas were nice and the staff were always helpful. It is in an area a bit tucked away from the city, but still feels very nice and safe.",

Only two showers for God knows how many people (maybe 80 to 100). There are literally only two plugs in the room for everyone to use, so forget about charging your devices. The hygiene level is at the lowest possible standard in every way. Staff seem non-existent, with the receptionist busy doing another job with online meetings on his laptop, and extremely unwelcoming. I made the mistake of not trusting the reviews and spending a night here. Never again. I also noticed that the owner replying rudely to others so hopefully he can comment on the rats in his hostel.",

Room was spotless, really comfy bed and toilet and shower room really clean. No tea or coffee  in room but irrelevant as this is available on reception. Iron Room on ever floor.

When we arrived, we were told we couldn’t get out of our car to check in due to a medical emergency inside (obviously this is not a problem!), we were told the staff would come to us when we were able to check in, approx 10 minutes. We ended up waiting over half an hour in the car in the middle of a storm, nobody ever came to speak to us again and we saw 2 or 3 separate couples over 10 minutes able to go into the reception and come out with keys, we had to speak to the guests to ask what was happening, they told us they’d been allowed to check in and weren’t even aware of any issue/delay, so not sure why we were still being made to wait and there was no communication from the staff after initially being told we couldn’t go in, this ended up making us late to an event we were going to after driving 4 and a half hours and ensuring we arrived earlier than needed. The stay over night was OK for the price the bed was comfy enough and the room was big, the shower was nice, however the room itself was extremely cold even with the radiators on full heat, I could barely sleep due to this. Then the next morning when we came to leave, we have noticed scratches and damage to our car and a plank of wood that has clearly fallen off the building and hit the car, we immediately alerted staff who were largely unhelpful for about half an hour, they informed us it had been repaired recently and must have fallen off in the storm, obviously they can’t control the weather but the “repair” had clearly not been completed to a good enough standard if parts of the building are literally falling off, they were completely unable to offer us any sort of resolution to the damage. We eventually had to leave to start the journey home so we asked for an email and managers details to contact them about the damage, we sent this email immediately when arriving home that day, and a week later we have still not had a response to the email.",

I had informed the team at Social Hub of my partners birthday to see if anything could be done and we had come in to such a pleasant surprise with a handwritten note and some drink. The people who worked at the front helping with self check in were also so kind and patient with our lack of tech skills. The hotel is in a great location and all around was great. The only downside was people screaming outside the window in the street and we were on the 7th floor yet it sounded like they were just outside. Of course this can’t be controlled so nothing against the hotel, but this was a Monday night so just as a heads up for if people are coming for work that there is the potential for this.

I've now visited Cashel at length quite a few times and have a good feel for it.  Most basically, the location is spectacular, right on the east shore of gorgeous Loch Lomond. looking west across it with unobstructed views, along an usually nice section of coast.  The more I've stayed here, the more I've come to appreciate what a treasure Loch Lomond is (for someone who lives in Glasgow and used to take it for granted).  The premium campsites are only 10-15 feet from the water.  From there, one is in a great position to enjoy the constantly changing sky and water, in their infinite forms, along with all the wildlife, including humans, that frequent the Loch.  I've seen hundreds of geese swimming north at dusk, heading up the Loch to moult, and then return the way they came a month later, back to the farm next door where they graze in fields, easily accessible by turnstile.  And then there are the contemplative paddle boarders at dawn on water of glass, not to mention the cold water swimmers in the spring.  Another great feature of this campsite is the wonderful staff.  They run a great facility and are always happy to serve and chat with a smile.  They take considerable pride in the site and go to considerable lengths to maintain it well for the safety, wellbeing, and enjoyment of their guests.  And then there are the amasing campers from all of over the world, camping in every conceivable way, with the diverse community changing daily, including many tent campers walking the West Highland Way.  On a nice weekend, it's a little like being at a festival, although the staff insists that things quiet down by 10pm.  Cashel Campsite is VERY popular, especially with the locals, so reserve early.  I couldn't recommend a campsite more highly.  IMHO it's a privilege to stay here.",

Also Heather in the arcade was super helpful and friendly and kind, james(I'm sure) the trooper was so good with the kids and many more staff members were great but I didn't catch names sorry, security staff were very friendly and sound.\n\nEntertainment: was a bit hit and miss tbh but we made the most of it we seen the db dukes who were brilliant and kept everyone entertained and happy.\n\nActivities: we done, archery, milkshake mornings, battle blasters, halloween pottery, the big inflatable suits all of these were fantastic and well worth the money I recommend buying the activities pass saves a good bit of money. We also done swimming once, pool was warm but small.\n\nFacilities: small but decent enough site, toilets in show bar weren't the cleanest tbh and need upgrading, swimming pool was fine but the changing area was terrible, 4 showers isnt enough and also which were freezing cold and low pressure also some cubicles didnt lock as would open when locked,arcade was ok but toys always got stuck and don't waste money on grab machines. Everything in general needs upgrading but was still OK for a cheap break.\n\nCaravan: well we got Livingston way 5min uphill walk to entertainment, 2 bedrooms which is not what we expected for a family of 5(we booked through sun holidays) sofa bed was disgusting(period blood and urine stains) and had to move furniture to pull it out, our son ended up sleeping on the sofa the full stay, we did request a new mattress and sheets and pillows as we wernt provided these for my son, we got the sheets and pillows at half 10 on the first night after having to call out of hours number. The girl on reception acted like it was no big deal and it was near end of shift so she couldn't be bothered. The rest of the caravan was decent for what we paid.\n\nOverall we had a good holiday. If the things I have mentioned are sorted and updated we would happy return.",

I cant use a normal disabled toilet. I walked in and asked where the toilet was and the security officer said they didn't have one and told us try the sports village at the other end. I then went to someone standing next to the bollards and asked him he said there's an event on we cant let you in. I explained I have stoma and crohns and colitis and need urgent access as well as I also need a wee but can't do it in a normal disabled toilet and my app said there is one here. He didn't know if there was and said because there is an event on no ones allowed in and that i should use the disabled toilet which doesnt have a hoist which i wouldnt be able to transfer safely. They turned me away I went to my car and double checked my app and came back in and showed them the picture of the changing places toilets and that it claimed it was here. It was then they admitted it was there and that it was in the changing room area. I said I don't want to swim I need the toilet and you can't deny me my right to use public toilet especially when I have a stoma due to crohns and colitis and especially when I cant transfer normally to a normal disabled toilet. I asked to speak to manager whom came out and straight away said I could use it without any issues like those security officers gave me. He told me though the hoist doesn't work so my wife had to let me use my bedpan we luckily brought with us which was humiliating and I had to lay on the plastic bed in order to wee. It was humiliating and it was disgraceful. Your staff should be taught that no matter what special event is happening if I need to use the nearest changing places disabled toilet which has a hoist in it and especially people whom can't use a normal disabled toilet and has a serious condition like crohns and colitis and has stoma due to this condition needs urgent use of toilet which suits their needs. Failure to allow me access which was the case at 1st is illegal and discriminating. It goes against the disability equality act. Shame on you I will never be back. Have a word with your staff and highlight the importance and discrimination and I hope in future they won't stop other people like me their right to use a toilet suitable for their needs. Disgusting and shocking behaviour.",

I’ve had to change whatever session I do and accommodate to something else because there’s groups of people using the cable machine for like 30+min or the racks. And honestly I tried everything, I first trying to go earlier that 6 am and it is busy, now I’m going around 6 pm because it’s going to be busy anyways, but at least I get more sleep. They need to put a cap on the members. I was super excited to join because it is the only gym in Aberdeen to have a hip thrust machine, but I can barely use it because it’s so packed. And forget about setting your barbell and plates, that’s space is also being used.\nAdditionally, the app doesn’t even tell you how many members are at the gym, they even changed it and now it doesn’t even tell you what cardio machines are empty so you could tell if it’s packed or not. It’s actually kind of pointless to even have an app at this point.\nThe changing rooms, the showers and the toilets are usually really clean. But there are some members that think they own the place and they leave their stuff all around, like leaving their clothes in the cubicles while they’re showering.\nAnd yes, I could potentially change gyms, but unfortunately for me Im stuck here for multiple reasons.",

I rediscovered how satisfying and focused a workout at a gym can be, and wanted the benefits regularly—also as a 'third space' where I could keep fit but also work remotely as needed.\n\nThe pricing certainly sent me looking elsewhere for a while, and I tried three other gyms, two of which were out in Westhill. In terms of pricing these were quite literally 25-30% the cost of David Lloyd and 'did the job'. Unfortunately, I sensed that the ambience at some of these gyms and the 'bonuses' like swimming pool and sauna were lacking, and likely to make me less keen to visit often, which is pretty important just to form the habit of going. Right enough, I go a few times a week and can spend upwards of 3 hours there working out and also getting on with work quite comfortably.\n\nOverall, even after trying other gyms, I could see that the whole experience at David Lloyd made the higher price point worthwhile for me. For those looking for a simpler gym experience or who won't spend too long there, it may not be so attractive in terms of value.\n\nSo why 4 stars?\n\nWell, (1), clearly there's no sense complaining about price when you went for the premium option but I do think here that it's just a touch far for most people considering the price points of perfecly good competing gyms. I certainly hope prices remain as they are and don't go up with CPI too eagerly.\n\n(2), there are often enough petty complaints to find! For example the weights often seem to be placed onto racks in a disorderly way, which leaves me with the impression that the plates are not often tidied in any 'set' way. We don't need 1.25kg plates on the hack squat machine for example... I've jumped in the shower before and had it fail to run warm (though this was admittedly a one-off). It's pretty often the case that one of the two straighteners available in the women's changing areas fail to work, and that's not ideal when these are in high demand at peak times—why can't every station have straighteners, and they should be replaced as soon as they fail.\n\n(3), their registration system can be seriously buggy at times. SMS verification can fail to function, leading to lots of confusion and waiting for codes to be sent around. Giving someone a guest pass can be way more hassle than it needs to be. Get used to the usual rubbish of setting passwords, accessing emails, entering forms repeatedly... Rubbish! Better if the guest pass was shareable instantly without all this bureaucracy and friction. It can be seriously off-putting as a first impression for guests. Also, it would be great if guests could use the courts too without surcharge. I think that's a reasonable expectation for the price and frequency of the inclusive guest passes. Nobody wants to be paying extra after forking out for the Platinum membership.\n\nBesides this though, it's the best gym I know of and have tried in the area, and for me is ultimately worthwhile. It's certainly made me comfortable going often and spending hours at a time. It never gets 'too busy'. Finally, the money is certainly reinvested as the place is looking really fantastic after the renovation. If you want a premium gym and third space, and understand the benefits you're getting for your money, I do recommend the place!",

It's pretty often the case that one of the two straighteners available in the women's changing areas fail to work, and that's not ideal when these are in high demand at peak times—why can't every station have straighteners, and they should be replaced as soon as they fail.\n\n(3), their registration system can be seriously buggy at times. SMS verification can fail to function, leading to lots of confusion and waiting for codes to be sent around. Giving someone a guest pass can be way more hassle than it needs to be. Get used to the usual rubbish of setting passwords, accessing emails, entering forms repeatedly... Rubbish! Better if the guest pass was shareable instantly without all this bureaucracy and friction. It can be seriously off-putting as a first impression for guests. Also, it would be great if guests could use the courts too without surcharge. I think that's a reasonable expectation for the price and frequency of the inclusive guest passes. Nobody wants to be paying extra after forking out for the Platinum membership.\n\nBesides this though, it's the best gym I know of and have tried in the area, and for me is ultimately worthwhile. It's certainly made me comfortable going often and spending hours at a time. It never gets 'too busy'. Finally, the money is certainly reinvested as the place is looking really fantastic after the renovation. If you want a premium gym and third space, and understand the benefits you're getting for your money, I do recommend the place!",

This included a back, neck, and shoulder massage, then we spent time in the pool, sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi, finishing off the day with a cheeky Prosseco and a fruit scone. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave us our spa day bag that included a robe and towel (that we had to return at the end of the day), and a pair of flip flops. The massage was very enjoyable, just what you would expect for a refreshing 30 min treatment. My back feels great after that.\nThe only criticisms are that the pool area is a bit grubby. The ceiling tiles are mostly moldy and various fixtures and fittings could really do with a clean/replacement. It's hard to fully relax when surrounded by dirt and mold. The changing rooms and generally signage etc are also looking a bit tired and well used. If you are paying £50/60 per month for membership, I'd expect things to look a bit more modern, or at least clean. The floor and showers etc were clean, in fact they were being cleaned as we were there, but it's all the stuff out of reach that has mold and dirt. Even some of the walls were cracking or falling apart.\nI will definitely use the facilities again, as I didn't get chance to check out the gym upstairs. But yeah, overall a pleasant experience, but could be improved if the place was freshened up a bit and the flickering lights were fixed. Have a great day!",

We had the most amazing morning-the pool was not busy but it was a cooler day than some. We arrived about 10am on a Sat morning. Plenty of space to swim-lovely and warm once we got in but could have been a little warmer for us.. Great to have the showers on site and change facilities if required too. We had a lovely coffee from the on site catering van -highly recommend..\nWe returned today to try the restaurant and were not disappointed. We had really lovely meals. I can recommend the house salad ,it was not just a pile of lettuce leaves with the usual chunks of tomato and cucumber but a delectable plate of finely mixed ingredients and gorgeous dressing -well worth the price and even  though the restaurant was busy over the lunch time and had a 'kitchen crisis' it still felt very relaxing. The staff are amazing and seemed to be really enjoying their job... There is lots more to try and we have already made a booking for a family birthday celebration.\nWe will be back very soon Saltdean Lido as there is more to explore...",

So I was looking for a gym which was situated closer to home. I did not realise until searching online that this gym was in Inverurie so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nObviously it is not as big as pyregym, but it does have all the equipment which I need. The showers are great and the changing room was clean. However I only used it once, preferring to shower at home. I attend at about 5:30 in the morning and at that time there is no music, which I like. But at 6:00am the music is turned on. I guess I need to purchase some headphones. Lol.\n\nStaff seem very friendly. Good gym and would recommend.",

The so called lorry park is in a newly commercialised area busy with small vans and cars of every stripe with their random parking making the manoeuvring of any truck rig almost impossible. I sacrificed an hour of tachograph time leaving before it was going to be impossible to exit the place. The owner has spread his bets with the usage of the space but the truck driver is hugely disadvantaged. The toilets and showers were clean and tidy but the cafe food looked expensive at £8+ for some kind of burger dish. The place is best avoided in my opinion.",

          "reviewText": "£20 for unlocked truck parking. 7/8 tight spaces for artics but my road train was a pig to get into and particularly out from. The so called lorry park is in a newly commercialised area busy with small vans and cars of every stripe with their random parking making the manoeuvring of any truck rig almost impossible. I sacrificed an hour of tachograph time leaving before it was going to be impossible to exit the place. The owner has spread his bets with the usage of the space but the truck driver is hugely disadvantaged. The toilets and showers were clean and tidy but the cafe food looked expensive at £8+ for some kind of burger dish. The place is best avoided in my opinion.",

Dropping one star on service because breakfast was 8-11am, but when I appeared at 8am on the Saturday, they were still settling out and the cooked food was not ready.  I had a bus to catch! Otherwise, the buffet breakfast was tasty and plentiful.\n\nThe building and paintwork are a bit tired, but for the price, this is an observation, not a complaint. I paid £180 for three nights B&B.

Staff is always friendly. The only downside to St Peters is the lack of recreational room, however, I believe this could be modified by allowing students a keycard which granted access to the Old Fire Station's extensive and evidently favoured social area.

I was lucky enough to not be in a room facing King Street, but if you are the noise is horrible because the windows don't block the sound out and the insulation is awful.\nThe rooms are pretty ugly and dated, breeze block and again inadequately insulated. In the winter it's unbearably cold because of this and the heaters barely work, turning on for only 5-10 minutes at a time. I know people who bought extra heaters to try and alleviate this got them taken from them.\nThe bathroom fan in ensuite rooms doesn't work really, so it's constantly humid in there. Black mould therefore grows within days, and it's impossible to keep it clean. You never feel clean after having a shower as a result. Also you can't drink the water from taps in the ensuite bathrooms.\nTo top it all off, the cold in the bedroom also causes black mould to grow. I had black mould growing around my window, something that seemed to be a problem in almost every room in our flat, to horrific levels in some (see photos). After returning from Christmas break, I discovered to my absolute horror that there was black mould growing on the underside of my mattress (see photos). This is a serious health hazard, but despite this I had to ask staff THREE separate times to replace my mattress. The last time I was in tears, I called them around midnight. I think they expected me to sleep on a mouldy mattress. Later they told me to open my windows in the morning... In Aberdeen, in late winter/early spring... The air needs to be warm to carry the moisture out, and I had a thermometer in my room that showed the temperature was no more than 16C at the most.\nThe kitchen was not great either. the microwave was rusty inside, and one of our oven doors fell off and we had to ask them a good couple of times to replace it. Our hot water also sporadically turned off every once in a while, which is just the nail in the coffin when you're living in a freezing room that is literally like a coffin.\nIn general, I would avoid Every Student properties. I had issues at the Old Fire Station as well, which included our flat flooding, the firemen being called, and being shouted at by a maintenance guy when I was expressing my concern about him turning the power back on and that if I stepped in the water I might get fried alive.\nSo yeah... Don't stay here, and avoid Every Student if you can. And if you've already signed a contract and can't get out of it, equip yourself with a dehumidifier and a ton of mould and mildew remover, the Astonish stuff is pretty good.",

Also you can't drink the water from taps in the ensuite bathrooms.\nTo top it all off, the cold in the bedroom also causes black mould to grow. I had black mould growing around my window, something that seemed to be a problem in almost every room in our flat, to horrific levels in some (see photos). After returning from Christmas break, I discovered to my absolute horror that there was black mould growing on the underside of my mattress (see photos). This is a serious health hazard, but despite this I had to ask staff THREE separate times to replace my mattress. The last time I was in tears, I called them around midnight. I think they expected me to sleep on a mouldy mattress. Later they told me to open my windows in the morning... In Aberdeen, in late winter/early spring... The air needs to be warm to carry the moisture out, and I had a thermometer in my room that showed the temperature was no more than 16C at the most.\nThe kitchen was not great either. the microwave was rusty inside, and one of our oven doors fell off and we had to ask them a good couple of times to replace it. Our hot water also sporadically turned off every once in a while, which is just the nail in the coffin when you're living in a freezing room that is literally like a coffin.\nIn general, I would avoid Every Student properties. I had issues at the Old Fire Station as well, which included our flat flooding, the firemen being called, and being shouted at by a maintenance guy when I was expressing my concern about him turning the power back on and that if I stepped in the water I might get fried alive.\nSo yeah... Don't stay here, and avoid Every Student if you can. And if you've already signed a contract and can't get out of it, equip yourself with a dehumidifier and a ton of mould and mildew remover, the Astonish stuff is pretty good.",

I've been living here since September 2023, and we have had major issues.\nWe would only get a few minutes of hot water in the shower before it went freezing. It took them until February 2024 to fix it after months of us complaining about it. This is not the receptionist staffs fault. They were lovely and sympathetic, the issue lies with the broader company. They clearly don't care about their residents.\nThere is mold all over the curtains and windows, and my bedding is constantly damp and has a bad odour from being near the window, no matter how often I wash the pillowcases that sit near the window. The room doesn't heat up at all. The heaters switched off once the room reached 18°C, then they increased it slightly after months of complaints from us. Even still, it was too cold, so we all invested in heaters for our rooms (which were not prohibited upon purchase). They recently sent an updated house rules email stating that heaters were banned, and a few days later, whilst coming into our rooms to \"check fire doors and clean shower heads\" they snooped around our rooms and found our heaters, and took them away. This was 5 days ago and there has been no email explaining why they were taken and how we are meant to get them back. We didn't even have a chance to take them home when they told us they were banned, they just took our personal property from our private rooms.\nI have asthma, and this is a huge concern because the heater was helping the mould and dampness stay away, but now I will likely wake up with asthma attacks in the night due to the mould and cold air with minimal heating. I am beyond frustrated and angry.\nThe heater installed in the room is situated by the door, nowhere near the bed and desk where it is much colder. The window is poorly sealed and cold air and wind comes through right next to the bed and desk. The installed heaters also switch off after about 5 minutes of use, so we need to constantly get up and turn it on throughout the day.\n\nDo not stay here, this is a terrible excuse for accomodation, and me and my flatmates deserve compensation. We were paying for hot water and heating and simply not getting it for months.",

If you love to take cold showers then this the place for you cause you literally can’t have a hot one. The rooms look like you are stuck in the 60s but don’t worry if you are ever lonely you have some lovely little friends to keep you company - woodlice. I also love the amazing view of  the ads stuck in our windows, making our rooms look darker than we thought possible. Looking for some fresh air, just stand by the closed window and you will feel an incredible breeze thanks to the gorgeous single glazing. On a serious note I would quite literally rather live in prison at least I would get hot water there. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!",

Beautiful area and our neighbours were a field of cows with their calves, all very quiet too!  The campsite is basic but lovely, a small site but has everything you need.  The shower and toilets are spotlessly clean. Libby the owner,  is super friendly and can give lots of local recommendations, even down to pre-laminated local walks that you can take & bring back for fellow campers to use. She also has a friendly cat, Quinten. Libby bakes fresh bread with different flavours that you can order the day before and it’s even hand delivered to your tent, still warm.  Excellent location to visit Haddo House, Pitmedden Gardens, Tolqhoun Castle, Huntley Castle and Fyvie Castle, plus lots more! Highly recommend if you like a quiet, small campsite.",

Their is a small clubhouse at reception where we played pool which was a nice change and indulged in some ice cream. The walks by the river were lovely and an array of birdies to hear. The site is very well maintained and whilst some pitches are still getting tidied up the ones that are finished are pristine. Also one of the things I liked was its a flat rate, no additional charges for extra child or adult. Might I add although its very close to the dual carriageway you are not impeded by the noise. Win win for me 😊🫶",

Half of the pools were either closed or “booked,” so we couldn’t even use them. All that was available were the toddler pool, the slides, and the wave pool.\n\nThe water was freezing — it really didn’t feel like the heating was on at all. The showers were just as bad but in the opposite way: the water was boiling hot and impossible to regulate.\n\nTo make things worse, after spending four hours there, a supervisor told my husband that we were being “disrespectful” for giving each other a few small kisses. It wasn’t anything inappropriate — just normal affection between a married couple. Meanwhile, kids were splashing everyone and even throwing balls at people, and no one seemed to care about that.\n\nOverall, the experience was terrible. Poor management, uncomfortable facilities, and rude staff. We won’t be coming back.",

Little kids pool was great and shallow for little ones and the other part of the pool with the lazy river was good. The siren for the wave machine going on, seemed a bit too much and scared my daughter when it went off. I get why they need it and for the older kids its great but I don't fully understand why it need to be soo loud, specially when the kids pool is right next to it and the end of the flumes is there too. Just a short siren niose with a warning would surely be enough to let people know the wave machine is about to be turned on.\nThe fumes were great and my nephew had a blast on the, although there was no lifeguard or sign at the bottom of the stairs telling people that they can't wear their glasses on the fume nor have them in there pocket, my friend went all the way up the stairs and then was told he can't wear his glasses and had to leave them at the top, so he had to go down the fume then walk up all the stairs to get his glasses to walk all the way back down the stairs again.\nIt is a great pool for family's to go too and kids to play and have fun. The diving pool looked good and the lanes that they had out away for the kids and play pool is good from what my parents said.\nThe changing village was a bit confusing for a first time goer, as told when we first went in that we had to get change in our colour code area but then when we got out and were looking for a family cubicle in our colour code area but there wasn't one, I asked if we were allowed to go to a different colour area  to get changed as there was a free family cubicle and was told that you allow to get changed wherever you like, you just have to use the the lockers in the colour youve been given.  So that was a bit confusing that two different people as telling people to different things.\nWe would go back but probably not until my daughter is a bit older and can fully enjoy everything this pool has to offer.",

They did ask if they could wait inside but were told no. Even though there is a table and chairs plus vending machines. I picked them back up and returned in 25mins. Yet again Brenda refused them again. This time for being out of luck!  Other people had arrived and were allowed entry even though we were told to wait 30mins. Thinking this was a bit unfair, I went inside with the girls to see why this had happened. Only to be told its just luck. Then another lady arrived to say it was busy, I said but surely they can wait as the pool doesnt close for another 2hrs. She then said there was plenty of other pools we could go to. How rude, not very good customer service, to be told go to another pool miles away, when still another 2 hrs of sessions left. I explained we had travelled here waited half hr so wanted to stay here. I asked what did the girls need to do, to be in with said 'luck'. Should they wait right outside the door as again asked if could stay inside but was advised no not an option. Stood outside, then a lady arrived with her child, walked in and was told would have to wait as busy, heard the lady say that's OK we will wait here INSIDE, was not told to leave Clearly an issue with children as the adult was not advised to wait outside. Then if things couldn't get worse, Brenda then proceeds to let the lady and her son gain entry before the girls, who had waited patiently outside the door.\nAfter seeing this,  I went back inside with the girls to see why this had happened as no one had came out the building. At this point we were allowed in. All very strange and not good customer service.\nClearly had an issue as the lady who told us to go to another pool spoke to the lifeguard and started pointing at the girls. Then the girls were accused of not being able to swim, when all have completed swimming lessons years ago. Honestly couldn't believe how this afternoon turned out. Will definitely not be back , if this is the way they treat children, who are in fact paying customers.",

The gym has massively gone downhill since we joined. There are so many issues that it feels like staff and management just don't care - the latest example is the price hike they are implementing. We have made attempts to contact someone about cancelling our membership be it on the phone, via emails, on the Live chat, and speaking to Susie the deputy manager in person. We haven't had any communication from anyone - Membership team or management. The biggest issue this past year was the broken air con through the summer. The fans used in the interim were not enough, and some members would move them so they would get all the cool air. The gym is a mess on opening in the morning - weights all over the place and not put away from the night before. Again issues that were raised directly to the manager and nothing done about it. The landmine bar was missing for months, equipment goes broken for longer than acceptable before its replaced, there is no towel bin in the gym changing room so dirty towels are left in lockers and on chairs/benches (if patrons are too lazy to take them back up to reception), gym equipment has gaffer tape over it for temporary fixes. Then upstairs, it just continues so much so we stopped using some of the facilities - the swimming pool stinks of sewage, only 1 changing cubicle in the changing room so people have been forced to change in the toilets. Then there's the cafe - constantly waiting over 20 mins for just a coffee, that's after waiting a while to get served. The area can also be very overwhelming for people who are Neurodivergent with noise sensitivity at times, especially when there is a promotion of DL Kids programme, new classes, products, charity stall etc, even worse when there is loud music playing by the seating area which isn't often but the events aren't thought through properly to be inclusive for all members.\nIf you are a part of any other membership schemes ie Costa, you get a discount or freebie for your birthday - and they don't charge for membership. At DL, you go through the embarrassment of not being able to go through the barrier until the reception wishes you a happy birthday. That's it. As nice as it is, a free drink, cafe discount or something similar would be even more appreciated - especially when we pay £181 per month!\nSo, from now we are cancelling our direct debit, I'd rather get all of the same for £25 a month because then I would be getting what I pay for. It's obvious the management do not care about the clients, even us with Platinum membership.\nSave your money and go elsewhere.",

The gym has massively gone downhill since we joined. There are so many issues that it feels like staff and management just don't care - the latest example is the price hike they are implementing. We have made attempts to contact someone about cancelling our membership be it on the phone, via emails, on the Live chat, and speaking to Susie the deputy manager in person. We haven't had any communication from anyone - Membership team or management. The biggest issue this past year was the broken air con through the summer.

(Cat who was on reception when we first checked in deserves a special mention). The room was very clean and adequately spacious. TV, hair dryer,tea and coffee all supplied. The bathroom was small but had a good walk in shower with constant supply of hot water. The bed was very comfortable and afforded a good night’s rest. Our views out and over the city were good. The lounge bar is a very pleasant place to pass an hour or so with its funky decor and nice views out the large picture windows. Our rates were very favourable for such a nice stay. Would recommend if visiting Dundee. Very handy for the trains and buses. There is a Tesco outlet directly below the hotel which came in handy. I didn’t avail of a breakfast and as there is no restaurant on site I can’t comment on this aspect. All in all good value for money stay.",

Any maintenance issues or problems you’re having get dealt with quickly and it’s easy to raise faults in the IQ app. Parker House holds regular little events in reception and the communal spaces which is an easy way to socialise (and also get little treats.)

The shower block and amenities were excellent and the Larick community cafe is next door.\n\nWe'd recommend this campsite to anyone looking for a peaceful and convenient base to explore the area.😊\n\nTracy and Simon",
