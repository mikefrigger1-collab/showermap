Poolside area for changing and showering is warm and working well.\nThe improved environment makes me feel more motivated to attend and enjoy the excellent classes even more.\nThe only downside is that the more popular classes are now so difficult to get a place on, even with the online booking system.",

Never seen such a filthy area. Absolutely disgusting. People wearing outdoor shoes all around the pool and other areas you would be barefoot. Cant shower before entering the pool so a lot of people bypassed and went straight to the pool, although the water didnt look dirty whilst we were in there who knows... My daughter really enjoyed her time there but I was just waiting to leave. As previous reviewer stated there is a refurbishment going on which has clearly presented issues when trying to keep the pools operational at the same time. I would only return if after the refurbishment there are plenty of positive reviews for cleanliness and facilities. Until then we will be sticking to kingswood and longwell green.",

In the past 2 months the slow lane has been narrowed to the point that people are getting hit when passing each other. I wrote to ask why these changes had happened, and to let them know that this was not safe. I have received emails where staff have blatantly lied about the consultation process - members were not consulted about these changes as part of the review. The swimming clubs take precedence. Speaking to anyone at all is like talking to the wall. This place has gone down hill as it is very poorly managed, staff are indifferent to members paying over £400  a year.

In the past 2 months the slow lane has been narrowed to the point that people are getting hit when passing each other. I wrote to ask why these changes had happened, and to let them know that this was not safe. I have received emails where staff have blatantly lied about the consultation process - members were not consulted about these changes as part of the review. The swimming clubs take precedence. Speaking to anyone at all is like talking to the wall. This place has gone down hill as it is very poorly managed, staff are indifferent to members paying over £400  a year. Do better for your members Hengrove.",

Working for a government-run organisation seems to have made them complacent—they don’t put much effort into teaching and just seem to take it easy. Whether it’s the fitness trainers or the swimming instructors, they tend to favour their friends or personal contacts and are very careless with everyone else, almost as if they’re running free trials or tests. They often avoid answering questions, which I’ve seen multiple times. The prices aren’t exactly cheap, so just because the location is convenient, they shouldn’t run the place so sloppily.",

Please take your children somewhere else if you think they will need any sort of support. My son is now saying he doesn’t like water. Lessons have done the opposite to what they should.

The atmosphere feels like a terrarium—dark, overly stuffy, and humid, with almost no natural light, at least in the areas I visited. They have a swimming pool (with a maximum depth of 1.40 m), a jacuzzi, and male and female changing rooms, which are communal spaces without individual cubicles, except for a section separated by a curtain that offers some privacy. There is also a changing room with a shower for people with disabilities. Additionally, there’s a fitness area that I didn’t visit, as my primary interest was the swimming pool. From the signs on the walls, I understood they also have a physio clinic and a beauty salon. They have a café located right next to the pool, where the smell of mold and the feeling of humidity are almost unbearable; again, there’s no natural light. The staff are friendly and polite but not very well-informed about the services offered. The building has a sufficiently large and free parking area, though it’s not well-marked, so parking is somewhat haphazard. Overall, I wouldn’t choose this place for sports activities.",

Which is ridiculous and means there are usually no dumbbells that you want left. I've seen arguments break out over this and it's made for an extra uncomfortable experience. Why would they do this?\n\nThey've done up the gym which imo looks really good. However, I've noticed a lot of issues since the refurbishment.\n\nFirst of all, they've not added any cleaning equipment. It's insane to me that this gym doesn't have anything to clean sweaty equipment with, I feel dirty every time I leave. The place feels quite grimy in general and I can't help but think being able to clean equipment would help massively.\n\nSecond, they now host classes in an area where all of the free weights, medicine balls, barbells and mats are. Which is totally fine, except when I tried to get some equipment for my workout (I stayed well out of the way of the class, which was on the other side of the area) I was rudely shouted at by the instructor, Andy, who embarrassed me in front of the entire class. He said I'd have to ask for each piece of equipment I needed. Which is ridiculous considering I'd have to interrupt the class every time I wanted a different weight. So basically, if you want to use free weights you have to check the schedule and it's tough shit if a class is on at the time you want to go.\n\nThe WiFi has also got noticeably worse since the refurb and barely works on the second floor.\n\nThe decision to put all lockers on the top floor is bizarre and annoying.\n\nAlso, I've never in my life been told off as much as I have in this gym. I think my schoolteachers were more lenient than the trainers here. I've been yelled at for having a jacket with me, a small bag, my posture being incorrect, and, as said previously, just trying to get equipment.\n\nIf it wasn't for all of those things it would be a great place to go and exercise:)",

The original assets of this gym were its spacious size and it’s unique way of being bright and cheerful.\n\nMost gyms are not blessed with natural lighting and are typically in basements or buildings which rely heavily on artificial lighting. This gym had a blessing and it made the most of natural lighting and large free-weight space.\n\nI’ve been since the refurbishment and I needed to terminate my contract. Something is not right and it’s hard to describe it but it’s moved away from it’s core assets which is why I use the analogy that it’s lost a lot of it’s heart.\n\nThe weights section used to be sparse and large. It worked really well. The second floor was brilliantly designed but simple and effective. It’s changed significantly and I may be in the minority but it’s just not the same. Sometimes marriages don’t last, it can be said, and on this occasion I’m relocating to a gym up the road which I don’t want to spell out here as it’s already too busy as it stands!\n\nI had great memories here though, and the rating can’t be one star because the staff are nice here. In terms of the Gym group it may be bureaucracy from above but replacing white walls with grey/black paint and the drastic change here was a big call!\n\nTo give feedback and I may be in the minority, I would agree with the aspect that knocking down the changing rooms was a good call. The third floor was definitely underused, but I would say the functional aspects could have been on the first floor.\n\nIn other words everything from the third floor (including new functional equipment) could have been paced on the first including classes. I feel the functional facilities could have been relocated to the first floor to better utilise the new available space and improve visibility, perhaps even serving as a form of advertisement for the classes offered.\n\nAlthough equipment needed replacing and a lick of paint was required this does look like an entirely different gym/brand now. That being said, this is only one bad review! I’m sure I’m in the minority and it’s all personal preference. Thank you for the memories here! And all the best!",

The location is great if you work centrally, the equipment is all new, the place is clean and the dark/purple vibe is nice.... the music 8/10 times seems to be some deep house or trance, which I think is perfect for working out.\n\nThe crowd: This is pretty good too. No big egos. If you go too late in the day you do get several gaggles of students that bunch up around one piece of equipment and most chat and look at their phones, which sucks the vibe out, but you get there everywhere and it isn't that prominent here.\n\nThe cons: (or at least, caveats)\n\nNo mirrors. Apparently it's too make people feel less threatened (by themselves??) That feels like a cop out, I'd guess it's cheaper than insurance, but there are zero mirrors on the gym floor... not one... not only are they a useful tool for checking your form, but you'll never been as big as when you're at the gym, and not being able to see it live feels like I'm being robbed of an opportunity to see myself at my biggest... sad times.\n\nDumbbells only go to 35kg, and plates for the benches are limited, which is a real restriction and explains why you won't find big lifters here.\n\nThe equipment is quite jammed in downstairs, so it's a bit of a pain stepping over things and people to move around when it's busy. Upstairs as much more space.\n\nThey sell shakes, but there no information available on the macros... I asked and they couldn't tell me how many grams of protein.. or even how many total calories ... what maniac is training hard and then drinking a mystery shake that could be 1000 calories? Not this one.\n\nThe soap in the washroom sinks is out 7/10 times.\n\nReception often ignore you, the customer service could be better, I think it's a training thing.\n\nOverall, easy worth the money.",

The location is great if you work centrally, the equipment is all new, the place is clean and the dark/purple vibe is nice.... the music 8/10 times seems to be some deep house or trance, which I think is perfect for working out.\n\nThe crowd: This is pretty good too. No big egos. If you go too late in the day you do get several gaggles of students that bunch up around one piece of equipment and most chat and look at their phones, which sucks the vibe out, but you get there everywhere and it isn't that prominent here.\n\nThe cons: (or at least, caveats)\n\nNo mirrors. Apparently it's too make people feel less threatened (by themselves??) That feels like a cop out, I'd guess it's cheaper than insurance, but there are zero mirrors on the gym floor... not one... not only are they a useful tool for checking your form, but you'll never been as big as when you're at the gym, and not being able to see it live feels like I'm being robbed of an opportunity to see myself at my biggest... sad times.\n\nDumbbells only go to 35kg, and plates for the benches are limited, which is a real restriction and explains why you won't find big lifters here.\n\nThe equipment is quite jammed in downstairs, so it's a bit of a pain stepping over things and people to move around when it's busy. Upstairs as much more space.\n\nThey sell shakes, but there no information available on the macros... I asked and they couldn't tell me how many grams of protein.. or even how many total calories ... what maniac is training hard and then drinking a mystery shake that could be 1000 calories? Not this one.\n\nThe soap in the washroom sinks is out 7/10 times.\n\nReception often ignore you, the customer service could be better, I think it's a training thing.\n\nOverall, easy worth the money.",

Overall it's a pretty good pool that feels safe and clean but there's a few things that make it kind of run down (somehow despite bits of kit being replaced recently?). When you put a padlock on a lot of the lockers it doesn't actually lock it and you can still open the door afterwards. The scan-in gate hasn't worked for months meaning you have to wait for a member of staff to appear (I've waited 5-10 minutes multiple times) to scan you in. I appreciate the booking system because it helps you see how busy a session might be but it's pretty pointless when you can't scan yourself in when you get there. Despite two new ones recently being installed, just one of the three hairdryers in the women's changing room just about works. The costume dryer has worked less than half the times I've visited in the last year, even the recently installed one. Given membership prices increase every year it would be nice to see things get fixed properly instead of replacing things cheaply and then them breaking quickly.",

We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

I loved the sauna and steam room followed by the cold water bucket, certainly felt refreshing.\nHot tub was really busy but I managed to squeeze in for five minutes.\nTowel hire is worth it for £3 because you can get a fresh towel as many times as you want, very useful.\nShower rooms were clean and had lovely shower gel and shampoo.\nWill definitely be back for one of the food and swim packages, especially when the weather gets warmer.",

I must say we were blown away by the whole experience more queens club than David Lloyd’s and with bells on . This lido was refurbished and reopened to the public in 2007 . Architecturally beautiful and lovingly restored with incredible attention to detail from the pool side cubicle changing curtains to the tasteful period furniture in the upper floors . The members and staff , friendly and charming shared their special place with us and we very much appreciated . Pool , steam , sauna and jacuzzi left us refreshed and ready for breakfast. Changing rooms and shower  areas were super clean and tidy . Then to breakfast well !!! This was another level and unexpected , ibérico chop with Catalan beans duck egg , morcilla and membrillo was a Hispanic combination I would have only expected to find in heaven , congratulations to the genius who pulled that baby to the pass at menu development . As in many cases sadly wonderful food not matched by service , would you like some toast with that or anything else we can get you would have been nice and a simple upsell , regardless come to expect these things and move on albeit annoying. Having said that the food quality setting and environment made for one of the most memorable breakfast. Thank you .",

But make no mistake, what appears to be an oasis is in fact a fortress. A selfish, smug little fortress.\n\nI arrived curious, hopeful even, eager to witness the lake I'd heard whispers about. A natural beauty, they said. A place to escape the heat, to swim, to breathe. And yet, as I approached the gates, I was not greeted with open arms or even polite disinterest. I was greeted with a sign. A sign so bold, so unapologetically elitist it may as well have read you are not welcome here.\n\nMembers only.\n\nThis is not a luxury hotel. This is not a spa. This is a body of water carved by nature, not privilege. And yet, Henleaze Lake guards it like it is a private vault handed down through aristocracy. The sense of exclusion here is palpable. The kind of pompous gatekeeping that makes your blood boil. The idea that something so simple and healing as swimming in a natural lake should be kept under lock and key for a few select residents with the right postcode or the right connections is nothing short of absurd.\n\nWhat are we protecting it from exactly? The working class? Teenagers? The very community it sits in? If a lake cannot be shared, what can?\n\nThis is not stewardship. This is hoarding.\n\nHenleaze Lake may pride itself on being pristine. On being untouched by the masses. But purity without access is not beauty. It is vanity. And if this place wants to be remembered as more than a snobbish relic clinging to exclusivity, then it must open its gates. Let the public in. Let the public splash. Let people swim without needing a golden ticket.\n\nUntil then, Henleaze Lake will remain what it is now, not a sanctuary, but a monument to exclusion. A lake drowning in its own self importance.",

This is a major event in the kickboxing community, parking really needs to be looked at for next year.\nCafe area was lovely, food and drinks little pricey especially when feeding the family.\nOverall sports centre nice and big. Needs to be more marshals ringside too, a lot of people were blocking views of people that had paid good money to watch their clubs and fighter's. Not enough control onto the matt areas.",

My only suggestion is bringing the showers closer to the area between the sauna and the pool. Otherwise so so great! Thank you team!",

The showers are in a terrible state: blocked with limescale and low water pressure, which makes them pretty much unusable.

The venue was nice, I was a little put off after looking at the reviews but as long as you know it’s a club not a spa then the price is a little more justified. The ladies who did our massages were perfect and very professional and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The massage rooms are near a gym so there is constant banging and cluttering. The pool and facilities were okay, again definitely not a spa experience though - when we arrived there was a class happening in the pool which luckily ended in time for after our massage, hopefully that was booked and planned  according to the spa booking. We booked with lunch as well, but we most definitely lost money by booking with lunch instead of paying there. It was an extra £25 we paid for lunch and we did not get that value, lunch wasn’t the best but the guy behind the counter was nice! 3/5 because the massage was really nice but would only come back for the massages, spa experiences are meant to be relaxing, we couldn’t even paddle around in the pool as it was all lane swimming and if you don’t move you’d get disapproving looks and tuts from club members. Just a bit disappointed because £115 is quite a lot of money for a mid experience :(",

I am a carer and literally wanted to come for a quiet swim once a week as a break from my demanding home situation. I joined solely to use the pool and the steam room. The pool is often booked for children swimming lessons, so a third of the pool is closed. In the mornings you usually have to dodge older men and women chatting walking or swimming two a breast, or its just simply over crowded. It feels like people soup. I have tried various times up to 6.30pm so far and found it always much the same except for the very rare occasions. Durring this time there seems to be an ongoing issue with hairdryers in the ladies changing room. Either none at all, a very small number, often the same sign from the management stating they will get more. Also the lockers are well past there best,  lots of broken doors, or locks that don't fully work. You can go through several to find a working locker. There are only 2 small changing cubicals, and the locks are broken.  The steam room has been out of order several times too.\n\nI have spoken to the duty manager a couple of times to highlight the issues of broken items and have been met with further empty promises, or just bring your own hairdryer (i do, it's not what i paid for). Resigned to the fact I'm stuck in this contract for another 8 months, as on enquiry am told that I can't end it early, even with the poor facilities.",

I am a carer and literally wanted to come for a quiet swim once a week as a break from my demanding home situation. I joined solely to use the pool and the steam room. The pool is often booked for children swimming lessons, so a third of the pool is closed. In the mornings you usually have to dodge older men and women chatting walking or swimming two a breast, or its just simply over crowded. It feels like people soup. I have tried various times up to 6.30pm so far and found it always much the same except for the very rare occasions. Durring this time there seems to be an ongoing issue with hairdryers in the ladies changing room. Either none at all, a very small number, often the same sign from the management stating they will get more. Also the lockers are well past there best,  lots of broken doors, or locks that don't fully work. You can go through several to find a working locker. There are only 2 small changing cubicals, and the locks are broken.  The steam room has been out of order several times too.\n\nI have spoken to the duty manager a couple of times to highlight the issues of broken items and have been met with further empty promises, or just bring your own hairdryer (i do, it's not what i paid for). Resigned to the fact I'm stuck in this contract for another 8 months, as on enquiry am told that I can't end it early, even with the poor facilities.",

A fantastic gym with great facilities, staff are super friendly and always up for a chat before or after a session. The sauna is a great added feature not to mention the addition of the squash court. The HPZ really takes the gym to another level and with it being recently refurbished its just incredible, really gives it that elite sports facility feeling. The gym has recently all been refurbished and it looks phenomenal, from the paint work to the new floor mats just a massive upgrade from the old version. The separation of each room is fantastic so you can pick and choose which room you would like to train in. They have recently moved the machines around in the machine room which has made it so much more spacious and a great environment to train in. Cant speak on the female changing rooms but the male ones are really spacious and clean, their hand soap always smells nice too which is a bonus. One of the best smith machines Ive used in a gym super smooth and makes using it an ease. Staff are always up to help with any questions you may have and very knowledgeable. Never taken a class there so cant really speak on that. Another massive bonus is the lockers to keep belongings, most gyms tend not to have these which is a brilliant feature which other gyms should adopt. The water fountain is also great provides ice cold water every time. Gym is regularly cleaned throughout the day keeping it in great condition all day. Regarding over crowding, it has only ever been over crowded once but that was in January / February when new year members join other than that never really had an issue with over crowding. Parking is great too you can park literally opposite the scenic Bristol County Ground and whilst on the topic of cricket you get free access to cricket matches during the cricket season which tops it all off for me as a massive cricket fan.\n\nOverall a definite 5 ⭐️‘s from me",

Mortifying for newcomers who want to keep their heads down and not stand out as a ‘gym newbie’. Some of the exercises in the class were also dangerous, I temporarily damaged my back from doing them, after following instruction from the PT. There is also no air con so the whole place gets extremely hot as soon as any heat hits the roof, I asked politely why there was no aircon to a member of staff, as I’ve never had this in a gym before, and he responded very sarcastically ’because it would cost us £35,000 a year’. I requested to quit after not attending for over a month and got slapped with an extra £35 charge which they have for whatever reason struggled to take from me and now requested I go in to make the payment.

          "reviewText": "Wow! Onroute Truckstops have been very busy at Swindon! What an amazing difference! My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.  Signage to parking was clear and concise, and there was ample space available.  Traffic flow was moderate and free.\n\nFirst engagement was the canteen, by which entry was via a newly developed entrance.  Stunning.  New groundwork’s was colourful and very pleasing to the eye.  There were new picnic tables positioned outside - and were being used.  New plants were positioned, giving the homely welcome.  A huge effort has been made to greet customers to this area and the transformation from the old side entrance is worlds apart.

Also in attendance were approximately 4 other staff and the whole food counter experience was top class.  A very nice touch was a bowl of free healthy fruit for visitors. Well done there.  Food service was very quick - top marks.\n\nThe canteen was spotless. There were plenty of customers throughout the day (I was there for a 24hr stop) and I watched with interest the positive energy this team had going on. Everyone was greeted with a welcome and a smile.  No name badges though, I’d like to have seen that - it’s a more personal presentation to thank someone and show appreciation by referring to them by name. It’s also awkward to have to ask, maybe this should be considered. On the opposite side of the coin it equally encourages staff to deliver excellence as it’s much easier to identify individual failings. Certainly not the case here today however.\n\nNo sooner had a diner finished a staff member was instantly on hand to clean and disinfect and prepare the space for the next customer.  There was also excellent promotion and encouragement by the staff to download and use the Onroute app.\n\nFeedback: drivers are still struggling to find the SNAP terminals to pay for parking and are constantly having to queue and ask at the counter, disrupting staff from the catering flow.  The terminals hidden away in the toilet corridor and are not signed. A staff member had put a handwritten sign on the access door to highlight the location but was told by management to take it down. This was a poor decision and negatively impacted good staff initiative.  It may not have been ideal or as professional as a custom branded sign, but it was better than nothing!  There is still no clear signage to the SNAP payment terminals and needs addressed for full score achievement.\n\nThe shop was well stocked and inviting. It’s bright and has most of the essentials needed for drivers. As soon as I approached the shop a member of staff was there to assist if needed. I made several purchases and the whole experience again was very good.\n\nThe toilet corridor from the canteen leads to access snap terminals, ladies, gents and disabled toilets, and showers.  It was clean, fresh, clear of debris; and both snap terminals were fully functional. All fire safety measures were present, in date and clearly identified.

My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.

But there was a separate shower room? Tell me which one would get more use? Proper family changing facilities or a shower room? Changed my daughter in the women’s toilets (is there a separate changing table in the men’s I wonder?) and it was set far too high. I’m 5ft 4 and the changing table was at chest height. Food options very limited  Tiny Burger King with no seating, the main seating are is very small and had food and rubbish all over the floor. Starbucks had my dad waiting 15 minutes for them to hand a cinnamon bun over to him (not heated up, why it took 15 minutes to give it to him I don’t know). There is a subway which seemed popular (no doubt because it was the only place you could a proper sandwich, the WHSmiths had a few sad looking, overpriced sandwiches. I ended up buying a small packet of crisps and two chocolate bars for £5.15. A woman next to me paid £4.50 for one pre packaged sandwich. Such a difference when compared to the southbound services over the road, where they have extensive seating, better food options and even a small farm shop selling cakes, coffee, flowers and local produce. Best avoid the northbound!",

The facilities were great: comfortable bedding, a spacious bathroom, a large desk, hangers, and efficient heating that kept the room warm. The bed was super comfy, and the towels were excellent quality — room was cleaned and we were even provided with fresh towels on the fourth day without asking.\n\nStaff are absolutely lovely and kind, room services presented every day asking if any tea/coffee top up needed or fresh linen or towels.\n\nCheck-in and check-out were quick and smooth. There’s also a scenic bar/café on the ground floor, and they even offer umbrellas for rent — a thoughtful touch for rainy days.\n\nThere were some minor constructive comments to share but nothing major\n\nOverall, a great stay and excellent value for money compared to similar hotels nearby.

The mattresses are thin and worn out. The double bed is actually two single beds pushed together and feels incredibly claustrophobic. The only room that is heated is the living/dining area, the wood burner is a lovely touch but due to no fan aspect, the heat is once again, lost upwards.

There are no towels provided, not even a tea towel or a hand towel.\n\nAs far as location goes, it's okay, it's near enough Bristol and a few amenities. It is not peaceful or relaxing as advertised though as it's very close to the M5 and there's a freight rail line that runs very close and all through the night.\n\nTo call this 'glamping' is an insult to camping.

          "reviewText": "The Wave is an amazing place and we are so happy it's back in business, the kids had an amazing time. The Camp was a good experience overall but still room for improvement. I was expecting the tent to be much cleaner considering the price per night. I'll list what we noticed:\n1) Bedding didn't appear to be clean as we saw hair from previous guest.\n2) Not enough wood for a booking of 3 nights, the tent gets very cold at night and if there's no sunlight in the day. So enough wood to keep the tent warm is a must.\n3) Not enough toilet roll for a family of 3 for three nights, though the tent toilet (porta-potty) is for night emergencies, it was actually used during the day as my autistic son didn't want to constantly walk to the shower area where there are proper toilets.\n4) Rubbish under beds, old socks from previous guest under bed, food wrappers, food crumbs, a lot of dust, spider webs and spiders living under the bed crawling up to the bed was upsetting. This shows a total lack of proper cleaning of our tent (tent 4) which was unfortunate to see. Of course the odd insect in the countryside is normal, it would be expected that spider webs would be cleared out for guests staying as best as possible.\n5) Sign said food up until 8:30pm, but didn't say that food is only served until 5pm on Tuesdays, this was not noted on the signage upon arrival, and went without dinner and ended up with two very  hungry kids. That needs updating as it's misleading to guests. Went in to buy snacks and was turned away.\n6) The surfing experience was amazing, but The Camp can make some major improvements as noted above, especially for the price that they are asking per night.\n7) Staff at the camp generally very helpful, especially the girl with the northern accent, unfortunately didn't catch her name.\n\nHope this is helpful for The Camp to see and make improvements for future guests. Thanks for the experience.",

          "reviewText": "We recently spent four days surfing at The Wave in Bristol and stayed two nights at The Camp. Overall, we had a great time surfing — the wave pool is absolutely brilliant, with perfect waves for all levels and friendly, helpful instructors. However, our experience with the accommodation was quite disappointing.\n\nFive days before our arrival, our booking for the first night was suddenly cancelled, even though we had made the reservation three to four weeks earlier. We were told it was due to a booking error with Booking.com, but it was frustrating to receive such short notice and to have to rearrange everything so close to our trip. As a suggestion, better communication between The Wave and Booking.com would help prevent this kind of issue — cancellations shouldn’t happen only five days before arrival when the booking has been confirmed for weeks.\n\nWe were also not offered any help to store our surfboards during the cancelled night, which meant we had to carry them unnecessarily.\n\nWhen we finally checked in, there was no firewood left for the evening, and no one came to bring any before leaving for the night. The tents don’t have any heating apart from the wood burner, which only warms up the kitchen and living area — the bedrooms stay quite cold.\n\nThe tent hadn’t been properly cleaned either — there were food scraps and bits of plastic on the floor around the kitchen and living area. There was also no toilet paper in the small private toilet (which is meant for emergencies at night — during the day you’re expected to use the shared shower block).\n\nThe shared showers are actually very good — clean, with adjustable hot water, which is much appreciated when it’s cold.\n\nAs for comfort, the mattresses are quite worn out and sink a lot; you can feel the springs. The Velcro fastenings on the bedroom windows don’t close properly, so cold air comes in during the night. The kitchen lacks a proper coffee maker (only instant coffee provided), one of the pans had been stored dirty, and the cookware is of poor quality — food sticks easily. Everything else was fine.\n\nIn summary, The Wave itself is an incredible experience — the wave pool and the staff (the “Wavemakers”) are outstanding and made the surf sessions really enjoyable. However, The Camp needs much better maintenance, cleaning, and communication with guests. We hope these issues can be improved, because the place has great potential.",

But trust me from the day I decided this place till the end Debbie and Steve was so helpful. Let me talk about the place I reached the place without any trouble. If you are coming via Bypass A38 just keep in mind the nearest landmark is Holiday Inn Hotel, the farm is just 10mtr ahead oppst side of the road and if you are coming from Bristol Airport once you cross the Cowslip Grn you have to slowdown due  to low visibility, it’s immediate sharp downward . The Campsite had all the facilities as mentioned in their website, incase if you need anything extra just give a call to Debbie she will arrange in no time. They really built everything keeping guest in mind multiple toilets with shower facilities. There is a freezer and refrigerator to keep your food and drinks. The campsite is fully secured no outsider allowed. Just ensure you are carrying enough food and grocery you won’t find any store nearby, you have to travel all the way to Bristol which is not really far though (approx 6.7mls). The farm is surrounded by lot of places to walk and jog around. And if you have kids I suggest should visit Wookey Hole in Somerset. It’s a nice smaller campsite, good facilities, brilliant service from the site owner, would stay again!\nCheck on their website they have music fest coming up.",

Great little park for the kids and lush orchard walks. Fire pit hire was great little touch. Only downside is the noise from the road, kept me awake as I'm not used to it.",

The little tractor that they move the caravans to the pitches with is a brilliant idea. You can take your car to your pitch should you need to unload and then move it to a car park which is just a short walk from most pitches. The shower and toilet facilities are excellent and kept very clean. This is our second visit and we love it. The area is delightful with much to explore. Peaceful and lovely. Thank you, we will be back.",

It did feel more like a festival than a campsite which made noise levels a little unsociable. If you are prepared for this then it's not an issue.  Due to the large number of visitors they could definitely have done with more showers and washing up facilities.  The water also needed to be warmer than 40 degrees for washing up. Everything was clean though.\nObviously, there is plenty to do here as it is part of the larger activity centre. There is also a lovely walk nearby.\nI would highly recommend bringing screw rock pegs as even standard rock pegs weren't strong enough to secure tents to the ground.",

We aren’t ‘campers’ but this Glamping pod was wonderful. We forgot to bring tea bags, but nipped to the Tesco nearby on the Friday night, and also didn’t bring enough towels but this was sorted by Debbie and we collected what we needed that night too! Pizzas were great!l too! All in all it was a fantastic weekend away - we only live in Bristol so it was about 45-50 min drive but felt like we were a million miles away!

Place was empty with no one to greet or help you. I tried to call the number for help but it went to voicemail and no one returned my call. The shower holder was broken, meaning for an awkward shower. Upon arrival, the shower block smelled strongly of damp from not being aired out properly. The room was fine but not great. The TV remote was out of battery. There were clumps of dust meaning I was sneezing and had itchy eyes from the allergies. At the time of booking, I asked a question about how to keep the room cool at night (because I can't sleep if it's too hot) and was told there was a heater in the room if I got cold ...? That didnt answer my question ...? Turns out the place is deathly freezing cold so that's good! I asked about using lockers the next day after check out, but had to follow up with this query that morning, and was told that I could only use them for 2 hours, which isn't very helpful for a whole day of exploring a city. I think I left my phone charger in the room so I enquired but never heard back. Turns out other people were staying there, but they didn't shut the front door properly after their night out. They also left the next door open so my section was really cold in the morning. Not worth the money, much better staying in a hotel for the same money but better facilities and customer service.",

Very reasonable good facilities toilet and a nice hot shower. I even messaged at around 9pm at night as (user error) I couldn’t get the shower to work and they came to look which I thought was amazing considering it was nighttime. There are lovely animals that roam the site (chickens and I believe to be turkeys!) which is really fun. Will definitely stay again when I’m in Bristol next year.

We rented for 3 nights in summer, 3 adults, 5 kids (3-7 years). The tenting location has no direct car access, but there’s a small parking area in site around 200m away, where you’ll leave the car and drop stuff (if tenting), they do have caravan and tourer areas separately. There are a couple of pubs within a decent walking distance of 45mins perhaps leisurely. Otherwise, there are superstores, pubs, small local shops a short 5-10 min drive away. This site is close-ish to the motorway, so if it’s real quiet you may hear a background buzz but we didn’t notice it. Finally, fair to mention that there is an electricity pylon on the car park area, where a clear buzzing can be heard when near, and when local usage is high (Sat nights) the buzz is more intense - this wasn’t a problem, and barely noticed (only when passing or intense Fri & sat night buzz in dead if night). If you’ll be having a few beers and you’re not alone, you won’t notice a thing. Very friendly and accommodating owners who past by and said hello. Excellent warm shower facilities, fires and BBQs welcomed! Great for kids",

Very responsive and helpfull, all to just make sure we were accommodated prior to and during our stay.\nWe also loved Alannia Costa Blanca. Very well equiped camp site, with loads of things to do on site and off site. Wonderful swimming pool, great spa, and very useful supermarket for fresh bread and the things you might have forgotten to buy end need at the minute.\nGood and relatively safe biking or hiking opportunities around the site.\nLong story short, we have already booked again for next year, and we can really recommend Euroresorts and Alannia Costa Blanca.",

Only downside being there's no water dispenser in there now, so take your own refreshments! And they could be more punctual starting the induction video on time for each session. Twice now we've booked for a set time, but dont actually get into the trampoline park until nearly 12-15 minutes into our hour session because of waiting for staff to come up and play the 3 minute safety video. Also it's never emphasised by staff to the mostly young visitors to actually watch and listen to it given its a safety video.\n\nThe swimming pool is really nice, one large slide, a smaller one for 4-8 year olds and a tiny one for toddlers. Lots of features in the leisure pool for kids too like fountains etc and plenty of lifeguards on hand who are also very helpful (given free changijg room tokens as one of the machines were working and arrived in reception at exactly at booked time so they gave us extra time to ensure we got our full hour actually in the pool! Changing facilities are clean, pools warm and sessions arent overcrowded either.  Really nice place to go!\n\nBowling alley isnt great. Narrow Isles which dont seem to be entirely level, need better maintenence and the food served isnt great.\n\nOverall a really nice place to visit with great staff, also has a soft play and now a 'putting range' too.\n\nJust check before going that there isnt a Bath Rugby match on when youre due to visit as you'll get stuck in traffic backed up to Widcombe with fans attending, and you won't get a parking space!",

Also it's never emphasised by staff to the mostly young visitors to actually watch and listen to it given its a safety video.\n\nThe swimming pool is really nice, one large slide, a smaller one for 4-8 year olds and a tiny one for toddlers. Lots of features in the leisure pool for kids too like fountains etc and plenty of lifeguards on hand who are also very helpful (given free changijg room tokens as one of the machines were working and arrived in reception at exactly at booked time so they gave us extra time to ensure we got our full hour actually in the pool! Changing facilities are clean, pools warm and sessions arent overcrowded either.  Really nice place to go!\n\nBowling alley isnt great. Narrow Isles which dont seem to be entirely level, need better maintenence and the food served isnt great.\n\nOverall a really nice place to visit with great staff, also has a soft play and now a 'putting range' too.\n\nJust check before going that there isnt a Bath Rugby match on when youre due to visit as you'll get stuck in traffic backed up to Widcombe with fans attending, and you won't get a parking space!",

My recent visit with my two children for a swimming session highlighted what I feel are excessive costs. The total expenditure for a single hour of pool use was significant, with a combined entry fee of £19.65, a parking fee of £3.50, and an additional charge for locker use.\n\nAs a facility operated by what I understand to be a charitable trust, I find these costs to be unexpectedly high and a significant barrier to entry for many in the community. Such a pricing model makes it difficult for lower-income families to access a valuable recreational activity, which seems to run counter to the purpose of a charitable organization. I believe it is important to reconsider these charges to ensure the center is truly accessible to all.",

She was terrified of the water until she started with Lotte and Charlene - particularly due to her poor vision. They were so wonderful with her and created the most beautiful relationship with her. She can now swim 10m confidently and that is all down to their incredible and friendly teaching. We have moved away to London and one of the biggest sadnesses of moving away has been leaving her swimming lessons. On a visit back to family in Midsomer Norton we made sure to go swimming and visit Lotte! Thank you thank you thank you.",

Changing rooms are too small. Could do with more machines such as a seated cable row machine, a standing calf press, and another smith machine (ideally with a thinner bar). Has a few too many treadmills as there’s only ever max. 5/6 people using them but usually less. Special mention to Adam Sellick who’s one of the staff/PTs there who has been there since day one and is fantastic. More so than any other staff member I see him spotting people with their lifts, dusting and cleaning, and reracking weights as well as rearranging dumbbells to make sure they’re in their designated place. Always got a welcoming, smiling face or is ready to lend a helping hand. The gym would NOT be the same without him.

          "reviewText": "Been going to this gym since the day it opened and it does the job for sure. It’s not a massive gym but it doesn’t get particularly busy compared to other gyms. Changing rooms are too small. Could do with more machines such as a seated cable row machine, a standing calf press, and another smith machine (ideally with a thinner bar). Has a few too many treadmills as there’s only ever max. 5/6 people using them but usually less. Special mention to Adam Sellick who’s one of the staff/PTs there who has been there since day one and is fantastic. More so than any other staff member I see him spotting people with their lifts, dusting and cleaning, and reracking weights as well as rearranging dumbbells to make sure they’re in their designated place. Always got a welcoming, smiling face or is ready to lend a helping hand. The gym would NOT be the same without him. You can see he takes his job seriously and keeps himself in peak physical condition, further showing his dedication.",

Both in terms of cleanliness and fittings/facilities, they're worse than the toilets you might expect at a secondary school gym (and not a private one, at that!). Yes, there are a lot of careless people who make it worse for everybody, but ultimately the same brown patches have been in the same places for months, and one tap has been broken forever.

I've been swimming at Cleveland Pools once or twice a week since soon after it reopened this year and count myself lucky to have such a gem nearby. The staff are lovely and helpful, the pool itself (the main pool - the smaller children's pool is closed for the winter) is always clean and a delight to swim in. There are well-maintained toilets and 12 changing cubicles (each big enough for a family in the summer) around the pool, and the room that used to be the ladies' pool is well worth a look to see the display boards about the pool's history. There are hot and cold showers poolside and of course always a lifeguard on hand. Weekday sessions in the winter are very calm (usually a handful of people per session) but hopefully enough to justify keeping the pool open in future winters! Saturday morning sessions seem to see 20+ swimmers each (the limit is currently 40 per session). I imagine it will be far busier in the summer.\n\nThe heat pump is due to kick in some time around April, although as it is drawing heat from the river, it's not expected to make the pool spa-level hot (approx. 28 °C is the current expected maximum, I believe). In the winters the pool is unheated and predicted to get below 5 °C in the coldest months. Currently, in early December, the water temperature is about 8 °C. I've seen fellow swimmers in anything from full wetsuits to standard swimming costumes, and staff are always happy to advise on and chat about kit (hats, neoprene gloves and socks, etc.) if needed.\n\nParking can be tricky (there is none available onsite, with the exception of two disabled bays for Blue Badge holders) and there is not much public transport nearby. Sometimes you find some free on street parking or paid parking a little way away, but count on at least a 10 minute walk. If all else fails, the nearby Morrisons offers 3 hours' free parking, but it is a 20 minute walk. Walking from the train or bus station takes around half an hour.\n\nAll in all, Cleveland Pools is a real pearl and I hope it becomes at least a bit better known and manages to stay open year-round for many more years to come!",

A grand piece of metal work signage naming the pool marks the entrance. You then descend down a pathway to the riverside pool complex - which starts with panoramic views across the site. The pathway to the pool has beautifully presented information boards exploring the history of the lido. The main buildings and entrance are crafted in gleaming golden Bath sand stone - which takes the visitor back in time to a bygone era. The work has been done sympathetically and is not overly polished. It’s under Fusion management and the staff are very  helpful and friendly and clearly and rightfully proud of the place. The online booking was a little tricky and places well oversubscribed, so I had to use a few tricks to get in 😉. The quality of the restoration is excellent and the attention to detail and craftsmanship superb. The lido is flanked by 12 spacious stone changing rooms - each individually numbered with original lettering and inside each door is a storyboard of an historic figure that frequented the lido or was associated with it. The pool itself is unheated and was about 19 when I swam. The pool is about 20 or so meters - so good for proper lengths and has 3 lanes with an additional wider lane taking in the arch of the pool. A heat pump is being installed which once complete will warm the pool all year around to about 28! There are grassy areas, seating areas, spacious and clean modern toilets, a communal changing area and bag storage room, good showers, lockers, a small cafe and a good sized toddler pool. A pontoon is under construction on the riverside which will allow boats to dock and drop off swimmers who have journeyed by river. Overall this is one of the finest lidos in the world and is unrivalled in terms of structure and history. Highly recommended - but book via App well well in advance to your planned visit. — at Cleveland Pools",

Highly recommended - but book via App well well in advance to your planned visit. — at Cleveland Pools",

The Wier is a well-known wild swimming spot so perfect for cold plunges during the session. Then the session itself is like no other sauna I’ve tried. The sauna “Gus” leads a guided meditation while wafting scented, super-heated throughout the space. All accompanied and enveloped by music from the sound system embedded behind the sauna walls. It’s wild, exhilarating, and relaxing all at the same time.",

Some people seem to not see the no entry signs  and cause issues on the road trying to back out.",

To my disbelief a man came out, I did ask him what he was doing in the only female shower when there were several male showers, he said a showers a shower & 'genders don't matter anymore'. This is disgusting, not only is there one shower for women, but its so easily accessible for anyone. Shower floods and the sink and toilet were an absolute state. Shower doesnt last long so you have to keep pressing it. I'm not going to lie it is probably one of the better showers ive been too however it's still not great. There is plenty of room to park & I like the variety of food outlets. However this experience is bad enough for me to complain about it. Around 1500hrs 17/7/25 I went to shower.",

          "reviewText": "I stayed in Green Park for my first year at uni of so I thought I'd write this to help out any future students who get put here and want to know what it's like. It was my last choice of accomodation by preference and I was disappointed that I was in the city at first, BUT it turned out to be a really good place to live.\n\nPros:\n- The LOCATION! It's so well situated for going into town, you have access to so many shops, pubs, clubs and literally all of the city centre is within walking distance. It is also right across the road from a nice park and more importantly a big Sainsbury's, which was so convenient.\n- Buses are a big deal at bath uni and living at green park is the best you can get. The bus stop is right at the front of the building, no walking needed. And the green park stop is the FIRST STOP on the U1 route, so you don't face the same issue that people getting on other stops have of not being able to get on because it's full. Bus times are still annoying but generally about every 15 -30 minutes.\n- The Flats have living room areas which are absolutely great for pres and socializing. comfy sofas and a big shared space.\n- 24/7 friendly security desk in the building (sorry useful for when you inevitably lock yourself out of your room). it's also fairly easy to report any maintenance issues this way\n- Don't have to leave the building to collect any post as all post for city accommodations get delivered here\n- 24/7 access to the common room which is extremely useful during exam season as it is a good study area.\n- The rooms are nice. Objectively much nicer than a lot of other accommodations. Most rooms have double beds and are ensuite with a proper shower rather than a wetroom.\n\nCons:\n- not being on campus does mean you have to buy the £399 bus pass which honestly sucks. You also have to wake up earlier to make it to lectures on time. The bus takes 15 mins on a quiet day and 30 minutes if it stops at every stop. This is definitely the biggest drawback.\n- The mattress is super hard. It took a while to get used to.\n- Annoying loud seagulls will keep you up all night\n- sometimes the area sinks of weed\n- The fire alarm is insanely annoying and goes off in the morning sometimes for like 5 seconds. it's a jumpscare every time.\n- some flats have issues with silverfish.\n- in summer some of the rooms get REALLY WARM",

          "reviewText": "I lived in Twerton mill over the 2024/25 year in a townhouse room which is the shared bathroom option. The townhouses comprise of seven rooms (the only room downstairs has an en-suite and is more expensive) you share two fridges and freezers between 7 people which at times can be difficult if everyone cooks lots, there are also two ovens. My biggest issue I had over the year was the tint on the kitchen windows, it made the kitchen feel really dark and it felt unnecessary due to us facing trees and the river. In the actual room you get all the basic amenities, I didn’t really have much of a problem with noise but I think that really depends where your room is. The bathroom was good, definitely better to go shared bathroom over en-suite as you only share with two others and instead of just a shower it was a bath and a shower. I swear from being in other flats within Twerton that the townhouse rooms are bigger as there isn’t a need to fit a bathroom in. The staff are very friendly at Twerton mill they are really lovely and it’s always the same faces which is nice. It feels like a nicer community of staff at Twerton rather than waterside and Charlton where you have to walk past a desk to get through to your flat it feels like there is much more trust and respect at Twerton for those that live there. The only thing I sort of feel lacks is the security, the security team were ok I defiantly felt safe on the premises however when it came to issues over immediate maintenance or parcels I felt at though it wasn’t quite up to scratch, I understand that the security can’t be expected to know a solution to every issue that is brought to them but it just never felt quite as good as when the day staff were there. Overall for the price I paid for my room I felt ok with Twerton as I made use of the gym and the events as well as the bike shelter however if I was in an en-suite room I don’t think I would have felt the same",

The kitchen also has enough space for everyone's things with 2 fridges and ample shelving. Staff are welcoming and helpful, always willing to lend a hand and help out if needed.\n\nMaintenance works quickly to fix any issues you report through the app/tell reception about. There's frequent events in the downstairs area that offer free food and drink; they often giveaway energy drinks and protein bars for free too. The downstairs communal area is great for socialising with plenty of space and a pool table. There's usually enough washing machines and tumble dryers for everyone to use, but sometimes you may have to wait until others are done to start your washing.\n\nOnly a 5 minute walk from a McDonald's and Lidl, which is great for convenience. If you study at Locksbrook campus it's also a 5 minute walk away, though Newton Park students will have to take the U5 into campus (luckily there's bus stops right outside the front entrance of Twerton for going in and out of campus/town).\n\nAll in all, a welcoming environment with lovely staff and great living spaces. Probably the only complaint I have is that my room's window faces another flat's kitchen, so they're able to see me through their window. Makes it a little awkward when they can just watch me through the window, but that doesn't detract from everything great about this place.\n\nI would definitely recommend Twerton Mill to first year Bath Spa students!",

The pitch was ok but quite close to the next pitch so privacy felt like it could be an issue. The toilet and shower blocks were heated and clean enough but the shower cubicles are far too small (I'm not particularly large and it was hard to bend down without touching all walls of the shower!). It's great that you can walk into Bath from the site but it's still a good 45 minute walk and a lot of that walk is quite industrial. I can also validate that like other reviews there is a lack of security around the site as there is open access from public paths. As a result of all of the above, we'd be unlikely to return.",

We will return and will recommend to others. I know it's all on the website anyway but we found the fridges and huge freezer really helpful for storing a few bits. Play facilities conveniently located in the middle of the campsite, good distance away from tents so not noisy but you can easily keep an eye on your kids. There's a washing machine there too and the woodfired pizzas that you can buy on Fridays and Saturdays were really good. We also recommend the pub the mill at rode, a few minutes away. Loads of great days out to be had, we enjoyed wookeyhole and trips to Frome, Wells and Shepton Mallet prison!",

One of the highlights was the stove-heated hot tub – bathing in the middle of the woods like that was pure magic.\n\nThe cabins, the yurt and the bell tents were all beautifully set up, with everything we needed and more. The communal areas with a kitchen and dining area were so well equipped – everything was top quality. I also really appreciated the focus on sustainability, which made the whole experience feel even more meaningful.\n\nAnd then there was the roundhouse – warm, wooden and a little bit tribal. It had such a special energy. Honestly, I could have stayed forever.",

There was a little traffic noise but we found that didn't disturb us at all. The fully serviced pitch was a good size with access to the services easy, though some would require a longer electric cable, though having stayed on other sites with fully serviced pitches we do have longer electric cable and water hoses for those that require them. The toilets and showers were always kept clean and well kept.\nWe will definitely be staying again when in the area.",

We also felt that the toilet block is looking tired and was not as clean (toilets don’t flush properly) and the showers aren’t great (push button). The pitch smelt quite badly of dog 💩. I did report this to the guy on reception but he didn’t seem at all interested.",

Lovely having fast food stalls in the evening. Games room closed to early at 6pm. So close to Longleat Safari Park it reduced alot of stress going back and forth. Good pitches with electricity with no issues. Terrible WiFi. Nice listening to the sealions next door! And a word to anyone who is planning to camp here who minds children playing....children are only children once. They are more limited these days where they can play freely so please be mindful of that if you want peace and quiet 24/7. You won't get that here. No one was unruly or noisy but there were some lovely children playing football and when their ball accidentally went near someone's campervan pitch they were screamed at to move away. Totally uncessary to scream and shout and children when they were already apologising. If children are bothering you on site complain to staff properly who will take action or find somewhere adult only. Thank you for a lovely stay. Only reason for not 10 stars is people kept walking through our pitch instead of around due to being next to facilities and next to a clue to treasure hunt and the WiFi issue and the games room closing early.",

Evening entertainment was great for the children.\n\nOnly thing I can say was that the swimming pool was quite cold especially for little ones so we didn’t stay in there for the whole hour but was a great swimming pool. It was our first time at a haven and would definitely be returning to a haven site at some point. It is really handy that the eating places offer a take away to the caravan as it rained on one of the days so meant we didn’t have to drag the children out in the rain.",

Yes, it is outdated and could do with a thorough upgrade, but there is no excuse for cleanliness and this applies to both the providers and the customers.

I had my 2 year old child with me and my autistic cousin. Even still, we got changed and left straight away. We were given dirty looks by people there. My autistic cousin was then swinging on the tree swing whilst waiting for a taxi. We then had a call from the owner KAREN who told us to remove him from the swing. We then had to leave the property and wait in a lane for a taxi.\nWould not recommend for people with children with disabilities. They're rude and do not accommodate for others needs.\nIt was then posted on social media that they cancelled swimming lessons because of the atate of the changing rooms and pool. However the pool was left in the same state we found it. Changing rooms were clear as we literally only got changed in them as we were not allowed time to shower.\nI then messaged Karen and asked to have a conversation about this, as I know it was left in the same state we found it in and if Karen could send evidence of this? Karen said it wasn't about us, blocked me from the page and ignored my messages.\nAbsolutely vile behaviour.\nSounds like Karen just sits watching the camera, which I don't feel comfortable with. I also know others would not feel comfortable with this either.\nKaren clearly has some issues around people with disabilities. I suggest Karen uses her money to get herself some counselling around this.\nWill not be going again.",

The gym itself has a good range of machines/equipment, and although it is not a large gym (compared to some other franchises) I find that it is never overcrowded. It is kept very clean and tidy both inside the gym and in the changing areas/shower facilities.\n\nThere is a very friendly atmosphere from the staff to the clientele, which (as someone joining a gym for the first time) I found incredibly welcoming and has kept me coming back multiple times a week. I would implore anyone signing up to opt for a membership that includes studio classes as there are options such as yoga (varying proficiencies), pilates, and more that are worth trying and offer value for money if you attend weekly. The 30 minute Small Group Training (SGTs) that run multiple times a day are an excellent gateway into general gym exercises: a quick shoutout to Ben, Poppy, and the rest of the team for making these a pleasure to do. Most members of the staff are qualified Personal Trainers, so if this is something you'd be interested in there is also the opportunity to hire them while still using the gym itself as a venue to train.\n\nFinally, I couldn't leave a review without mentioning the location itself; BLOCK Gym is in the middle of the Royal William Yard area, which is an upmarket suburb of the city filled with nice cafes/bars/restaurants and flats. Being a member of the gym will allow you to park here for free during your visit (remember to enter your car registration when you enter and every 60-90 mins or so thereafter) which also means you can treat yourself to a much deserved drink or bite to eat after a workout.\n\nI couldn't recommend more highly.",

While the staff are friendly and create a welcoming gym community, the cleanliness and maintenance standards are far below acceptable, especially for a university facility.\n\nDespite what older photos on Google Maps suggest, the gym today looks very different — worn out machines, dusty equipment, dirty mirrors, and stretching mats with stains that remain uncleaned for days. The cardio and cable machines often have dust, hair, and even nail clippings, and mirrors haven’t been cleaned in over 6 weeks. Some equipment is held together with black tape, which pulls hair and causes scratches during use.\n\nIt’s disappointing to see such a great space neglected. I’ve raised a formal complaint, and although I’ve received a polite response, many of the claims don’t match reality. I strongly suggest management visit the gym floor personally to see the actual conditions.\n\nUntil real changes are made, I cannot recommend this gym — especially not for those who value hygiene and safe equipment.",

The men’s showers have a strong, unpleasant odor of urine, which becomes very noticeable when pulling the curtains to step in. Several leg machines have torn seats that are crudely patched with masking tape — an uncomfortable and unsafe “fix” that can even pull at your skin or hair if you’re wearing shorts. A few other machines are unstable and make worrying noises during use, raising concerns about safety.\n\nThe lack of proper maintenance and cleanliness makes this facility a poor choice for anyone looking for a professional and well-kept environment.",

The shower facilities are okay and I appreciate the private cubicles. There’s only two for the female changing rooms but at least one has always been available for when I’ve needed it.\n\nThe equipment is outdated compared to many other gyms (e.g. buttons instead of touch screen) but still functional. It has mostly what you need but they are limited in space with everything in one room. I also wish they opened earlier, as 7:30am is quite late in my eyes… even half an hour would make a great difference.",

Plymouth is great for access with a huge free carpark and step free access. There is a nice sized cafe with the usual relaxed Hanger vibe where dogs are welcome and there are better bathroom facilities there than in Exeter with showers too which means you can truly hang out there all day! There’s a table tennis table and a gym and workout area plus a great shop for merch.  For climbing it is brilliant of course.. tons and tons of wall space with plenty of room to sit and study your course and hang with friends, loads of levels, loads of variety and lots of bouldering arches to boot.. Staff are friendly and helpful too.. it’s a special place and we love it.",

You then walk down a very short wood chip path to the sauna which has a cold shower and a cold plunge bath nearby. There were water cups just outside and orange slices at the end. The sauna has essential oils in the water too which is a nice touch. The session was 50 mins long, and we were given a 10 minute reminder before the end of the session. We were well looked after and blessed by sun on this occasion! The sauna was about 75 degrees Celsius when we were in there. The only constructive feedback I would give is just to mention the road name in the directions FAQ just for clarity, but the Google maps pin is actually accurate, so you can actually trust that, it’s just a bit of an odd road network!

They seem to keep equipment well maintained and the gents showers and changing room always seem clean and functional. This is a local, independent business that tends not to attract the \"posers\" so whatever your size and shape, you would probably feel welcome. Although I've never partaken in them, they offer various classes and one-to-one coaching which I understand to be very reasonably priced. Membership price is not dissimilar to other gyms in the area and it is possible to use the more extensive facilities at their Ivybridge site at certain times.",

I wasn’t in bad health, but I’m approaching 40, work in an office and as a father of two young kids my dad bod was beginning to get the better of me. I felt self conscious at the swimming pool and was buying a size larger in all my clothes.\n\nI reached out to Paul at BeUnique after seeing the boot camps run at Victoria Park. I said my goal was to take back control and get in better shape, but to do this in a way that had structure and would last and not just a quick fix that I couldn’t sustain.\n\nI’ve never been a member of a gym and so the thought of starting was dawnting.\n\nRight away Paul made me very comfortable. He worked with me to ensure that I was able to work around a busy life and we started working on building short and long term goals that felt achievable. The gym is full of a lovely bunch of people and I never felt out of place.\n\nFast forward 10 months and I am loving the gym and my sessions with Paul. I’ve lost weight, got in better shape and my mental health has improved dramatically as a result. I look good, feel good and have way more energy and enthusiasm.\n\nBeUnique is a great place to go for a first timer and someone that has been going to the gym their whole life. Paul and his team are all great and would highly recommend you pay a visit to see what you can get from it!",

It’s refreshing to find a service station that prioritizes hygiene so well. The staff here also deserve a mention; they are consistently friendly and welcoming, making each visit a pleasant experience.\n\nWhile it may not have as many food options as larger service stations, it still offers everything needed for a comfortable stop—good coffee, snacks, and a relaxed atmosphere.

It turned out to be one of the better service stations I’ve visited. The toilets were spotless, with plenty of cubicles available even during a busy afternoon, which made the stop quick and convenient.\n\nThere’s a good range of food options including Burger King, Subway, and KFC, along with a well-stocked WH Smith for snacks, magazines, and travel essentials. The EV charging area was easy to find and worked smoothly, though it’s worth checking availability ahead if you’re stopping at peak times.\n\nParking is free for the first two hours, which is perfect for a short rest or a quick meal. I also appreciated the step-free access and other accessibility features, which make the site welcoming for everyone. The green frontage and small water feature give it a relaxed, open feel—nice to unwind for a few minutes before getting back on the road.\n\nOverall, this service area is a clean, comfortable, and well-equipped stop for anyone driving along the M40. Whether you’re recharging your car or yourself, it’s a sound choice with everything you might need. Just plan a bit of extra time if you’re depending on EV chargers or particular restaurants during rush hours.",

The place is clean, bright, and even has a free piano you can tinkle on while taking a break. The food court offers something for every craving: KFC, Burger King, Subway, Chopstix, and the bright The Good Breakfast breakfast bar (step‑free access and all – ideal for stretching your legs)  . If you're in the mood for coffee, there’s both a Starbucks inside and a separate Drive‑Thru, plus a Taco Bell that opened in March 2025. And for a slightly more upscale sit‑down, there’s a PizzaExpress and a good-sized Waitrose & Partners for everything from grab‑and‑go sandwiches to snacks  . Between those options and WHSmith, Krispy Kreme, and the petrol forecourts, it really does feel like a small food village on the motorway.\n\nFrom my point of view, it’s one of the best service‑station experiences on the M40. You’ve got the classics—KFC, McWhopper‑style flame‑grill from Burger King, Subway subs—plus hot‑food diversity with Chopstix noodles and Taco Bell’s new menu. I particularly enjoyed the sit‑down at PizzaExpress; it felt like a proper break rather than just refuelling. The two hours free parking, clean baby‑change areas, EV chargers, showers, and a Ramada hotel on‑site make it practical for any kind of stop—whether it’s a quick food run or a short-freshen‑up break. I’ll definitely be adding this to my travel rota—I’d rather stop here than settle for a rushed snack at a less appealing service station.",

Tarmac is good and smooth and the traffic humps are normal. The most used part of the services are always the toilets and these are placed through the front entrance and down to ,the right. There is a Game Zone on the corner. Due to it being just below ground level the are both a few steps and a ramp for the less mobile of us. Toilets are fine with the weird Dyson hand driers stolen from scooter handlebars but they work great despite that. Coming out of the “Loo’s “ there is a Waitrose and then WH Smith’s on your right and then round to the left you have Subway and then Burger King. To finish the food and drink there is a Starbucks as you come in the Services entrance who have a sit in and an outside seating area for when it’s nice weather. Outside there is a washing machine pod where you can wash upto 20kg  (or so the sign says).\nThere are 24 Tesla superchargers then 4 Grid serve chargers by the walkway to the entrance and all round the outside left of the car park (with your back to the entrance) there are 24 charging points, but I’m not sure of the company who operates them,",

Anyone moaning about comfy beds should pay the extra £50 for the travel lodge up the road.\n\nJames behind the reception was a top bloke also, very welcoming. For the value of money, it’s excellent, will be staying again.",

I only figured this when another couple rocked up, having already waited half an hour and several pointless phonecalls to automated answering services. Getting access was similar to completing a task in an escape room.\nThe room, below ground level was musty and dare I say it stank of damp, two doors led off the room, one to an underground cellar which doubled as a ventilation room, the other was locked with access prohibited... The problem is that the one that was open was open to the outside, so the security conscious individual would probably be a bit put out at this.\nThe single bed ( incorrectly advertised as one twin bed)was rock hard consisting of two wooden blocks topped by a barely sprung mattress acquired from a skip which pinged on every turn.  Although the room was clean, it is advisable that the guest should not look too closely. Complementing the room a full size fridge was present and made full sized fridge noises, and as it was surplus to my requirements, turned off.\nDespite the offer of scratch cards for reduced parking charges (£10) these were not available nor was there anyone in reception as the reception didn't exist. So the guest can expect to pay the full whack of £16.70 for 24hours of parking.\nOne positive was found in the shower, clean and reasonable pressure, it was actually a pleasure to have a shower after the most uncomfortable nights sleep since sleeping on a deflated airbed.\nTo sum up, if you don't like people, have a strong back and not averse to a bit of damp, and have a bit of cash to spare this is your perfect getaway.\nPersonally I felt cheated, by both the owners and booking.com, having paid £144 for 2 nights.",

You cannot choose the pitch and you are told where to pitch and whether to go in forwards or backwards.\nUnfortunately however the toilet block lets the site down enormously as it is absolutely horrendous.   It is very tired, outdated and unclean.  The block has not been cleaned at all during the week we have been here. The toilets are old and unclean.  There are broken bits everywhere and un emptied  bins.  The showers are even more unpleasant.   They too small, dirty and in the women’s they have  plastic curtains which cling to your body as you try to wash (🙈).  There is a push button to get the shower started and then you have to keep pushing that button every 7 seconds to keep the shower running.  There is nowhere to hang your clothes and there is no bench.  Your clothes have to be wrapped up in a plastic bag or left outside so they don’t get wet but even outside of the shower there is nowhere to put that bag.  The whole block is disgusting.\nIn the laundry room is ok but again dated and there is no running hot water and two of the taps don’t even turn on.\nUnfortunately we will not be using this site again and the two couples I spoke to this week have both said the same and for the same reasons.\nIf you have a dog you are NOT allowed to toilet it inside the grounds…\nThe other Under 25’s and same sex groups of over 3 are not allowed to stay here???",

Just a field with a (very dirty) set of portaloo's (dirty when we arrived and not cleaned once in the week we stayed), a single outdoor shower that was muddy with stinging nettles underfoot (which we had to remove in order to shower) and no hook to hang your clothes. No bins and no washing up facilities. The service, whilst very friendly, was not what I'd expect at that price either... there was no gas for the shower and we waited 3 days (from the point at which we alerted the owners) for it to be replaced, so went 5 of the 7 days without being able to shower on site.\n\nI'm not writing this review to complain, but rather to inform others in our position. As I would not have booked this sort of campsite for our first camping trip with a toddler in tow, had I not (very wrongly) made a few assumptions based on the price, reviews and the professionalness of the website. We have stayed places like this (pre baby) and loved it, so pls don't let this put you off if it is appropriate to your needs. I hope this is useful.",

So happy and chatty.\n\nThe location is stunning. Private stream running through the woods and bluebells, sheep in the surrounding fields. No one else in sight.\n\nOur Dome (Haytor) was the dog friendly option and she loved the holiday as much as us. Double bed, bunk for kids and even doggy blankets. Beautiful rattan furniture and a log burner.\n\nOutside in our private space was the provate compost toilet which honestly had no smell whatsoever, private kitchenette, private shower room which had great water pressure. As well as our own log burner hot tub, hammock, fire pit and bbq with seating.\n\nWe had 1 day of sun and one of rain and on both we had a fab time, kids still enjoyed the hot tub even in the rain and loved running up the stream in there water shoes.\n\nI had mentioned it was my husbands birthday and they had left special birthday message and treat as well as bunting and balloons. Such lively little touches.\n\nAlthough there is no mains electricity they have solar lights a old USB attachment to the solar for emergency charging if needed but we loved the excuse to just turn everything off and relax.\n\nThen on our last day we were taken up to visit the Alpacca/horses and feed them.\n\nHonestly a wonderful family run set up. We had the best time and you were so welcoming. I have told everyone I speak to about our trip how much I reccomend going and hope that we get to come again ourselves.\n\nThank you for a perfect mini break.",

She spends a lot of her time building tents with blankets and chairs, it's very sweet.\n\nThe shower and toilet facilities were always clean and could be accessed at anytime during our stay.\nThere is a dish washing and chill out area with sofas, a large table and communal fridge/freezers.\nAt the check-in point there is an extensive list of items you can purchase should you need to.\nVarious food and drink venues to choose from, nearby beach and town which can be accessed by foot or the bus which stops right outside camp.\nStaff were friendly and extremely helpful, especially when we accidentally attempted to set up camp in a reserved spot. While me and my daughter went off exploring, a staff member helped my partner move our tent across to a vacant pitch.\nThe staff at an on site food truck kindly set out a blanket for my daughter under the light structure and lent her a bubble wand to play with which was one of her highlights of our trip.\nThe best part of Maker is definitely the place itself, wild camping without the wilderness.\nThere were so many bugs and beasties due to the wild nature of the place. We enjoyed watching the bees, caterpillars, birds and butterflies.\nMy favourite part of our first night was listening to all the crickets in the tall grass.\nThe view out onto the Plymouth sound and beyond is stunning!\nWe will definitely be back again very soon!",

          "reviewText": "I've spent many times at Maker over the last decade.\nMy latest 2 night stay was our 3 year old daughters first ever camping experience and we all had the most wonderful time!\nShe tells everyone how much she loves camping and is now constantly asking to go all the time. She spends a lot of her time building tents with blankets and chairs, it's very sweet.\n\nThe shower and toilet facilities were always clean and could be accessed at anytime during our stay.\nThere is a dish washing and chill out area with sofas, a large table and communal fridge/freezers.\nAt the check-in point there is an extensive list of items you can purchase should you need to.\nVarious food and drink venues to choose from, nearby beach and town which can be accessed by foot or the bus which stops right outside camp.\nStaff were friendly and extremely helpful, especially when we accidentally attempted to set up camp in a reserved spot. While me and my daughter went off exploring, a staff member helped my partner move our tent across to a vacant pitch.\nThe staff at an on site food truck kindly set out a blanket for my daughter under the light structure and lent her a bubble wand to play with which was one of her highlights of our trip.\nThe best part of Maker is definitely the place itself, wild camping without the wilderness.\nThere were so many bugs and beasties due to the wild nature of the place. We enjoyed watching the bees, caterpillars, birds and butterflies.\nMy favourite part of our first night was listening to all the crickets in the tall grass.\nThe view out onto the Plymouth sound and beyond is stunning!\nWe will definitely be back again very soon!",

However:\nWhen I first emailed a request for 'one room for one person for tonight' the receptionist responded with an email saying she didn't know what I wanted (?) Then apparently went home!\nWhen I arrived to enquire about a bedroom fir the night i got a very frosty response from the manageress who felt afronted that i'd walked in the open door asking for a room when they were infact closed. Her response was 'we're fully booked'. This of course was not at all true.  It turned out most bedrooms were actually unoccupied and available. She must have felt sorry for me or  something because she reluctantly asked me back inside and when she  'checked' to see if she could find room for me she actually found one ( or a dozen!)!!\nOnce i was allocated a room,  i was told it was £80 but when I said no way, it was discounted to £60, which I paid but later discovered the rooms were advertised for  £50.\nThe 1st room I was given had no working lights. The 2nd room I was given had a pretty strong amonia type smell, which I initially attributed to very strong washing powder. Given all the issues in getting the room I didn't complain but i was woken by the very strong smell in the night and tracked it to the smell of drainage coming up through the plug holes. Closing the bathroom door and peming the outside door for a while lessened the smell and allowed me back to sleep. The smell was really strong when the bathroom door was opened in the morning. Surely previous occupants must have reported this?\nThe internet write-up says breakfast is included in the roomrate - it is not, infact the cafe does not open at all in the mornings.\nWhat was good though was the bed, it was extremely comfortable. The tea and coffee supples were plentiful. The room was clean, warm (with thermostatically controlled heaters), of ample size with an open wardrobe/dressing area.

However:\nWhen I first emailed a request for 'one room for one person for tonight' the receptionist responded with an email saying she didn't know what I wanted (?) Then apparently went home!\nWhen I arrived to enquire about a bedroom fir the night i got a very frosty response from the manageress who felt afronted that i'd walked in the open door asking for a room when they were infact closed. Her response was 'we're fully booked'. This of course was not at all true.  It turned out most bedrooms were actually unoccupied and available. She must have felt sorry for me or  something because she reluctantly asked me back inside and when she  'checked' to see if she could find room for me she actually found one ( or a dozen!)!!\nOnce i was allocated a room,  i was told it was £80 but when I said no way, it was discounted to £60, which I paid but later discovered the rooms were advertised for  £50.\nThe 1st room I was given had no working lights. The 2nd room I was given had a pretty strong amonia type smell, which I initially attributed to very strong washing powder. Given all the issues in getting the room I didn't complain but i was woken by the very strong smell in the night and tracked it to the smell of drainage coming up through the plug holes. Closing the bathroom door and peming the outside door for a while lessened the smell and allowed me back to sleep. The smell was really strong when the bathroom door was opened in the morning. Surely previous occupants must have reported this?\nThe internet write-up says breakfast is included in the roomrate - it is not, infact the cafe does not open at all in the mornings.\nWhat was good though was the bed, it was extremely comfortable. The tea and coffee supples were plentiful. The room was clean, warm (with thermostatically controlled heaters), of ample size with an open wardrobe/dressing area. The shower was easy to use, open walk in type, with plenty of hot water, cleaning supplies and towels. Views from the bedrooms are amazing!  All other staff encountered were brilliant!",

Well, Stones and Stars has completely changed my mind. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Joe and his team to the moment we packed up to leave we loved it.\n\nImagine camping without all the rubbish bits that we all pretend to enjoy but secretly hate. Gone are the days off dirty kitchens, mouldy showers, and sleeping on an uncomfortable mattress wishing, not so secretly, that you had booked a hotel. Everything at the site is brand new and sparkly clean. The kitchens, showers and beautifully appointed tents are spotless.\n\nStones and stars have found the magic formula, distilling camping down to just the fun bits.\n\nYou know you are onto a winner when the kids are still asleep at 9am then eagerly run off to collect the firewood, play the longest game of hide and seek in Devon’s history (safe in the confines of the quarry) and then after a long day of outdoor fun even offer to wash up the bbq pans in the outdoor kitchen!\n\nThis is camping but not as you know it with comfy blankets, throws on the beds, great pillows all set in a idyllic location.\n\nThe kids loved it. From helping with the bbq to disappearing  for hours exploring the quite beautiful quarry. From campfire dinners to falling asleep to the sound of the local tawny owls reminding us we’re not in a five star hotel but sleeping under canvas. There have even been sightings of deer roaming the camp.\n\nSurrounded by beautiful walks, good pubs and amazing beaches but only 15 minutes from Plymouth train station stones and stars is a little slice of Devon heaven.\n\nIf, like me you would usually prefer a nice hotel but know the kids desperately want to go camping this is the place for you. A long weekend of fun, outdoor activities and no iPads. We will be back and if the kids are too busy I’ll happily come on my own and do some deer spotting.",

The remainder of the pitches slope gently down to the bottom.\n\nThe pitches are a good size with electric points. The main service point is on the service road close to the entrance and reception.\n\nWe visited to watch the fireworks festival in nearby Plymouth in August (2025). We saw the fireworks looking out over the bay and towards the golf course with the fireworks in the distance. On a clear night the view isn't too bad. There were quite a few people on the site doing the same.\n\nIt's about a 5 to 10 minute walk into the nearby village, which has a small shop and a village pub, which serves food and has a nice beer garden.\n\nThe site is well maintained, the grass nicely cut and kept to a short length. There's also a dog walking field, that's enclosed, with several paths cut through the long grass.  There are a number of pitches without electricity, offering an element of wild camping.\n\nThe services are quite limited and the price is, as with most CAMC sites, on the high side. As I write this review I'm sat in France, having visited several aires and campsites that have, almost without exception, all been significantly cheaper. In fact in Annecy in the French Alps I paid €125 for 4 nights with a lakeside location, shower blocks, toilets, small shop and bike hire; though generally campsites and aires are generally cheaper on the continent.\n\nLevel 10 Google reviewer with over 1,200 reviews with 2 million views plus 14,000 photos with more than 60 million views and still going strong 💪.\n\nMy reviews aren't sponsored, they're based on mine, and often my wife's experience at an establishment whether that be a shop, restaurant, service or activity, with the aim of highlighting great service plus areas for improvement, if necessary. And boy sometimes it is necessary.\n\nCheck out my other reviews 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",

There is a pool, plenty of things to keep little ones entertained & for the fur children there is a fully enclosed field, be aware that it has a steep slope at one end of it & if you have a fluffy dog be prepared to pick out all the leaves & brambles from their fur. On a plus note there is a wonderful doggy spa just after you emerge from the dog walk.\nWe were slightly disappointed by the amount of toilets & showers considering the size of the park. One of the doors of the toilets in the women’s block doesn’t close, rendering it unusable.\nOverall we were pleased with the holiday park & the snack shack was a welcome bonus for the start of our break.\nWould recommend Woodovis as a wonderful place to holiday.",

My only complaints were:\n- that it was so full they stopped people from entering the pool, but only once they had paid, were changed, and on poolside! We even had the reception ring down to check beforehand, but when we got down to the pool it was at capacity.\n- The other slight issue was that the toddler/splash pool closes at 6pm whereas the training pool closes at 6.45 (which we weren't informed of).

Seems like a failure of maintenance but a number of showers have already stopped working. The toilets are badly damaged as well. It’s a shame to see £40m investment not being looked after!",

Reception team were lovely. Everything has been thought about. Smart wristbands for the lockers, extra large family changing rooms, it's clean and modern. The learner pool and shallow splash pool is excellent and very warm. The warmth hits you when you walk in! Recommend trying this pool!",

One of the biggest issues is the lack of cleanliness... the grime and unpleasant smells, especially in the health suite, are unacceptable.\n\nTo make matters worse, guests are asked to leave the health suite midday for cleaning, which shows poor planning. Even more concerning, I’ve witnessed female cleaners entering the male changing rooms and beginning to clean while men are fully naked... completely inappropriate and uncomfortable.\n\nThe health suite is consistently dirty, poorly maintained, and often smells bad. The jacuzzi is also out of order around 50% of the time. It's an absolute joke for a place that’s supposed to promote health, hygiene, and relaxation.",

The biggest issue is how overcrowded it gets during peak hours—it’s nearly impossible to get on any of the machines without waiting a long time, which completely ruins the workout experience. It feels like they’ve taken on far too many members for the size of the gym, and there’s no real effort to manage the congestion.\n\nOn top of that, cleanliness is a serious problem. The gym often smells bad, and the equipment doesn’t seem to be cleaned or maintained as well as it should be. It’s not a pleasant environment to work out in, and it makes me question the hygiene standards in place.\n\nAnother major downside is the attitude of some of the staff. While I understand that working in a busy gym can be stressful, certain staff members come across as actively unfriendly, almost as if they’re discouraging people from coming in—perhaps because they know the gym is already too full. It’s not what you expect when you’re paying for a membership.\n\nOverall, this gym has been a frustrating experience. If you’re looking for a clean, welcoming, and well-managed place to work out, I’d strongly suggest looking elsewhere.",

I asked whether it was possible to enter just to see if it was cleaner, but no one responded via the intercom at the entrance. I travelled there for nothing.\n\nThere are also many rusty machines, and not all of them work properly. You want to wipe the equipment before training, but paper towels are often unavailable.\n\nOverall impression — very unpleasant, old and unhygienic.

Facilities and supplies are plentiful and staff were not only very polite and friendly, but also falling over themselves to help with whatever I asked. Food looked and smelled amazing (I was gutted to be completely devoid of any sort of an appetite during my visit) and was very reasonably priced indeed. I cannot believe that in 4 years of truck driving I’ve never been here before - I’ll definitely be making an effort to stop here again! Can’t recommend it enough.",

It was a really super, friendly welcome and was very much appreciated. We were given great information,  clear and concise and we weren't rushed to find a pitch. The pitches are large with lots of space around them and the views across the site are very nice indeed. Plenty of nature around and the hedgerows aren't manicured to within an inch of their lives. A bit like being in a meadow. It was very enjoyable. Shower and toilet facilities are clean and smart with large shower cubicles with plenty of hot water and thankfully you don't have to push a button every few seconds for water. Also, the water drop off and pick up is well designed and clean. I normally begrudge paying UK campsite prices however I'd happily pay £23.50 with C&MH membership here. It was well worth it and we will definitely return",

The big problem is the out door shower the only shower it was disgusting looked like it had never been cleaned and to get to it you had to walk through hundreds of fly's and wasps not fit for humans. as a result we stayed 1 night and left. Raised my concerns with the hosts they read the messages and don't respond. as a result put in a claim for 1 night refund airBnB phone me and tried to get me a refund from them but they would not. Since Airbnb then selfs have refund me the night. I would avoid this place mainly cause of the showers but from my experience the hosts are not bothered about any concerns they will respond quickly when you want to book",

          "reviewText": "We stayed four nights camping at Crealy Adventure Park, Devon, and overall it was a really enjoyable family break. I’d give it 3.5 out of 5 stars – the theme park is the main highlight, but a few things could be improved to make the stay even better.\n\nThe campsite itself is very clean, with clearly marked and spacious pitches. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful, which made check-in and day-to-day questions really easy. Security is obvious and reassuring, so I felt completely safe with my young children. The whole site is well lit at night, bins were always tidy, and the washing up areas were spotless. The showers were warm and perfectly usable, though I wouldn’t have minded if they were a touch hotter.\n\nOur pitch had electric and water with no issues, and everything felt modern and safe. The ground was hard and a little uneven in places, with some dry patches due to the time of year, but nothing that couldn’t be managed with stronger metal pegs.\n\nThe on-site shop at reception was really well stocked, though as expected a little more expensive than a supermarket – handy for essentials. Costa coffee being available in the mornings was a big win for me.\n\nThe kids absolutely loved the theme park – it’s the big draw here and perfect for children up to young teenagers. My girls would happily rate it 5/5 just for that alone. They made new friends, had loads of fun, and for them that’s what a holiday is all about.\n\nThat said, there are a few things that bring the rating down for me. Some of the extras are quite pricey, especially the Berg cart rentals at £12 per hour – with multiple kids wanting to ride, it adds up very quickly. The play parks around the resort were fine but fairly basic, and my two would have loved a splash pad or pool as an extra option for downtime.\n\nFood in the clubhouse was ok – a bit pricey for what it was and smaller portion sizes (think Wetherspoons-level). Service was sometimes a little slow, but the “kids eat for £1” deal was excellent value and made it much more affordable.\n\nEntertainment is where I felt things could be stronger. It’s family-friendly, with bingo, live music, and a headline act each night. During our stay we saw wrestling, a bubble show, and a magician – all fun and great for younger children, but everything wound down by around 9–9:30pm. It would be nice to see a bit more variety, including options that entertain the adults too, and maybe extend it later into the evening to round off the day.\n\nDespite those points, we had a really lovely week. The campsite is safe, family-oriented, and the theme park more than delivers for children. My girls came away buzzing with excitement, and that’s what matters most.\n\nFinal verdict: 3.5/5. A great choice for families with kids in the right age range, with plenty of positives – but with a few tweaks, it could easily push up to a 4.5 or 5.",

The toilet blocks and showers were spotless, which made a big difference, though the showers were a bit hit and miss — some stayed on longer than others, and a few of the locks were quite stiff.\n\nThe electricity set-up via the app was a bit of a faff at first, just something extra to think about, but once I got the hang of it I was confident enough to manage.\n\nWe were quite disappointed with the children’s evening entertainment. While it’s great to see so much effort put into it, it felt a little too pushy — we’re on holiday to relax, not to be dragged onto the dance floor every other song. It also seemed that the same children were being chosen again and again for games, which was disheartening for our daughter who waited twice and wasn’t picked. A bit more fairness and variety would really improve this. On the other hand, the adult evening entertainment was fantastic and a real highlight.\n\nAnother small downside was discovering we needed to pay extra for the indoor pool. We completely understand the need to book, but given the already high cost of the site, it felt a bit much to be charged again.\n\nOverall, it’s a lovely site and we really enjoyed our stay. Next time, we’d probably use it for just a couple of nights rather than our base for the whole week, and put some of the savings towards exploring more of the beautiful coastline.",

The facilities are brilliant, from the spacious, well-equipped gym to the rooftop restaurant.\n\nThe rooms are lovely; our suite overlooked the farmlands and was thoughtfully designed, offering plenty of space to move around. The bathroom was also well laid out, with quality fittings and a shower that had excellent water pressure.\n\nWhat truly stood out, however, was the service from all the staff. Whether it was the reception team, restaurant staff, or housekeeping, everyone we interacted with displayed genuine warmth and a sincere desire to help.\n\nI would especially like to commend Teresa, who was an absolute delight in welcoming us and making us feel both at home and valued throughout our stay. She was always keen to assist and offered thoughtful, practical advice. Jessica Pascual was also incredibly helpful in arranging our room extension, practical, efficient, and considerate throughout the process. Emma and Prince were equally respectful and professional.\n\nThe level of customer service throughout the hotel is exceptional and rare to find in the UK, one of the most courteous and capable front desk teams we have encountered in recent times.\n\nAs Platinum Elite members, we truly appreciated how the staff went out of their way to recognise our loyalty, a thoughtful and much-valued gesture.\n\nThe breakfast spread was generous, though I felt there could be a few more options for fresh fruit and vegetarians. That said, the service remained impeccable.\n\nThe common areas of the hotel are beautifully furnished, and despite the presence of large business groups, there was always a quiet space to relax. Complimentary parking is another wonderful perk, especially given the hotel’s proximity to the city.\n\nOverall, the staff at this hotel made us feel truly at home, we can’t wait to return.",

I would recommend to them they get a rack for a variety of bars, they have Ez bars, but no cambered ones. There's a huge bucket of cable machine handles for the lat press, but a rack with a variety of bars might encourage people to use the benches more and introduce a new exercise without taking up space.\n\nThey also have a ridiculous sign upstairs in the cardio bit, highlighting that they sell cakes in reception. Everybody knows this, we pass by on the way in and out and don't need the sign. It's curious how they want to highlight the cakes and muffins but don't selly fruit, or savoury food. Seems like a real mistep in marketing to me.\n\nAlso, trying to find a locker can be a problem as people are always leaving their belongs in lockers with no lock on so those of us who did bother bringing a lock and can't use a locker cos they are all taken.\n\nOn the upside, the staff are lovely, and it wouldn't take much to turn this into a great gym, but it needs modernising, there's an out of date sign by the water fountain in the weights where it says phones are prohibited in the gym. Yet everyone is on one cos they do actually allow them. There doesn't seem to much of a coherent management policy.",

However, I tried to go swimming however due to very short opening times and 30 minutes slots all being booked this wasn't an option - I looked at all other centres and noticed the same thing. Then I tried to book some classes for in a weeks time, they were all already fully booked. I then attended the gym to find half the machines screens weren't working and it was impossible to complete a workout. I contacted BHlive online as I'm on a monthly contact and this was my first visit and wasnt offered any apology and simply told I would have to pay until after march's payment. I'm really disappointed in the lack of facilities available, poor opening times, run down facilities and then ontop of that the response from BHlive - not at all what I expected when I joined and will be returning to the village gym instead where facilities are open all the time with a very well equipt gym.",

She helped by talking through the plan going forward after hearing my story. I have a gym membership now and have started by swimming and attending aqua classes which you can book easily on line when available. They are amazing! So far I've done the hydro classes on weekday mornings, and the rehab class on a Wednesday evening. Different instructors each time but all have been so enjoyable. A great workout which you can do to your comfort levels. Each time I've left the pool I've felt like jelly without having the discomfort during the class. Thanks to these classes I'm already feeling more confident in my abilities and getting stronger day by day. All ages and abilities are welcome and I would highly recommend.",

Big clear sign, Starbucks on site, restaurant and bar on site as well as their own gym/health club with steam room and sauna. Rooms were nice and bright and spacious. We had a nice walk in shower, only downside was no bath mat inside and I have two small children so I had to request one even though I had mentioned prior arrival. The check in process was very straight forward and easy they also have self check in points for a speedy process. Receptionists were friendly and welcoming overall. Nice lounge area with a tv for anyone who wants to just sit and relax. Unfortunately we didn't have time to visit their restaurant but I would definitely consider going back to this hotel just to try the food and vibes they had to offer. We didn't have breakfast as there wasn't a good wide enough range unfortunately neither for the kids or ourselves and didn't really cater to all needs which is a shame. You should really consider offering a continental breakfast as well as a hot breakfast buffet option but with a wider range of options suitable for children as well as adults. I've only knocked one star due to the points I mentioned but I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for someone decent and nice. It's also close to the town centre and many others attractions. Don't miss out.\nThere are stairs as well as a lift available to the guests.\nWe made use of the swimming facilities as well as using the steam room and sauce for over 16's which was also very relaxing too. They have set times to follow which are given to you upon check in for family swim times and also provide you with a locker key and towel when entering.\n\nThe reception manager was very professional and he made a seating area for us one night where there was no where to sit and arranged a space for me and my two children and also gave my children two big chocolate coins which was very kind of him.\n\nThere was also a lovely man in the Starbucks on site called George who was very friendly and warm and he also made us smile with a great honest service which is always nice.\n\nMy children enjoyed their time as did we and I hope we can return sometime soon.\nOverall it was a nice and pleasant experience and we look forward in returning in the nearby future.",

Swimming lessons are great, good quality pools and friendly teachers, changing rooms are good as well as the showers but the toilets can be a bit rough and disgusting but overall, I'm quite happy. I'll be continuing to use this centre until the end. The only major bad thing is that whenever I try to call to book an activity like today, the wait can get so annoying. Today, I tried to call for Thursday, and I waited for an hour +, and they said that I was FIRST in queue. Anyways, to finish off, all good, but wait time for calls can be improved. If the team sees this, I'd like to book a swimming activity for Thursday around afternoon time. Thank you",

Like most things post-Covid, you can't just turn up and swim, but need to book your session in advance but as an existing Everyone Active member, this was easy to do through their app. Not sure how you'd do this as a non- member.\n\nI was surprised to find it's more pricey for a swim than in our local pool in Hornchurch, which is a very new building and, therefore, has more modern facilities. Also not a fan of the boom which chops the main pool down in size, so it's no longer a full length. I understand the reasoning about creating an area for kids, but I think roping of the end of the pool would have been fine and I doubt it has resulted in the pool being used more for galas.\n\nAs an older municipal pool, it does have a proper, separate, diving pool which you can use during public sessions, but those using it are expected to be able to swim an entire length of the pool unaided to jump off the boards.\n\nMy daughter can float and swim unaided, but has not had the opportunity to do a full length of a pool yet (and would probably not want to due to getting bored), but she wanted to try the board as she saw others doing it. I wasn't aware of the rule and was confident in her ability to jump in and immediately come back up (trying to teach her to swim underwater is hindered by her super floatiness) and get to the side, plus I was going to go first and be in the water ready for her. Anyway, she jumped without fear, loved it and was fine, but I then realised the lifeguard had been calling me to ask if she could swim a full length or not - I was too busy watching and encouraging my daughter (ooops)!\n\nChanging rooms are okay, but split between members and public, with only 2 showers in the public section and they're both cold water only.\n\nWe went into the public side, but went into the members side to shower as that had 4 showers with adjustable controls (got water) but the lockers on that side need you to bring your own padlock to use them, which seems a bit weird.\n\nI don't know if, by members, they mean people who pay a monthly fee for gym access or something, but I think it's ridiculous to segregate the changing areas and only allow people who pay more access to hot water in the showers.\n\nThe toilets were also better on the member's side.\n\nAll in all, this is a site that needs a good overhaul and investment to improve the changing rooms, with no segregation for members / public and more showers with hot water.\n\nAnd get rid of the boom!\n\nFinally, the car park is council run and you have to pay to park.",

It used to smell horrific in the changing areas, the showers used to never work, the pool was showing signs on mould and it used to look really dated. Since the Council took over, all these things have improved massively. They have also started putting toilet cleaner down the toilets. If this was still an Everyone Active ran facility. I would of said run for your lifes. But it is so much better.

At £15/month on a simple monthly contract (with blue light discount), it’s incredibly competitive - you’re not going to find better value in the area.\nFacilities: The free weights section has everything you need - squat racks, bench press, and a full range of dumbbells. They’ve also got plenty of machines if that’s your preference. The facilities are clean and well-maintained throughout. The changing rooms and showers are good quality - definitely a step up from budget gym chains, though not quite at premium gym levels. As a bonus, they have a sauna and steam room included, which is fantastic at this price point. No pool, but that’s not expected for £15/month.\nAtmosphere: Really welcoming environment with a good mix of people and no intimidating “lads only” vibe. Everyone’s considerate about sharing equipment - I’ve never had trouble getting on what I need, even during busy periods. The personal trainers are genuinely friendly and approachable, always saying hello and creating a positive atmosphere. The reception staff can be hit or miss in terms of friendliness - they’re running the entire leisure center so understandably stretched thin (typical of council-run facilities), but once you’re in the gym itself, everyone’s super friendly.\nPractical details: Parking in the main car park costs a couple of pounds per visit, which is worth factoring in. The studio hosts various classes, and the staff are flexible - as a dancer, they let me use the studio space to practice when it’s not being used for classes, even though it’s not technically part of my membership.\nMinor downsides: You have to cancel membership via email rather than in person, which is a bit annoying. It can get busy at peak times, but the respectful atmosphere means it’s never a problem.\nOverall, it’s not the fanciest gym you’ll ever see, but it ticks all the boxes for a solid, no-nonsense workout environment at an unbeatable price. Highly recommended.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "reviewText": "This is a review of the gym at Elstead Hotel, this is open to the public and I was a member on/off for 5 years.\n\nThe TLDR of this review is AVOID THIS GYM. There are much better gyms in the area for a cheaper price. If you have to be a member here, join on a 3 month contract and DO NOT join the gym for 12 months as it is due to be knocked down soon and the hotel will not refund you regardless of the amount of notice you give.\n\nI initially joined in 2019 before moving to the superior Better Gym which unfortunately closed which meant I re-joined at Elstead sometime in 2021. Firstly, in that time there has been absolutely no improvements made to the facilities. Much like the rest of the hotel the gym is severely outdated and essentially falling apart. The maintenance man does his best but there's only so much you can do with equipment and facilities that are 20+ years old.\n\nI could accept the old apparatus if the gym was well kept, clean and hygienic, however this is not the case. The gym floors are always filthy, the changing rooms are covered in dirty grimy water, the showers are often clogged with hair and the toilets regularly don't have hand towels/toilet paper. You'll often see 1 of 3 cleaners at the gym reception desk but (sorry to say as they all seem lovely) they do next to no work. Rather then giving the place a much needed tidy they seem to spend the majority of their working day hiding away in the storage cupboard / plant room.\n\nBefore I finish, I'll quickly run through some of the other many issues there are with this place.\n- Dumbbells only go up to 20kg\n- No 16kg dumbbells\n- No barbells\n- They have 2 benches but they are both short & poor quality\n- 1 filthy gym mat\n- No squat rack\n- No pull up bar\n- A treadmill that I'm sure has been out of order for 5 years\n- The hot tub is actually a cold tub\n- The steam room door doesn't close properly which obviously lets all the heat out\n- The wooden sauna walls and roof are damaged seemingly beyond repair, the sauna is also a lot colder then others I have been in\n- Only 1 toilet in each changing room\n- Lack of a wet / dry area in the changing rooms meaning the whole room turns into a boggy swamp\n- No hairdryer for around 6 months, recently one was added again but it seems to be one from the 19th century so surprising doesn't work too well\n\nTo finish (and most disappointingly for myself) the staff at the hotel have just generally got ruder. I'm not referring to the gym cleaners or maintenance men, more so the hotel reception staff. Maybe they don't care anymore as the hotel is due to be demolished soon and make way for flats, but any sort of positive/friendly customer service has seemingly gone out the window. The manager is a pleasant man but seems to have an issue with telling the truth, I asked to sign up to the gym on a 1 month contract (knowing that 1. they used to offer this and 2. the hotel will be flattened soon) but he said they have never offered 1 month contracts. This simply is not true and I have since spoke to 10-15 other gym go-ers who have agreed with me that the gym used to offer 1 month contracts. With the imminent demolition of the building, it is disappointing not to offer a contract shorter then 3 months for financial security. However even more disappointing is for the manager to flat out lie about offering them.",

Massive lockers, amazing showers and makeup/hair area with lots of products if you've forgotten your own. Louise was hosting the class and she was incredibly welcoming and made sure I was aware of and happy with the content of the class and assured me that I could take it at my own speed. The class was challenging (REALLY delivered on lower body!!) but also well-paced. Had a vegan Fat Joe shake afterwards to refuel which was delicious as well. My *only* piece of constructive feedback would be slightly better signposting of whether treadmills are involved in the class or not - if nothing else but so that those of us who aren't great runners can psych ourselves up for it!",

Bournemouth also has poor hygiene - the male changing rooms often reek of urine.  The Bournemouth gym manager is unresponsive to constructive criticism & negative feedback and disengaged entirely from the conversation.\n\nOther than Bournemouth I would give a 4 star rating.  My other gym I use often at Streatham is pretty good with a friendly environment and kit is rarely broken.

Pool is heated to around 29° during the summer season, and there is an extensive timetable. Staff were friendly and the manager went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Male and female changing rooms (not individual cubicles) were warm and clean. Poolside warm showers and lockers (£1 refundable). The pool regulars were really welcoming and like a chat.

They have these rules that nobody seems to abide, it is not kids friendly, dogs roaming around freely, the soft play area is outside the gate area, the enclosed play area is actually a place full of hazards for kids (feel free to check the pictures) and the A31 nearby, means constant background noise, not exactly white noise. The shower had lukewarm water and, as an adult, you need to keep pressing the button if you want a full shower, not just a splash. We were conveniently allocated a pitch right in front of the toilets, showers, outside sinks and bins, imagine the noise and smell. They should not be able to rent pitches this close to the amenities and then have a no noise rule. Would not return, ever.",

They have these rules that nobody seems to abide, it is not kids friendly, dogs roaming around freely, the soft play area is outside the gate area, the enclosed play area is actually a place full of hazards for kids (feel free to check the pictures) and the A31 nearby, means constant background noise, not exactly white noise. The shower had lukewarm water and, as an adult, you need to keep pressing the button if you want a full shower, not just a splash. We were conveniently allocated a pitch right in front of the toilets, showers, outside sinks and bins, imagine the noise and smell. They should not be able to rent pitches this close to the amenities and then have a no noise rule. Would not return, ever.",

As you’d expect, given the name, the site affords spectacular views over the Purbecks. Absolutely glorious scenery.\nWith children in tow, camping is a great option for us, we chose to stay in one of the Tipis. What a memorable experience! Spacious yet cosy, the Tipi delights both children & adults! Toilets and warm, powerful showers are all provided in several areas within immaculately clean, rustic shepherds huts. Washing up stations are dotted around the site, car parking is ample and fire pits are available to hire. All giving this site its well-deserved 5/5…. but the amenities, though great, are not the very best part of The View; Cathy & Kate, a friendly and welcoming mother/daughter duo, are exceptional hosts. Both devoted to the ecological merits of their home, their animals and the wildlife of the area, these two beautiful humans embrace guests with warmth, easy chats and an invitation to join them and their musical friends around the large communal fire for evenings of food and song. (We were lucky to arrive on a night when Cathy’s daughter, Kate’s sister Ellie made fantastic pizzas - bring cash to contribute to the pot).\nThe View soothes the soul, delights the senses and is so much more than a field to camp in. It is a community; people, place, sound, sights, wildlife, spirituality…  If you visit, be prepared to leave The View full of gratitude for the sense of well-being and happiness that is so naturally instilled. We did. We’ll definitely be back!",

This isn't a curfew, so quiet campfire evenings can be enjoyed till late.\nChristine also offers safe wood burners  for hire, along with all the wood supplies you need. Reasonably priced too.\nThis campsite is beautiful, and over the years we have visited, only positive things have been added.",

Very pretty holiday park, great layout, caravan easy to find.\n\nWe booked a deluxe caravan which was nice, clean and all the extras as you would expect.\n\nThe club, people are queuing from 5pm to get into the club, if you don’t want to queue, then do not expect to get a table, I was almost fishing with some idiot over a table I had been waiting for for over half an hour. We tried again on the Saturday night and gave up, just not a pleasant experience. The club is not big enough for the amount of people, entertainment was pretty decent though, so if you can get a table it’s probably worth going.\n\nThe pool, the coldest pool I have ever been in, stayed in for 5 mins to jump into broken showers. Could be so much better but really don’t bother going to the swimming pool.\n\nWent for a curry at the local Nepalese restaurant which is just over a mile away, very nice food so well worth a visit if you like a curry.\n\nOver all mixed experience, I would stay again as a last resort.",

It has lots of activities for family's with children of all ages, including an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, amusement arcade, crazy golf, play areas and nightly entertainment. Its also great to take dogs too. The caravan we stayed in was spacious and clean  although they are packed in and are very close to the neighbouring vans..I would have preferred a little more space.\nThe onsite food places like the fish and chip shop  and chicken van were really nice if a little expensive as was the onsite shop,  but if needs must its there!.x\nWe went out of season so it was relatively quiet  i probably wouldn't go back peak season as it would be way to busy and cramped for me. Overall we enjoyed our stay of 3 nights.",

The pitches are located approximately 10 min walk away from the entertainment area which means they’re lovely and quiet. The communal shower blocks are kept very clean. The entertainment here was fantastic! Great for all the family, with kids shows and singers/dancers later on, also bingo! They have a great arcade and restaurant area. Aswell as 2 play areas, good for children of all ages. Would recommend!",

All the staff were lovely and we got fresh cooked biscuits the chef made as a thank you on check out.
