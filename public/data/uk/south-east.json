The changing rooms felt tired and not very clean. The steam room door kept swinging open, there was very little steam, and because the outlet was positioned above knee height, my lower body actually got cold rather than warmed.\nThe sauna was hot but so packed with people that it felt stifling and uncomfortable, rather than like a calm, healing heat. All the showers were cold as well, so instead of leaving relaxed, we left shivering. We were given a full refund, but overall it was not the restorative visit we had hoped for.",

Clean and warm and well maintained. Lockers are free so to speak but do not lock I think you can use a padlock but realistically your in a place for only families and it’s not like your usual manic swimming centre so we didn’t have much concerns about that. They also serve food and drinks the coffee smelt great on arrival. Well worth a visit as it’s truly a family vibe with good facilities tailored for babies pretty cool to offer such facilities when closing themselves off to business for strictly family use to me I think that speaks volumes as it’s not about the quantity of customers they could have it’s the quality of facilities they can offer for a select customer that’s good business for any customers and a bold business decision on their part. Fair play to them we look forwards to visiting again.",

The whole place was spotless and felt really hygienic. Nice and warm as soon as you enter. Changing rooms were a good size and had several baby units you could change you baby on without having to bend down! We used the purple pool which was lovely, it had low lighting and pool was very warm. There also a small cafe as you walk in which was reasonably prices and the brownies were delicious. All the staff we met were really friendly, there was a young girl who first served us who was really nice and even offered to carry out bags as we had our hands full. Definitely worth signing up as it reduces the price of swimming and also food/drink in the cafe. We can't wait to come back again.",

The pool we used (Pool1) was very dated and the water was extremely salty. The changing room we were told to use is shared across genders which as mothers with young children we weren't thrilled about. Also a very strong smell of urine, this may have been due to the blocked toilet across from it which wasn’t ideal. I know there are seperate cubicles but still… we had babies and there were only two changing tables with no sanitisation inbetween babies using them, unlike other swimming schools catered for babies. That said, we did enjoy using the pool all together and the babies enjoyed it.The staff were friendly and the new pool looks really nice.  But due to the cleanliness of some (not all) areas and the changing room situation I probably wouldn’t return with a young baby. I really hope this review is seen as helpful feedback and not replied to in any other way.",

The pool is ok. It is not a lengths pool and it is fairly shallow, but you can just about get a proper swim in. The sauna is small but decent and the steam room is decent but the lighting could be dimmer. However, the whole place could do with a DEEP CLEAN and redecorating. The changing rooms are dirty and outdated. There is a mould issue that needs addressing. The standards should be higher in my opinion considering this is part of The Hilton, and the price isn’t cheap.",

The pool is ok. It is not a lengths pool and it is fairly shallow, but you can just about get a proper swim in. The sauna is small but decent and the steam room is decent but the lighting could be dimmer. However, the whole place could do with a DEEP CLEAN and redecorating. The changing rooms are dirty and outdated. There is a mould issue that needs addressing. The standards should be higher in my opinion considering this is part of The Hilton, and the price isn’t cheap.",

I messaged them to ask if there were any conditions, and I was told the only significant one was a minimum term of one month. No mention was made of the 30-day notice period.\n\nI went to the facilities to try them out, but they were closing and asked me to return the next day. I specifically asked if I could swim for free that month as advertised, and they confirmed this again, with no additional conditions mentioned. I couldn’t go the following day, but they later called me and we agreed I would come back, still with no further information disclosed.\n\nI am traveling in 10 days and simply wanted to try the pool once, with the intention of signing up properly when I return to Brighton. I prepared everything in advance, including bringing my wetsuit and assembling new fins.\n\nWhen I finally arrived, I was told that I would still have to pay for the following month even if I didn’t use the facility, because cancellations require 30 days’ notice. As a result, I couldn’t swim at all.\n\nThis was extremely frustrating. The advertisement was misleading, and despite communicating with them multiple times across different channels, this crucial condition was never mentioned.

The impression we got was that they'd rather brush the security issues under the carpet than spend the additional money on upgrading their security.  They have now lost 4 customers as a result.\nAdvice is, only take what you need even if you are putting items in a locker.   Do not leave cash in there!  There are blind spots in that GYM that allow opportunists to go in and help themselves.  And when something does go missing, make sure you ask the GYM for a Police Ref number rather than just relying on the advice from them that they have reported it to the police.  Whist there are signs around the GYM advising customers that they are responsible for their own belongings, for the amount of money we all paid them monthly, I would have expected a higher degree of security and some decent lockers!",

However, there’s no air conditioning - in summer it’s very stuffy and hot inside. The changing rooms are in a poor state, scruffy, broken lockers, and haven’t been touched since the previous tenants left, other than to remove soap from the showers. The sauna and steam room have never opened despite being advertised from the start. There are no classes here. This would be a great place to offer lifting instruction to groups but there’s nada.

I did not realise my bank account was not compatible with direct debit, so the gym contacted to let me know they weren’t able to set up the direct debit. There was nothing in the email about me not being allowed into the gym.\n\nWhen I went to the gym my code had been blocked and I could not enter the gym, despite the fact I had been charged £36 for the month. I rang the assistance buzzer at the door for twenty minutes and nobody responded. I had no access to the gym for the whole weekend and had to wait until the customer service line was open on Monday to ask them to let me into the gym.\n\nWhen I rang the customer service line I explained the situation, the woman then said I have access to the gym until the 6th November.

There was nothing in the email about me not being allowed into the gym.\n\nWhen I went to the gym my code had been blocked and I could not enter the gym, despite the fact I had been charged £36 for the month. I rang the assistance buzzer at the door for twenty minutes and nobody responded. I had no access to the gym for the whole weekend and had to wait until the customer service line was open on Monday to ask them to let me into the gym.\n\nWhen I rang the customer service line I explained the situation, the woman then said I have access to the gym until the 6th November.

A brilliant instructor led the games in the pool (including two children who couldn't swim well..... but you wouldn't have known it, they were helped along to join in with the rest).  Then upstairs to a beautifully decorated room (banners and streamers and balloons) for party food - and a delicious cake (specially hand baked by one of the staff).  The kids had such a great time - and totally stress free for the parents.

Upstairs it just seemed to be the cafe and cinema room. It was advertised as the biggest/best sauna on the south coast, so happy I’d never tried the others.

The staff was very helpful and polite this is why I have given the Brighton sauna 5 stars I would be definitely going here again! It’s good Value for money and nice and clean as well,  if you are a first timer at your first time at a Gay Sauna and don’t know what today my few tips would help, always be Polite at all times. If you like the person and the person likes your he will give you the eye to let you know he was to have fun with you. The next tip is No means No always remember that you would get the odd drunk guy who would try it on but you have to say No, the next tip is clean your mess after your selfs when you had some fun. It’s not nice to walk into a Cubicle when there is mess every where! The other tip is make sure you drink lots of water because you can get dehydrated because it is a sauna! And the last tip I would say is have fun I hope this has helped so if you never been to a gay sauna and what to try then try the Brighton Sauna !",

I often find saunas too intense and have to come out every couple of minutes but the electric one was a great temperature for me and I even enjoyed the cold baths in the middle of winter. I thought 30 mins would seem long but could’ve happily stayed for an hour.\n\nThe staff were lovely, but I do find it strange that there’s absolutely no way to contact Luna Hut over the phone. I had a booking issue that was time-sensitive and could only fill in a contact form. Luckily they did get back to me in time but I think it’s weird not to be able to talk to someone when it’s an experience that might come with a lot of questions!\n\nAlso, I’m obsessed with the cute felt sauna hats but after my session was told to put them back in the pile. Those hats must be SWEATY. I hope they at least wash them at the end of each day 😬",

Our experience was unfortunately affected by some other selfish sauna users- being much too loud and obnoxious in the sauna, adding way too much water to the rocks and making it unbearable in the sauna. Perhaps a brief run through of expectations for customers before they enter the sauna could stop this from happening in future? But the space and staff were super lovely and I highly recommend!!",

There is a nice café area for drinks and light meals, a full relaxing spa down the spiral stairs and rooms upstairs to rest. It's inexpensive for the amount of time and facilities you can use too. Very clean and the water is tested regularly. The big jacuzzi is lovely and the cool pool is good to plunge in after the sauna or steam room for circulation. I know some use this spa for adult reasons, but I find it amazing as a regular spa. A good winter retreat from the cold weather and so relaxing. Remember to take a big towel if like me you're on the bigger side. Unfortunately you'll always get a few bad apples in the public who try to buck the rules, but the staff are firm with them so if you think you can film, put hands on women without consent, stay beyond a session time or try to hide and stay as a single male during couples spa time you'll rightly be told to leave. I appreciate the rules and keeping us safe. The owner is lovely btw!",

Though the staff are lovely and accommodating, and the location is perfect for the train station, the machines and equipment are old and tired, the showers don't have locks on the doors, and one of the female toilets doesn't even have a toilet seat on it with the other stall having toilet paper on the door hook instead of the toilet paper holder. This is only the cusp of the problems. The bathrooms and changing rooms look as though they are rarely cleaned and there appears to be an over abundance of cardio machines in comparison to squat racks (only 3!). I could go on, but at the end of the day I think it's clear I wouldn't recommend this gym. It needs a massive overhaul in terms of renovation, cleaning schedule and new machines.",

Other options  are for £6/£31  and so on. £ 12  feed you everything  from menu apart from fully monty grill  £15.95\nFood menu is massive,including  burgers,curry,kebabs,home made pizza sandwiches  and so on. Food is awesome!  Trucker next to me said they try to kill you with the size of those portions. I saw different  platters out and all was great and when ask all said amazing. So a big shout out to a kitchen staff!\n\nAll place  very clean and tidy, don't forget to take token for a shower(7min plenty enough)  shower  room with massive space and regulated temperature of water 😎💦😍 so in summer - winner.\n\nStaff mostly  very friendly  and kind, one bad egg but it might  be not his day so I won't  blame or judge  his life  on that. We all had it.\n\nIf by any  chance  I will be around, even  for a sneaky 45 I will be there!\n\nI would recommend it 100%",

Other options  are for £6/£31  and so on. £ 12  feed you everything  from menu apart from fully monty grill  £15.95\nFood menu is massive,including  burgers,curry,kebabs,home made pizza sandwiches  and so on. Food is awesome!  Trucker next to me said they try to kill you with the size of those portions. I saw different  platters out and all was great and when ask all said amazing. So a big shout out to a kitchen staff!\n\nAll place  very clean and tidy, don't forget to take token for a shower(7min plenty enough)  shower  room with massive space and regulated temperature of water 😎💦😍 so in summer - winner.\n\nStaff mostly  very friendly  and kind, one bad egg but it might  be not his day so I won't  blame or judge  his life  on that. We all had it.\n\nIf by any  chance  I will be around, even  for a sneaky 45 I will be there!\n\nI would recommend it 100%",

After we parked, I was BLOCKED by a running frigo and I couldn’t move forward or backward. It was my favorite parking and I used to park here all the time since 2016, now I avoid it. The mushrooms chicken was not cooked enough, I didn’t send it back because it was impossible to do anything about it after that and I didn’t want to find some ‘spices’ added. They couldn’t provide me the bank card receipt which I needed. And the showers are good, but they should have start/stop buton, especially for women, 7-8 minutes it is not enough, or at least it should play the sound one minute before ending, not when the water stops so we are able to rinse.",

I felt pretty shoddily treated. I won't come back until the policy changes\n\nThe claim is that the truckers won't have enough shower access but when I went to the loo last time there was an empty female shower that didn't look too well used.  Also, how many truckers are female?\n\nThanks for responding and for considering a change in policy.  I've added a star back for that.\nI'll add five ⭐️ if you allow locals to use the showers too. You could link it to buying a meal? I've bought two meals there recently  so perhaps we could have some sort of loyalty points that allows a shower to be purchased for every meal or two drinks etc?",

First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

Looks a bit tired, could do with a refresh.\n \nOverall, a convenient and well-equipped station for locals and travelers heading to/from coast.",

It was a journey into an oasis of automotive care and exceptional service.\n\nFirst, I treated my car to a spa day in their self-service wash bay. The equipment was state-of-the-art, user-friendly, and incredibly efficient, leaving my car sparkling like a diamond under the summer sun. The water pressure was perfect, and the soap suds had a delightful aroma that made the whole experience surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nNext, I moved on to the air pump station. Here too, Esso impressed with its precision and ease of use. The air pump was like a gentle giant, perfectly inflating my tyres to the ideal pressure, ensuring a smoother, safer drive. It was a breeze to use, and my car seemed to drive away happier for it.\n\nThe screen wash top-up was another highlight. The fluid was of top-notch quality, leaving my windshield crystal clear with a streak-free finish. It's the little things that make a big difference, and Esso clearly understands this.\n\nBut the pièce de résistance was the super petrol fuel. This wasn't just fuel; it was like a performance enhancer for my car. The engine purred with contentment, and I could feel the difference in power and smoothness as I drove away. It was as if my car had been given a new lease on life.\n\nThroughout my visit, the station was immaculate, well-organized, and radiated a sense of pride in service. The staff, though I had little interaction with them, were smiling and ready to assist.\n\nIn conclusion, this Esso petrol station isn't just a place to fill up your car. It's a haven for vehicle enthusiasts and anyone who wants to give their car the treatment it deserves. Five stars don't do justice to the exceptional experience I had. Esso, you've set a new standard for petrol stations everywhere!",

          "reviewText": "Seadragon was a pretty basic hostel overall. The price was very fair, and the amenities reflect the budget accordingly. The beds were comfy, but there is no curtain or anything for privacy. There is a power strip of outlets near the bottom bunk bed for the entire bed, so the person at the top must have a long wire to reach the top, which might be in the way of the person below. There is no surface near the top bunk for placing anything, such as a phone or book. Most other hostels have a small shelf or a bag that hangs for small items beside the bed. The room I stayed in had a reading light for each bed that clipped onto the railing, and 4 out of 4 of the lights did not turn on. My roommates and I all tried ours and discovered they were a useless accessory. This meant the only way to have light in the room was the overhead light, or individual flash lights.\n\nThere are not many bathrooms, but they are all individual which is nice for privacy. However, this means if three people want to shower at the same time, you cannot use a toilet. This was also the worst shower I've ever had in a hostel. The showerhead was very tall, probably about 1.8m high, and it had the \"rainfall\" shower head, but the pressure was so low that the water came out as a light drizzle, and by the time it reached me, it was cold, even when the heat was set to the highest setting. It was the most ineffective and useless shower system, I would have been better off filling a cup in the sink and rinsing off with that.\n\nAs far as reception: when I booked the reservation, I had a received an email from the hostel that confirmed my check in date and stated that \"Reception is currently open 10am to 5pm, If you are arriving after reception hours, please contact us so we can email you self check-in details for late check-in.\" However, when I messaged them on the day of my check in to tell them I would arrive at 3pm (before reception was supposed to close), they responded that \"reception is operating on reduced hours, closing at 1pm\" which should have been communicated in the original email or as soon as the decision to close reception early had been made. One would think that, since they had known the date of my check in when sending the confirmation email, they would be able to see at that time whether or not reception was operating on normal hours or not BEFORE sending an email with incorrect info. During my two night stay, I never met a single employee or staff member of the hostel. It felt very impersonal and strange.\n\nOVERALL though, for what you pay, it's suitable and tolerable. Bedding and facilities seemed clean, which is a key detail for many. The location is a bit far from the main attractions in Brighton, but still less than a 20 minute walk. I would not stay here again, but I would not say that my preferences are a deal breaker for everyone.",

The bed was relatively comfortable and the room was spacious, but that’s where the pleasantries end.\n\nThe bad: Our first shock of the trip comes from when we entered the door, and we were made aware it was a hostel, not a hotel. There was extremely little advertising that this was not a hotel, and after looking at other reviews, this seems to be a common complaint. After this shock, we sat down in the lobby as we had arrived quite early (that’s not their fault to be fair). We asked roughly when the room would be ready and we were met with so much uncertainty we were worried we’d even booked the room. We then tried to check in after roughly 2 hours of waiting for the room to be ready, only to be met with surprise forms and ID checks. This is our first time travelling together, so this may be common place practice, yet the service was quite frankly rude and mean. We asked why we had to do this and we were met with a face being pulled and a very abrupt “Just do it.” After another hour of filling in forms, we finally arrived at our room, and in their favour, the room was initially quite good. It was spacious and the bed was comfy, yet then we entered the bathroom, and found that the bathtub was out of order, but more on that later. We then checked the shower, only to find that the shower head could not stay up on its own. After requesting a fix from the desk and waiting another two hours, our request was fixed, so props to them for that. Now, we had paid extra for breakfast and, if I’m honest, we were not pleased. The food was luke warm at best, and the general selection was just poor. A weird mix between a full English breakfast and a continental breakfast. This just irked us the wrong, and really cemented a 2/5 for us.\n\nThe ugly: Now, as mentioned before the bath was out of order, and after a quick glance inside, it was made apparent this was because of a mysterious substance that was inside the tub. I don’t know wether the cleaning staff didn’t want to or couldn’t get it out (I don’t know which is worse) but we had paid for a bathtub, and so we expected a bathtub. We will be enquiring as to a partial refund for this, as the room in total cost us ~£130 for the night. After doing some research ourselves, we found a travel lodge room for a family of 4 costing the same. And I bet they at-least had a working shower at time of check in.",

I felt the room was too cold so I tried to put on the heater or the radiator, but neither were working at the time. We had to message the company to ask for the heating to go on and they replied promptly  saying that the heating will automatically turn on for a few hours each evening, but we didn't notice it turn on whilst we were in the room. To access the hotel and rooms the company send 2 codes to enter the main door and another to release the key from the key-safe that is on the wall outside of the room which worked well.  I think each floor has its own communal bathroom. Annoyingly the communal room with shower/toilet on my floor was small. Overall it was an okay place to stay for a short time in my opinion and it's in a good location very close to Brighton Pier, and even closer to the famous Pavilion gardens and to the famous Brighton Lanes",

We booked a room that was seemingly decent in size but on arrival were placed on almost the top floor in a tiny room which my boyfriend had to duck his head to enter. Looked nothing like online photos. We were lucky enough to walk past the worker who helped us get in as we weren’t given the correct code. Sheets were clean but the floor was dusty and the place smelt of smoke and other substances. Huge gap under our door and could hear other people in their rooms. The floor was tilted and it felt like we were walking on a boat, like it was going to break. There were cigarette buts all below the window on the roof of the lower floor, and we couldn’t open our window as it was broken and held by a screw. It was humid and dusty, so hot. The worst part is that when we were home, we recieved an email that we were charged £20 for a stained towel but when checking out, we left the door open for cleaning, so feel like someone put their stained one in our room. There was no invoice for the charge and it was taken without notice or conversation. We yet have to deal with this. It is definitely worth spending a few hundred extra for a nice place, as it made the whole Brighton trip feel like a misery. We left as soon as we could and even considered sleeping in the car instead",

I booked a private room which was very clean and comfortable and the nearby shared facilities were well kept. The shower was great, hot and powerful and just what I needed after a long day of walking. I took advantage of the burger and beer offer in the cafe which was really good value for money and very tasty. Breakfast was plentiful with self service for continental options and the cooked breakfast made to order. All the staff I encountered were really helpful and friendly and from what I observed in their interaction with other  guests it seemed that nothing was too much trouble. Well done Truleigh Hill, you have inspired me to try youth hostelling again in the future 😊",

Still waiting for my £100.00 deposit to be returned 17 days tomorrow. How they take a deposit for that place is beyond me, you can’t possibly make that place any worse. Shower had no door just a curtain. We had a half used wet toilet roll left for us. We couldn’t even find hand soap! Which is absolutely just appalling. The beds were stained mattresses with a plastic sheet over. I genuinely couldn’t believe my eyes. We had no heating, all the walls and skirting are cracked chipped and terrible with paint slapped over it. We had dirty mugs in our room, half the plug sockets didn’t work, our door had definitely at some point been kicked as you could see a huge chunk of the wood missing in the lock of the frame. This is the first hotel I’ve ever stayed in where I haven’t wanted to take my shoes off.\n\nBut that’s not all. When I complained I got sent pictures to say it was similar and in fact they had not been misleading with the pictures. Laughable well, I’ve uploaded the pictures so you be the judge of that.

The rooms were nothing like in the pictures small and quite dirty. we upgraded our room to have an ensuite, room 24 to be specific.The smell as you walked into the room was disturbing. even worse when you opened the bathroom door. The toilet didn’t flush properly, shower smell disgusting and water was dirty when we turned it on. we didn’t think it worth the price at all. not happy with our stay.",

Nowhere to charge phones, even had to take our own rubbish home with us (instructed to by the proprietor) as they didn't have the facilities to dispose of it on site. We were pretty much completely self-sufficient for the whole weekend. The breakfast roll on Saturday was delivered along with tea, coffee, and orange juice. It was hot and tasty but was extremely overpriced at £7 per-head. The showers were no-frills, functional, but relatively decent. However I still say you are better off paying less and taking your own tent along with phone charging capability. It's cheaper and you know what you're getting. £140 each for 2 nights is an extortionate price for effectively just letting people sleep in a field you own. Will never be going back.",

It was hot and tasty but was extremely overpriced at £7 per-head. The showers were no-frills, functional, but relatively decent. However I still say you are better off paying less and taking your own tent along with phone charging capability. It's cheaper and you know what you're getting. £140 each for 2 nights is an extortionate price for effectively just letting people sleep in a field you own. Will never be going back.",

There are only 6 toilets and showers for women and the same for men. This is a huge site which caters for caravans, camper vans, motor homes and tents and there are just not enough toilet/showers for the numbers who are on site at any one time. The  standard of cleanliness was very poor too, very disappointing as it was more than £50 per night for our serviced pitch and for that kind of money you expect a higher standard.",

The swimming pool is a comfortable size for proper laps, and the water was pleasantly warm. The sauna and steam room were both clean, relaxing, and exactly what you want after a long day — a proper little escape.\n\nOverall, the facilities are well looked after and offer good value.

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice and clean this hotel was for it being an \"old\" hotel. Our room was clean, bright and spacious with a lovely seaview and huge balcony. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. My son was even comfortable on the pull out bed which can be hit-or-miss in some hotels. The bathroom was a little odd-the layout was strange and the shower was tiny for how big the room and bathroom were. It also didn't have a very luxurious feel to it, although it was fine.\nThe location was perfect for us for walking around to the pier, shops, and restaurants we wanted to go to. We were impressed by the lobby and hallways with the tall ceilings and chandeliers and giant staircase. We really felt like we were in a fancy historic hotel. We enjoyed skipping the lift and walking up and down the main staircase instead. Breakfast was decent, nothing spectacular although the dining room was very grand and pretty. We checked out the pool and gym. Although it seemed great and fully equipped with everything we may have wanted to use, we ultimately did not choose to use it because it felt a little stuffy being down in the basement level. Overall a great experience and would stay here again if we want a seaside escape from London!",

It also didn't have a very luxurious feel to it, although it was fine.\nThe location was perfect for us for walking around to the pier, shops, and restaurants we wanted to go to. We were impressed by the lobby and hallways with the tall ceilings and chandeliers and giant staircase. We really felt like we were in a fancy historic hotel. We enjoyed skipping the lift and walking up and down the main staircase instead. Breakfast was decent, nothing spectacular although the dining room was very grand and pretty. We checked out the pool and gym. Although it seemed great and fully equipped with everything we may have wanted to use, we ultimately did not choose to use it because it felt a little stuffy being down in the basement level. Overall a great experience and would stay here again if we want a seaside escape from London!",

Replacing the old machines with new and modern ones is on the plus side and their maintenance is better. However, all the cardio machines - treadmills, bikes, rowers, elliptical machines are now jammed in a small narrow space with poor or no air conditioning. You walk in from the air-conditioned corridor and are hit by warm and stuffy air and a stink of sweat. Now there is no air conditioning in the whole gym.\nChanging rooms. New showers in the pool changing room and a new coat of paint (already peeling off at places though) in the dry changing - good. However, since the wet changing was closed for refurbishment, the dry changing room is a mess: rubbish and pools of water on the floor everywhere and the toilets are often disgusting. The reaction of one of the ladies at the reception was: “But now people come there from the pool to change!”, implying What do you expect? Well, exactly because of that and because MORE people use the showers and toilets, anyone would expect the staff to mop the floor and clean the toilets MORE often. Also, the hand and hair dryers didn’t work last Monday.\nPool. For years before MORE has taken over, the midday lane swimming was available at set times without any problems. Now, nothing is certain, they change the timetable from day to day and from week to week or cancel the sessions altogether in favour of other activities or for unknown reasons. The staff argue that there are morning and evening sessions. Yes, but not everyone is able to do vigorous exercise early in the morning or close to bedtime, and there are people who can only come at their lunch breaks. Besides, it will be dark in the evenings and mornings soon and some people, especially elderly or disabled, may be unable or reluctant to walk or drive to the centre in the darkness.\nOverall, the centre has the lowest rating of all the public leisure facilities managed by MORE in Oxford. Is it something that should be taken with the city council? Some of the problems, not all though, may be due to the current refurbishment situation, but we are paying the same membership fees while the conditions and services have substantially deteriorated, and the refurbishment is planned for a few more months.",

From the start, the service was far below expectations, and I encountered several issues that have left a very negative impression of the facility.\n\nOne of the most upsetting experiences occurred when my partner and I arrived late—around 10 to 15 minutes—for an aqua class. We were eager to join the class, but when we approached the swimming pool, the coach refused to let us in. Instead of explaining the policy or offering a helpful solution, the coach spoke to us in a rude and dismissive manner. This was not only unprofessional but completely unnecessary. Since that incident, we have not returned to the gym. We even made an effort to give it another chance by trying to use the swimming pool again, but we left almost immediately due to the negative atmosphere.\n\nThe overall environment at the gym felt unwelcoming, with staff attitudes that lacked basic courtesy. The customer service is absolutely terrible, and the gym itself isn’t as clean as it should be. We have been so put off by the experience that we tried calling them on the 21st of this month to cancel our membership as we are not going anyway. However, we were told that we had to give a one-month notice period and that we would still be charged for the next month. This feels incredibly unfair, especially since we have no intention of ever returning. I’ve never experienced such poor service in my life, and it’s frustrating to know they will take our money for a service we don’t want.\n\nIn all my years of using gyms in London and Oxfordshire, I have never encountered such a negative experience. I would not recommend Barton Leisure Centre to anyone based on my experience, and I hope this feedback encourages them to improve their customer service and cleanliness.\nPS: I should’ve checked the ratings and read the reviews before signing up for the membership. If I had, I would have avoided this frustrating experience altogether.",

Today in the women's changing rooms I watched a receptionist use the bathroom and return to the front desk without washing her hands.\n\nI genuinely can't believe the university lets this place operate in this condition. The price you pay for what you get is extortionate. I'm gutted that this is the only gym within cycling distance of my house.\n\nThe only upside is the personal trainer, Paul, who is always cheerful and happy for a chat.",

Their skin is turning purple after half an hour despite lots of splashing about and we struggle to stay the full hour. On the other hand the showers are then scalding hot so we also can't stand under them for long as it's unpleasant.\nNot sure what has happened to the management of the pool area recently, it doesn't seem like anyone is checking the temperatures.",

The changing rooms were awful like no one has cleaned it in weeks the nappy bins were over flowing. Disgusting.

The general standard of the facilities is good (in particular, I like the 8 e-gym machines, which are accessed by logging in with an app that tracks your progress and remembers the settings for each machine). At about £380 for a year's membership I also think it's pretty good value for money.\n\nHowever, the centre as a whole is badly let down by its management, which is completely unresponsive to complaints about items requiring maintenance or repair. This includes such vital items as the air conditioning in the gym, half of which has been inoperative for about a month. What started off as minor annoyances have therefore become major frustrations as repeated reminders of even such small issues as a loose toilet seat which would only take about 3 minutes with a spanner to fix are persistently ignored. Three separate individuals at the reception desk told me they would sort that problem out themselves, and all of them broke their undertaking.\n\nOther things that could be improved are the lack of air conditioning in corridors and changing rooms, and the fact that there is only one urinal plus one toilet cubicle in the men's dry changing room. I also dislike the fact that music I have not chosen is often being pumped out over the gym's PA system instead of having silence. Half the users are trying to listen to their own headphones while exercising, and it must surely be a nuisance to them too to have to try to mentally shut out the noise from the PA system.\n\nI haven't yet used the pool (25 metres, wide lanes), but it looks to be in excellent condition.\n\nThe pool's shower area is unisex and lacks privacy for both showing and changing.\n\nThe men's dry changing room also has showers, but the fact that swimmers who have exited the pool would need to use the showers in the men's dry changing room if they wanted to shower without their costumes on strikes me as pretty awkward. I assume that female swimmers would face a similar problem.\n\nIt is the poor management of the leisure centre that induces me to give the facility only two stars, otherwise I would have given it four stars. An upgrade of the changing and toilet facilities would be required for me to give it five stars.",

This was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had at any leisure facility — not only in Oxford, but anywhere.\n\nFirst of all, there are NO clear signs or verbal warnings at the reception informing guests about the strict and frankly ridiculous rules: no drinking (not even a light, low-alcohol beverage), no eating, no jumping, no swimming unless someone gives you some kind of unspoken green light. Apparently, you’re expected to be psychic.\n\nMy friend had a mild alcoholic drink — we’re talking about something barely stronger than juice — and the moment we were told it wasn’t allowed (for the first time, mind you!), she respectfully and immediately put it away. No attitude, no argument. But somehow, that wasn’t good enough. Instead of a polite reminder or even a written notice, we were treated like criminals.\n\nAnd then, as if that wasn’t enough — we weren’t even allowed to swim. Yes, you heard that right. Despite paying for the time slot, for the sun loungers, and for the access, we never got to enjoy the pool. The moment I stepped into the water, an ALARM was triggered. A literal siren. Staff came rushing over and actually threatened to call the police. It was humiliating, aggressive, and completely disproportionate.\n\nWhat kind of hospitality is that? You sell people a service and then punish them for using it?\n\nThere was no kindness, no understanding, and absolutely no customer service. Just cold faces, zero communication, and unnecessary drama.\n\nWe paid full price for what ended up being a deeply unpleasant, hostile encounter. No swimming. No relaxation. Just rules that nobody bothered to explain, and treatment that made us feel like criminals for simply existing.\n\nSave your money. Save your dignity. Go literally anywhere else in Oxford. This place is a joke — and not a funny one.\n\nI can understand everything, but no one warned me personally that you can't drink. There are no signs. And my friend immediately cleaned everything up after the first remark. To tell the truth, I realized that the employee of this complex simply EXCEEDS all authority!!! They have no right to turn on the siren and kick you out of the pool. If you have any strict rules! Write down who and talk about it before you sell tickets and sun loungers!\n\na Recommendations and Not Rules!!! Talking in advance or about alternatives, for example, you can go swimming in an hour!",

Parking nearby is free after 6pm (you still have to enter your reg and get a ticket) and then a short walk over the bridge to the pool. Male/female changing rooms with toilets, hot indoor showers, and lockers (£1 refundable, get a band for the locker key from reception). It was the end of a long, hot day so the changing rooms were a bit dirty/smelly, but I could forgive this as the pool was an absolute dream. Heated to around 28°, immaculately clean, well organised lane swim which wasn't crowded. Pool regulars and staff were friendly too. I'll be stopping off here again - thanks for a relaxing swim in a lush pool 🙏",

          "reviewText": "This pool is a little gem! Booked via the Better app for an evening lane swim. At £6.80 this was good value for money. Parking nearby is free after 6pm (you still have to enter your reg and get a ticket) and then a short walk over the bridge to the pool. Male/female changing rooms with toilets, hot indoor showers, and lockers (£1 refundable, get a band for the locker key from reception). It was the end of a long, hot day so the changing rooms were a bit dirty/smelly, but I could forgive this as the pool was an absolute dream. Heated to around 28°, immaculately clean, well organised lane swim which wasn't crowded. Pool regulars and staff were friendly too. I'll be stopping off here again - thanks for a relaxing swim in a lush pool 🙏",

Too many people for the size of the pool, which is quite small, so constantly bumping into other swimmers. Every 10 min the life guard blows a whistle to yell which bracelet colour should leave the pool. And it's expensive too, £6.80 for 50 min.",

My daughter was very confused and uncomfortable as neither of us knew where to look!\nI mentioned it to the members of staff ( 2 young women) and they did not seem bothered at all. I just put it down to a weird experience and went back into the pool with my daughter. When we had got showered and got changed (in a cubicle, I might add!) we saw another lady in the shower naked, washing herself. I told my daughter to look away again as it's just so inappropriate for the lady to be doing this. I then went and spoke to the members of staff at reception again, and again they did not seem bothered nor willing to want to talk about it, they actually turned away from me and went round the corner of their reception where I couldn't see, while a male member of staff spoke to me. He said in the morning and evening adult only sessions then they allow it but it shouldn't be happening when there are children about and he would put a sign up. He basically  insinuated there wasn't anything else he could do about it as it would mean entering the ladies changing room, my answer to that would be to send a female member of staff in then! If only to just say could the ladies use a cubicle or shower in their bathing suit during the times when children are about!\nI'm just appalled that this is basically accepted infront of children! The staff didn't seem to care and clearly the ladies deem it okay to appear naked infront of children. I don't feel comfortable bringing my child back here again if this is what I can expect. Such a shame as the pool is lovely. Just too disturbing and inappropriate in the changing room for children.",

However, things have taken a nosedive since then, and I've had to make the tough decision to cancel my membership and find another gym. Let me break down why.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the changing rooms and toilets for men. It's honestly a nightmare in there. The smell hits you the moment you walk in, and there's just no escaping it. It's like there's zero ventilation. The floors are always wet, the sinks are busted, the soap dispensers are always empty, and don't even get me started on the mess – it's like nobody ever bothers to clean up after themselves. Plus, half the lockers are busted or missing doors, which is just inconvenient and makes you worry about the security of your stuff.\n\nI want to give credit where it's due – the staff are really friendly and helpful. They're always there to lend a hand or offer advice. But unfortunately, their positive attitude can't make up for the fact that the gym itself feels like it's falling apart. The equipment is getting old and worn out, and it seems like nobody's bothering to maintain it properly.\n\nSo, as much as I hate to say it, JD Gym just isn't cutting it for me anymore.

People regularly leave weights lying around instead of putting them back—expecting someone new or less strong to unload multiple 25 kg plates from a barbell or leg press is unreasonable.\n\nDumbbells are often left scattered on the floor near benches, creating obvious trip hazards. If someone were to fall or injure themselves because of this, it could easily lead to legal action. Safety should be taken seriously. If someone is strong enough to lift the weights to use them, there’s no excuse for not racking them properly afterward.\n\nI also can’t stand how some people have no respect for personal space or hygiene—including groups of students and Uber drivers who seem more interested in staring at women than actually training.\n\nI understand people need to rest between sets, but it’s frustrating when they take 10 minutes just staring at their phones or having long conversations, with no regard for others waiting to use the machine.\n\nOn top of that, some of the equipment is badly in need of maintenance or replacement. For example, one of the calf raise machines feels like the bearings are shot, and the loading pole on the leg press is so angled it looks like the plates could fall off at any moment.\n\nOverall, the entire branch feels neglected and seems to be relying solely on the JD Gyms name to keep attracting members.

Also some members just hog the equipment when it can be shared between sets.\nPlenty of lockers available but just 2 urinals and 2 toilets.\nI suggest management should invest in more frequent cleaning and maybe some sort of air freshener equipment around the locker room and the main entrance.",

The green frontage and small water feature give it a relaxed, open feel—nice to unwind for a few minutes before getting back on the road.\n\nOverall, this service area is a clean, comfortable, and well-equipped stop for anyone driving along the M40. Whether you’re recharging your car or yourself, it’s a sound choice with everything you might need. Just plan a bit of extra time if you’re depending on EV chargers or particular restaurants during rush hours.",

The place is clean, bright, and even has a free piano you can tinkle on while taking a break. The food court offers something for every craving: KFC, Burger King, Subway, Chopstix, and the bright The Good Breakfast breakfast bar (step‑free access and all – ideal for stretching your legs)  . If you're in the mood for coffee, there’s both a Starbucks inside and a separate Drive‑Thru, plus a Taco Bell that opened in March 2025. And for a slightly more upscale sit‑down, there’s a PizzaExpress and a good-sized Waitrose & Partners for everything from grab‑and‑go sandwiches to snacks  . Between those options and WHSmith, Krispy Kreme, and the petrol forecourts, it really does feel like a small food village on the motorway.\n\nFrom my point of view, it’s one of the best service‑station experiences on the M40. You’ve got the classics—KFC, McWhopper‑style flame‑grill from Burger King, Subway subs—plus hot‑food diversity with Chopstix noodles and Taco Bell’s new menu. I particularly enjoyed the sit‑down at PizzaExpress; it felt like a proper break rather than just refuelling. The two hours free parking, clean baby‑change areas, EV chargers, showers, and a Ramada hotel on‑site make it practical for any kind of stop—whether it’s a quick food run or a short-freshen‑up break. I’ll definitely be adding this to my travel rota—I’d rather stop here than settle for a rushed snack at a less appealing service station.",

          "reviewText": "Wow! Onroute Truckstops have been very busy at Swindon! What an amazing difference! My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.  Signage to parking was clear and concise, and there was ample space available.  Traffic flow was moderate and free.\n\nFirst engagement was the canteen, by which entry was via a newly developed entrance.  Stunning.  New groundwork’s was colourful and very pleasing to the eye.  There were new picnic tables positioned outside - and were being used.  New plants were positioned, giving the homely welcome.  A huge effort has been made to greet customers to this area and the transformation from the old side entrance is worlds apart.  There are new big screens displaying menus, new information points, leaflets, all safety measures present, serviceable, in date and correctly placed where applicable.\n\nI met ‘Claire’ behind the counter, who was welcoming, bright and bubbly and just what you need to lift your spirits from the drama and stress of the highways. Also in attendance were approximately 4 other staff and the whole food counter experience was top class.  A very nice touch was a bowl of free healthy fruit for visitors. Well done there.  Food service was very quick - top marks.\n\nThe canteen was spotless. There were plenty of customers throughout the day (I was there for a 24hr stop) and I watched with interest the positive energy this team had going on. Everyone was greeted with a welcome and a smile.  No name badges though, I’d like to have seen that - it’s a more personal presentation to thank someone and show appreciation by referring to them by name. It’s also awkward to have to ask, maybe this should be considered. On the opposite side of the coin it equally encourages staff to deliver excellence as it’s much easier to identify individual failings. Certainly not the case here today however.\n\nNo sooner had a diner finished a staff member was instantly on hand to clean and disinfect and prepare the space for the next customer.  There was also excellent promotion and encouragement by the staff to download and use the Onroute app.\n\nFeedback: drivers are still struggling to find the SNAP terminals to pay for parking and are constantly having to queue and ask at the counter, disrupting staff from the catering flow.  The terminals hidden away in the toilet corridor and are not signed. A staff member had put a handwritten sign on the access door to highlight the location but was told by management to take it down. This was a poor decision and negatively impacted good staff initiative.  It may not have been ideal or as professional as a custom branded sign, but it was better than nothing!  There is still no clear signage to the SNAP payment terminals and needs addressed for full score achievement.\n\nThe shop was well stocked and inviting. It’s bright and has most of the essentials needed for drivers. As soon as I approached the shop a member of staff was there to assist if needed. I made several purchases and the whole experience again was very good.\n\nThe toilet corridor from the canteen leads to access snap terminals, ladies, gents and disabled toilets, and showers.  It was clean, fresh, clear of debris; and both snap terminals were fully functional. All fire safety measures were present, in date and clearly identified.  Health & Safety measures were also in place and being used effectively.\n\nUnfortunately I can’t give any further details as I’ve run out of characters! Happy to be contacted if necessary. Staff deserve special credit for a near perfect experience. Well done. Very well done.",

It's now a very small space in which the drivers eat compared to previously. Showers and toilets get the thumbs up though. I've eaten better food for less money. Next time I'll go to Sainsbury's next door and just buy something from there, it will be tastier than what I had. Do something about that soup, it's really bad, it was the vegetable soup and it was like someone just decided it would be best to use the old vegetables up by making a soup. The chef can't be happy, or doesn't have a tasting spoon. A dreary 1 star. Overall the old place was better for space. It feels cramped with 10 people in there",

No respect of privacy, I was let into another person’s room to use their en-suite by the staff without any consent from the guests. Location was not what it was promised. The owners are cheating people out of their money in a gross abuse of the insane accom prices in Oxford during the summer. Bed not uncomfortable but about to fall apart whenever I moved during the night. Would not enter room or shower without shoes on. Whatever level of dirty you imagine, it’s way way worse. Worth it to pay a little more to keep your dignity. This review is not to punish the owner as I am sure they will not be bothered by another bad review.

Showers need a £1 coin but it’s hot and plenty long enough. Helpful reception and warm welcome. Eynsham is a short bus ride or countryside walk along the Thames and has nice pubs and classic Oxfordshire village vibes.",

Showers were electronic and water flow was timed.  This wasn't a problem as the control sensors were easy to use.\nLocation was excellent with a short stroll into the town or the Thames walk.

The website still advertises, whether on their site location, facilities or gallery that they have a bar, a play park a pool table and football table in the 'games room'. They have none of these! (there is a 'games room') PLEASE FULLY UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE!\n- a large amount of people appear to be living on site (site workers etc with families), I've no problem with that, they we nice friendly people, however I felt like we were living in there home as it were. They left wet washing from the washing machines on the washing up draining boards, a sponge and razor behind the pipes of the shower, and left for work really early (the campsite is covered in thick gravel which is very noisy, especially at 7:30am).\n- the campsite is very tired. Nothing seems to get fixed when broken. Spinning taps in the toilet block, broken soap dispensers, cracked plug socket in the laundry room are just a few examples. The 'games room' never got tidied or cleaned, with beer cans filling the bin. There was a dartboard in there, but the workmen who live on site seem to use this so we didn't get a chance to have a game. The site just had a general unkempt feel, with bits of detritus left lying around.\n- the road noise is very loud, which kicks in at around 6:30am.\n- not the site's fault, but there's hardly any phone signal (we're on O2 no idea on other providers) and their free WiFi didn't reach our pitch. Again, not the site's fault, just a niggle.\n- not the site's fault.again, but the only pub within walking distance is permanently closed.\nWe booked our stay on incorrect information, which is the most frustrating thing of all. We have stayed on nicer sites for less.",

Again, not the site's fault, just a niggle.\n- not the site's fault.again, but the only pub within walking distance is permanently closed.\nWe booked our stay on incorrect information, which is the most frustrating thing of all. We have stayed on nicer sites for less.",

Also the games room/shed is no more. It’s also housed to people that seem to be living on site working community!  Coming and going all day.   It’s just not a campsite anymore, my son (5) hit in the neck no reason and my daughter (8) had a rock thrown at her knee. Sorry but no thanks. 2 night weekend was cut short and we left first thing next morning, the site manager is lovely and does all she can to accommodate sadly new owners means it’s all out of her hands.",

Watching them enjoy the water so freely was a joy in itself.\n\nWarm Hospitality\nThe owners were absolutely lovely—friendly, helpful, and genuinely welcoming. They made us feel right at home and added a personal touch that made all the difference.\n\nCaptured Moments\nWe took some amazing videos and photos that we've already shared with extended family, who were seriously impressed.

The pretty village of Sutton Courtenay is a 10-minute walk away where you can find a few nice pubs and visit George Orwell's grave. Abingdon is a historic town that's worth a visit and is 10-minute drive away. There are also lots of walks along the Thames within easy distance. My friend and I had a very relaxing stay and will probably return again in the future. Highly recommend if you're looking for a reasonably priced glamping holiday",

The site has 4 large bell tents, clean inside and out, and offer all of the amenities you'd need. There's no grid electricity or plumbing but Stephen and Annemarie have considered all aspects. There's lockboxes to charge devices via solar panels, fridge freezers, amazing outdoor showers which are the perfect temperature and heaters inside the tents should you need. Each pitch has a BBQ, fire pit and picnic bench. The standout part of our stay was the wood fired hot tub which was expertly set up by our hosts to a perfect temperature, the hot tub is located in a private area opposite the river and you're shielded by lots of trees and river plants. The hot tub was a welcomed treat after a long day of walking. Our hosts made us feel incredibly welcomed and we really cannot wait to return. Thank you Stephen and Annemarie.",

Always had to go into 5 toilets before you found a cleanish one to use. Showers only stay on for 5 seconds and designed for people under 5’. As soon as we got there Thursday there was clearly a situation with the toilets and lack of drainage. The showers were not draining and nothing was done until it flooded on the Saturday and all toilets/showers out of order. They should have done something about it sooner!  No compensation offered and they didn’t have anything to say to us when we said about the lack of cleanliness. Kids are allowed to scream and parents are obnoxious. I had to keep my dog on a lead and quiet, so why is it any different for people’s rude kids. Won’t be coming back, so disappointed with this campsite.",

It even had two toilets, which was surprisingly convenient. The bathroom featured a modern setup with both rain and handheld shower heads, excellent water pressure, and precise temperature control. Everything about the room felt carefully considered and of high quality. Complimentary snacks and drinks were provided, the room was spotless, and the cleaning staff were consistently warm and friendly.\n\nThe Service:\nService throughout our stay was fantastic. While the team seemed small — often just one or two receptionists — they were exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to help. They assisted with dinner reservations and even offered complimentary rides within the property.\n\nThe Food:\nBreakfast was classic English fare, served in a lovely setting with attentive and cheerful staff.\n\nThe Spa:\nThough on the smaller side, the spa is very well equipped — featuring a steam room, sauna, warm and tropical showers, and even a snow machine! It’s compact but thoughtfully designed and never felt overcrowded.\n\nThe Grounds:\nBeautifully maintained, with complimentary electric vehicle parking available.\n\nMinor Notes:\nThere’s no elevator, and we arrived with heavy suitcases that had to be carried up the stairs. There weren’t any male staff around at the time, so I felt a bit bad watching the female staff struggle to help us with the luggage — but they were gracious and insisted nonetheless.",

Sadly the spa is far too busy and given the age of the hotel, rooms are really not soundproof in the slightest, you can hear next door rooms and doors opening along the corridor etc.\nThe booking was for a birthday which was told beforehand to the hotel, at check in it was mentioned a ‘sweet treat’ would be waiting in the room as a gesture. Unfortunately there was nothing, was not recognised by the person showing us the room, nor was it rectified at any point during our stay.\nThere are no fridges in the rooms but communal Smeg fridge in the corridor with unlimited water/milk available.\nThe rainfall shower was outstanding.\nEnded up ordering room service for dinner (but had to run down to find someone each time we did as the phones were never answered) due to there being no tables available at the time we were wanting to dine, but the food was delicious. Drinks arrived in good time, food felt slow.\nWhen watching tv, someone trying to connect to airplay would continuously interrupt us watching tv as it would try and connect our tv and turn off what we were watching. Which was obviously rather annoying.\nNo turndown service offered on check in or any camomile tea in the room. Only last three teas available when asking reception. No offer to get any more.\nThe bed in the room we were in (Room 11), was not made for anyone around 6’0”, unless you’re happy with feet dangling off the bed. Not mentioned on booking. But super comfortable bed and bedding.\nBreakfast the next morning was incredibly slow service for hot food, verging on painful and the cold buffet selection was pretty average.\nShame the spa was so busy, it would be good if you were able to book onto an allotted time, so it doesn’t get hogged.\nThoughtful gift bag when checking out/leaving. Glad to have stayed, but not sure I would again. Nothing particularly outstanding that blew me away.",

They could easily do it at reception, but the staff are so arrogant and unhelpful, they’d rather argue than assist.\n4.\tShower heads barely work, some don’t run at all — disgusting after a workout.\n5.\tSteam room? Out of order for months, with no explanation or compensation.\n6.\tThe floors are slimy, covered in fungus and grime, making it feel more like a neglected public toilet than a premium facility.\n7.\tConstant lifeguard shortage, raising serious safety concerns, especially with so many kids around.\n\nThis place is falling apart — a complete rip-off. I deeply regret purchasing an annual membership here. Whoever is managing this facility should be ashamed. Avoid at all costs unless you want to pay to be disgusted.",

She's been attending for a long time now, each term they check their progress, give certificates and email some feedback. The children progress classes as their skills improve. I like the swimming pool as there is always parking on site, and there's a little playground and cafe If children want to play before or after their lesson. The best thing in my opinion is their online booking system. You are able to cancel lessons you cannot attend, and they give you a virtual token and you can book another lesson to cover the one they lost. I find this useful and it means we never waste a lesson. Children members can also book public swims free of charge, however adults that accompany need to pay. The pool is large, and clean. The temperature is okay. The only con is the female changing rooms, as at times they can be wet and messy. They could do with more regular checking and cleaning and free hair dryer. Other than that I certainly recommend this pool, especially for children's lessons.",

We could use the pool for one hour and have a maximum of 30 people in the water but one adult for every 2 under 8.  Our party was only 10 children and 3 adults in the water and this gave the children loads of space to play. The centre provided floats, noodles, sinkers and balls to make the party really fun. You can also hire a room for your own food after, at an extra (but reasonable) cost. The pool was well maintained and looked after and the lifeguards were doing a great job too. changing facilities were clean and showers worked well.",

Even though we thought it was a little unfair we stopped using them and moved on. Later we decided to get out the pool and dry off and we decided to use the hairdryers that are available there that we usually use every time we get out the pool however this time we was prompted by the same staff member that we cannot use them and we need to bring a towel even though we have never been asked to not use the hairdryer before. Again we thought this was strange but we listened and stopped using them but soon after we got changed we saw a lady also using the hair dryer who was using it completely unbothered and we felt a bit targeted and believe it was unfair as we never have had that issue before.",

Its pretty obvious whoever is supposed to be cleaning them isnt doing their job at all. I took my 1 year old and couldnt even put her on the floor while I got myself changed it was so disgusting. The change table could do with having safety straps as I couldn't keep her safely still while I changed her and myself and I had to keep her up on the change table because of the state of the floor. If anyone is planning to go I would wear socks if you dont want warts, verrucas, athletes foot and god knows what else could be lurking on that floor!

Everything is very clean, from the workout areas to the locker rooms, which makes for a much more enjoyable gym experience. It's clear the team takes pride in maintaining high standards.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the restaurant - the food is delicious and offers great healthy options that complement my fitness routine perfectly. It's convenient to grab a quality meal without having to leave the premises.\n\nOverall, I am pleased to be part of this gym community. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a clean, well-run facility with staff who genuinely care about their members!",

The phone app is helpful, and can track things like your time at the gym, or how many people are at the gym (so you know when its quiet). The machines seem decent to me (I have no comparison) and have different workout options or manual. The bathroom is clean every time, however there's no hairdryer, if you plan on showering there. The thing that annoys me is that there could be more weight machines, as a lot of the time they are taken up by someone else (though sometimes it feels like they're just sat there). Theres plenty of options of free weights, boxing and ropes too, if that's your thing. The lockers are okay, kinda annoying if you dont have a lock, or yours doesnt fit, however they have a vending machine, and you can buy one for £5. The machines and gym are cleaned by staff, very decently I must say. I've recommend this gym to my friends, and now to everyone.",

Effort in the little things such as Hex clamps, fixed EZ bars, amount of clamps to use, & organised weights. Staff very friendly & helpful. Only criticisms being the cable attachments were a bit worn out and absence of temp control in the showers, but minor, as the bathroom/changing facilities were immaculate & good quality. Overall positive experience, quiet & clean gym 8.5/10. Will definitely visit again.",

Helen was really friendly and understood the reason I had for joining the gym and what I needed from David Lloyd to make this happen regarding childcare. I would recommend booking a tour as there is potential discounts that are being run which are only available when you enquire directly. All staff were really friendly and approachable including the reception staff and also the manager Kev who had a quick 10 mins to talk to us and also explain the introduction of the e-gym later in the year. I was really happy with the service and I look forward to being able to enjoy the facilities at West End.",

It would make more sense to pay extra for it if someone wouldn't be on a monthly plan.\nCosta would also benefit a bit more from it as parents socialise and for example \"hey let's grab a coffee and catch up\" or the kids burning their energy and then ask for snacks which would be a \"win-win\" for all parties. I've mentioned this in the reception but all I was told was \"it's a different company\"...\n\nI hope Mr Ian sees this review and actually consider giving access to those who have an active monthly plan for their kids at least. Even if it's indeed different companies.... both would only benefit from kids who have classes playing freely right?\n\nOn top of this, it would be nice to see the cleaning standards improved since the prices have increased; the floor in the changing rooms is usually pretty messy and perhaps add a couple of extra family changing cubicles?!",

Lots of seating dotted around for spectators.\n\nParking is sometimes busy so leave plenty of time.\n\nWe did the 11am-12.50 session followed by a drive in to the new Forest for a picnic after, making for a good family day out.\n\nAdults can spectate for £2.50 or swim in the separate section for just £4.50… or of course take part.\n\nSpecial mention to staff today who were fab and super informative.  We were greeted by a lifeguard who gave us a rundown of the rules and safety info which was much appreciated.  Also everyone has to wear a buoyancy aid, which is provided.",

Lots of seating dotted around for spectators.\n\nParking is sometimes busy so leave plenty of time.\n\nWe did the 11am-12.50 session followed by a drive in to the new Forest for a picnic after, making for a good family day out.\n\nAdults can spectate for £2.50 or swim in the separate section for just £4.50… or of course take part.\n\nSpecial mention to staff today who were fab and super informative.  We were greeted by a lifeguard who gave us a rundown of the rules and safety info which was much appreciated.  Also everyone has to wear a buoyancy aid, which is provided.",

Wet suits were advised even in summer but not too bad without. Private cubicle changing rooms available, and showers for after. Great chips at cafe.\nHuge variety and amounts of inflatable obsticles and runs to choose from, and the 2 hour session is so much better than other water parks I've been to.",

Unfortunately for us, our experience was not in line with the photos provided.  The room was extremely small and dated. For the price paid per night £106 we felt this was very overpriced.  The bed was fine for sleeping, but again, for the price I expected better.  The bathroom looked renovated but was very small and closet like.  The shower pressure was decent, but there was no light above the shower, which created a dark area.  The window in our room was broken, and I'm not saying it wouldn't open. It was literally smashed. It's not very appealing to look at.  The front hallway/stair area had a smell of urine (stale cat pee) again, not appealing.  Finally, the worst thing we experienced was the ridiculous noise coming from the lower street bars and clubs.  They messaged us prior and said there was \"possible nightlife noise.\" This was an understatement.   We could hear the music loud and clear even with the windows closed.  This went on until at least midnight.  As the night went on, the vibration from the bass was so intense that it shook the room.\n\nThe entry instructions for the room were detailed on WhatsApp.  The owners advise on the message to not hesitate to call or message if there are any issues.  We messaged 4 times (10 pm last night) with video evidence of the noise, but we still have not received a response (nor have they read these messages).\n\nThe only positive thing we will say is that the location to the city is great. It is within 5-10 minute walk to the town center and cruise ports.  Which is what we wanted.  The issues above, though, trump the location.\n\nIn conclusion, we will never return to this location, nor would we recommend staying here.  Find anything else in Southampton.",

The shower pressure was decent, but there was no light above the shower, which created a dark area.  The window in our room was broken, and I'm not saying it wouldn't open. It was literally smashed. It's not very appealing to look at.  The front hallway/stair area had a smell of urine (stale cat pee) again, not appealing.  Finally, the worst thing we experienced was the ridiculous noise coming from the lower street bars and clubs.  They messaged us prior and said there was \"possible nightlife noise.\" This was an understatement.   We could hear the music loud and clear even with the windows closed.  This went on until at least midnight.  As the night went on, the vibration from the bass was so intense that it shook the room.\n\nThe entry instructions for the room were detailed on WhatsApp.  The owners advise on the message to not hesitate to call or message if there are any issues.  We messaged 4 times (10 pm last night) with video evidence of the noise, but we still have not received a response (nor have they read these messages).\n\nThe only positive thing we will say is that the location to the city is great. It is within 5-10 minute walk to the town center and cruise ports.  Which is what we wanted.  The issues above, though, trump the location.\n\nIn conclusion, we will never return to this location, nor would we recommend staying here.  Find anything else in Southampton.",

Bath towels but no hand towels. No USB outlets or outlets by the bed. If you can live without these things, then this is a great deal. The place is clean and modern and well maintained. Nice firm bed. Housekeeping does a great job here. There were no issues with the room. The location is optimal for the Horizon cruise terminal across the street, and a 10-minute walk. However, it's further away for the other ones. Still, it's only a 20-minute walk to the Ocean cruise terminal. No breakfast included unless you've paid for it. However, there is a microwave. Coffee is extra in the eating kitchen area. The common lounge/ dining area seems to be open all the time. Staff are friendly, helpful, and accommodating, especially if you're just as nice to them. The location is actually great considering it's an easy walk from the bus depot, central train station, and the cruise ship terminals. The main downside I would say is the noisy McDonald's ventilation system just outside. You can't sleep with the window open and even with it closed you'll hear it.",

MDL went above and beyond to ensure I left happy and satisfied. It is a great park, small and quiet. Toilet and shower block are the best I've been too. The marina bar/restaurant is lovely, staff are friendly and great. Our grandson loves the cheesy garlic bread. Would highly recommend- if booking a caravan, double check your details of who's staying first! We did leave early, but only because one dog ended up at emergency vet, during the first few days we were told our landlord was selling our house and we had six weeks to move! And then my grandson choked on his bacon at the nearby cafe!! He's OK now! We just felt unable to relax! 😂",

The website also notes that campers have a 10 metre pitch so you don’t feel like you’re on top of each other - that’s not the case either.\nThis is a large field, and was full of families and groups. It’s a short walk to the sea, big open skies at night and the kids were having a wonderful time running around with flashing toys at night - I’m sure they all had a lovely time, but not a peaceful private escape to I’d hoped for. I’d suggest the website is updated to reflect that.\nIn 40 years of camping I have never been anywhere with so many signs and instructions. Ever 🤣\nCompostable toilets which reminded me of a festival block - stinky. Very basic showers - you wouldn’t want to touch anything.\nI can see the staff work hard and they were all polite and helpful. But there are many sites across the UK that have far more charm and offer better value for money. Not for me, sorry.",

Before we even had it set up, the male owner came over and told us we’d have to pay extra if we wanted to put it up.\n\nNow, I completely understand this rule when the site is busy, it’s fair if the gazebo takes up valuable space. But when the campsite is empty and we’re just trying to make the best of a miserable, wet weekend, it felt a bit money-grabbing. I’m sure the hundreds of other campers who didn’t show up that weekend didn’t get refunds, so the campsite wasn’t losing out.\n\nIt was disappointing after so many good stays, and it definitely left a sour taste this time.

The staff are friendly and helpful and the tents are comfortable and good in the rain. We have been twice and will book again.\n\nThe only thing that let's it down is the showers they aren't good go very very hot and then freezing and the pressure is awful and on our last visit there was no hot water from the taps in the ladies to wash.",

We took as recommended the number 66 bus (just a few minutes walk around the corner from the campsite) into Romsey which was a very pleasant town.  The White Horse Inn near to the campsite we can recommend for food with a nice interior or garden area.\n\nWe paid £70 for two nights.  The facilities were a little basic for the price, we did feel in comparison with other campsites.  The showers were annoyingly on 5 second timings and there was a distinct smell from perhaps the dirty mops /water bucket left out for patrons to clean behind themselves.\n\nOverall though we did enjoy our peaceful stay.

The space between pitches is huge, so despite having neighbours, we didn't feel at all overlooked or cramped. The site is tucked away from the main road, and although you can hear it sometimes, it's really not at all intrusive.\nThe toilet and shower block is great! Immaculate at all times of day and night, with plenty of hot water and two sinks for washing up dishes etc. The fridge freezer and phone charging point is a plus too.\nBeing just outside of the new forest has the bonus of BBQ's and fire pits, while everything within thew new forest is easily reachable.\nThe host, Caroline, was very helpful and friendly. No pressure to get up and out on departure day, in fact a text was received in the morning, to that effect! Zero stress, just what you need on a holiday.\nWe would definitely come again, if we're in the area.\nGareth, Laura and Euan",

The park is quiet and clean and the accommodation, whilst fairly basic, was clean and practicable.\n\nShower was excellent with lots of hot water - the best I have experienced in a caravan. We also needed a little heat first thing, believe it or not, on day 2 and this was also very effective and almost immediate. The only downsides, from my point of view, was the bar prices. £6+ for a bottled beer was a bit steep in my opinion. Also, the location of the park is a little remote from the main attractions such as the New Forest on the other side of the water.\n\nWould definitely recommend if you are looking for a quiet and pleasant stay but not much for kids to do. That suited us!!",

The site is flat and tents are pitched easily, the facilities are excellent - there are hot shower, toilets, washing up facilities and even a washing machine and tumble drier.\n\nI was under canvas however there are lots of options for different pitch types including for caravans and campers.\n\nWe took a walk through the nearby woodland and found it to be a really fun place for kids (and dads) to play. Location wise you can't go wrong with Brockenhurst with it's easy access to many different fun activities.\n\nThe staff were really helpful, as I've already said, and made both of us feel really welcome.

Extremely clean and well kept grounds, lovely ancient woods for walking the dog, football pitch, golf course, driving range all superb. Only slight disappointment is the pool which is very shallow all the way and often half is closed off for lessons or activities which makes swimming lengths pretty much impossible but good for young kids I guess. Sauna and steam room are nice, jacuzzi is pool temperature so not great compared to others. Club house is lovely and other than pool and jacuzzi it's a hard park to fault. Great location for accessing everything in the area.",

Unfortunately this is let down by the atrocious service in the cafe.\n\nToday i was third in the queue, but the lady serving decided it was more important to have long meandering chats with the two customers before me, and then a separate customer, and then when i did eventually get to the front of the queue she decided it was a better customer service choice to then very slowly prepare the salad to go with the toasties she had literally JUST put in the machine than serve another customer! I even asked if she could serve me but was totally ignored. Eventually after about five minutes or waiting ignored i had to leave. Atrocious customer service that needs looking at ASAP",

The pool was ok, but we booked a family fun swim which stated plenty of toys available, but we found these had to be asked for, and 3 balls were bought out, nothing else. I expect with so few staff, they can't get too much out because of time having to be spent clearing it back up.\n\nThe negatives - the changing rooms (female) were so dirty. The no shoe rule is not mentioned when you arrive and it's certainly not.followed by anyone. The ladies changing rooms also seemed to be the only available female toilet in the building, where as there is a stand alone male toilet by the hall. Meaning more shoes being worn through the changing rooms.\n\nThe floors were visibly dirty, nobody was in and out cleaning like you see at other Better Centres.\n\nAfter our swim we found there was dog poo from someone's shoe on the floor near the lockers, which i alerted staff to and the lad i spoke to was lovely and was apologetic, and said he'd tell his manager but that there were no female staff to enter the changing room and in the 40+ mins we spent in the changing rooms, it was not cleaned nor was a warning sign put up to allow people to avoid that spot at least. Nobody even came to look at it. It's my understanding you are able as staff to enter the changing rooms if you announce yourself, and wait for response.\n\nIn the group changing area there was blood stained boogers (yes, really!) dried on the wall on the right side as you walk in. Unbelievable really.\n\nReally disappointing, with the right amount of staff and standards of cleanliness this place could be an asset but it's not being cared for.\n\nOn leaving there was nobody at the welcome desk and I should think that if that's a regular thing, anyone can walk in there which isn't safe in today's society.\n\nI'm sorry to leave a bad review to be honest. But needs must.\n\nDo Better.",

The pool is designed for kids and 'teaching' which is fair.\nThere's a booking process but some people don't respect it and some days you find 30 people in a pool which has 6 lanes, obviously this is too much. Lanes are 2 slow (for people who can't swim and who just want to go and float in water), 2 medium and 2 fast. So if you want to swim you are restricted to 4 lines which is not good enough.\nAlso some people access the pool with gym t shirts and underwear and while I understand it is complicated to challenge this, it has to be done.\n\nOutside velodrome / athletics court... Very difficult to understand who can access and when. Staff refer you to website and app to find out what activities you can do, they are not aware. There's huge potential for using this but most days it is empty so clearly underutilized which means I am not the only one who is not clear about the rules.\n\nConclusion - improvement needed to make it more user friendly and control crowds a bit in the pool.",

Implementing a clearer policy regarding gym usage and ensuring consistent staff supervision would significantly improve the environment.\n\nThe Centre was also notably crowded during my visit. While I am unsure if a maximum occupancy limit is enforced, staff did mention an event was taking place, which may have contributed to the increased volume of users.

The cold bucket was fun after the sauna too.\nI wish they provided some flip flops as I forgot mine (even if they’re paid for) and wish there was more comfortable seating around to read a book as this seemed limited but didn’t detract from my overall experience.\nI also got very cold from being wet and sat outside before my massage and even after I showered I wish I’d brought an extra towel so I wasn’t sat back in a wet robe (didn’t think ahead).\nI had a full body massage and the massage rooms sit above the edge of the pool. You can hear the indistinct chatter and clanging of cutlery but I actually found this to be really relaxing rather than it being so quiet with a bit of spa music. The massage was amazing and I came out feeling so relaxed and the masseuse took me to the tea room and offered a selection of herbal teas after and it helped warm me back up.\nThe lunch was unbelievable - service was good and quick and very tasty.\nAll in all - such an amazing value spa day and really well done - there’s a few minor things that could be done to make the experience 5* overall but you can’t knock it!\nThank you so much",

The cold bucket was fun after the sauna too.\nI wish they provided some flip flops as I forgot mine (even if they’re paid for) and wish there was more comfortable seating around to read a book as this seemed limited but didn’t detract from my overall experience.\nI also got very cold from being wet and sat outside before my massage and even after I showered I wish I’d brought an extra towel so I wasn’t sat back in a wet robe (didn’t think ahead).\nI had a full body massage and the massage rooms sit above the edge of the pool. You can hear the indistinct chatter and clanging of cutlery but I actually found this to be really relaxing rather than it being so quiet with a bit of spa music. The massage was amazing and I came out feeling so relaxed and the masseuse took me to the tea room and offered a selection of herbal teas after and it helped warm me back up.\nThe lunch was unbelievable - service was good and quick and very tasty.\nAll in all - such an amazing value spa day and really well done - there’s a few minor things that could be done to make the experience 5* overall but you can’t knock it!\nThank you so much",

The hot tub was crowded and felt more like the temperature the pool should have been but was perfect on a warm day.\n\nThe food, drinks and service was impeccable.

          "reviewText": "Pros -\n\nReally thoughtfully refurbished and brought back to life. Plenty of choice when it comes to packages, combo deals. I liked the eucalyptus scent in the steam room. It felt quite spacious, considering it was a Saturday lunchtime - pool area was split into fast lane, medium lane and “chill and chat” lane. Sauna had a nice big window looking out onto the pool area, in fact generally speaking it felt quite light due to the big windows around the pool. 2 of us had neck, back, shoulder massage and facial (mine was by Michelle and my mum had Carole, who was also very good) and 1 of us had the exfoliator treatment, these were excellent and professional, felt super relaxed. Good quality herbal infusion made for us afterwards. I thought parking wasn’t bad value (£11 for the whole day paid on departure, although first 3 hours are free. Caution as there is a small car park directly in front of the Lido car park, which I believe is run by a different company). Dinner as part of the package was very good, better than we had been expecting, given some reviews. We paid extra for the steak, and had desserts. Staff explained procedures and timings / what to expect. Towel and robe provided for massage packages only (no footwear). Relaxed vibe - didn’t need to rush to get dressed post massage to enjoy our meal, we were able to eat whilst robed (I guess that could be off-putting for those only attending to eat).\n\nCons -\n\nOverall online booking process I found quite long-winded. The main pool was much colder than we were expecting (great as a cold plunge after sauna though). Hot tub was quite small, and by far the most popular area. Didn’t find jacuzzi that others mention in reviews, was there a button to activate in the hot tub? Car park is quite small, so limited availability. Some of the staff in the restaurant were not the most warm or welcoming. Would be lovely to have some fresh juices on the menu. Relax area post-massage was quite small, imagine it wouldn’t be that relaxing on a busy day. No area to lounge out and read a book, but to be honest if you booked the “swim, massage, meal” option I’m not sure where you’d find time to lounge as you’re so packed with activities and two hours pre-massage is just right to sample a little of all of the areas offered (sauna/steam/pool).",

Groups are just the right size and in the first few stages there are several extra staff in each lesson in the pool to help. My only frustration has been how difficult it can be to get spaces in a group that suits if you don't race other parents to the desk and the crammed viewing places, although they've recently allowed parents into an overflow to watch at times.\n\nI would always recommend Bradfield swimming lessons over any others in West reading.

I recently also tried Reformer Pilates for the first time in their lovely new studio and enjoyed it a lot!\n\nI also really appreciate the extras the gym has such as the sauna, complimentary drinks area and the ghd hairdryers in the women’s changing rooms and love the overall aesthetic of the place, I sometimes like going there just to read a book with a coffee before  my classes!\n\nI love how passionate the owners Isaac and Sophie are and how involved they are in the day to day running of the gym. They should be really proud of what they have created! Also the trainers are fantastic, Ramone, Ben and Keenan are one of the many there that are just so friendly and welcoming. They really are there to motivate you to achieve your fitness goals. I feel I’ve gotten so much stronger and fitter since joining and being someone who is quite self conscious in a gym setting, I’ve felt so comfortable there and actually enjoying going!\n\nOne of my favourite things is how all the trainers there know your name and try to get to know you. It really makes you feel part of a little community and family there. It’s not just a gym, it really has formed a big part of my lifestyle and has been one of the best decisions I’ve made since moving to Caversham! Could not recommend this place enough!",

We was greeted by a lovely lady who showed us where everything was. The space is absolutely beautiful with lots of privacy and it’s an amazing pool. Really loved the dolphin in the tiles. We were very impressed. My son is autistic so struggles with main pools due to him not liking people watching him swim so this gave him the opportunity to practice his swimming in private. I can’t tell you how happy he was and we both were after. We had a lovely swim! Thank you so much for sharing your lovely pool with us ❤️ we will definitely be regular customers. Absolutely love this place ☺️😊 thank you so much!",

I was on the phone to a parent while her child was swimming and suddenly I heard a women say get out I don’t want you hear! She went completely mad even threatened to call the police! There is a bench in the garden for parents to sit on while waiting for their child etc. she abused my poor friend who did not have a clue why she was told to leave especially as her child was in his lesson. This is not the first time the women has hurled abuse at parents. Also it frightened the next child who was getting ready to go to her lesson and had special needs.\nI could not believe what I was hearing and it upset me to hear someone speak to my dear friend in that manner.\nPlease avoid.\nAfter her reply***\n** I am very upset and concerned by your reply to my post! It is pure lies on your behalf I was on the phone and heard every word of abuse that came out of your mouth to my friend. You were vile. I told her to record your behaviour for evidence which she did do! The two children, waiting for their lesson always spoke to my friend and her son who is special needs and a gentle man. The coach has never or ever had any problems with my friend or son. It was discussed with the coach that she was better off outside on the bench provide for people waiting as her son had much better concentration due to autism. My friend was never told about any so called rules that you had to stay at the side of the pool and the coach was happy with her to be outside. You have been abusive to many coaches and clients which I can clearly see in all your reviews. Not once was my friend abusive or aggressive to you or anyone else in all the time she has been going there. That is not even in her nature. You are trying to degrade and make out that my friend is trouble when that is pure lies and it’s you. My friend will go out of her way to be friendly, kind and caring about anyone especially special\nEdit ****** After you have deleted your first reply and wrote another one which is worse than the one before!\nSo now you have deleted your last reply, and came up with more pure lies!! You have now involved the coach and even lied about her! It was the coach who asked my friend to sit outside as her son concentrated better without her there! Her son who is autistic and very gentle, the one you keep rudely referring to as a large size male! You also repeatedly say you do not want him unaccompanied near other people! I would like to know what you actually mean by that? As I said he is a very quiet, gentle vulnerable autistic adult.\nYou refer to “staff “ when the only staff present was the one swimming coach who was with her son and who could not see outside due to being in the pool, teaching her son. This same swimming coach is the one who is frightened of you but can not say anything thing as she does not want to loose her job.  However she did tell my friend that this was not the first time you have shown such vile behaviour and to read your reviews! You have also said my friend made the right decision not to come back but previously you lied and said it was you who told her not to come back. At no time was my friend aggressive or threatened the coach or anyone else. My friend is not a nasty or violent person.\nAs for me harassing you that is more lies. I have only written the truth on here and when you were recommended on line I have told people to read the reviews before booking! That is not slander or harassment in any way. Like I said you have deleted your first reply and now come back with this disgraceful slanderous reply which is full of lies. Your first reply was a week after my review and you changed it last week which is two months after my review! I am concerned why you needed to delete your review and put this rubbish up which actually makes you look worse than before and proves my point that you have broken regulations.\nAs for commenting about my health I would just like to say my health is perfect thank you but I am concerned about yours.",

From our very first phone call, Sandra was incredibly understanding and kind — I immediately felt reassured. I had a good feeling, but what followed completely exceeded my expectations.\n\nFrom the very first lesson, I was blown away. The level of expertise, patience, and insight from the instructors was remarkable. In just one hour, my daughter made progress that she hadn’t in months elsewhere.

Their attentiveness & care was truly exceptional, and all of the people who joined specifically mentioned how they had made their experience so fulfilling.\n\nA lot of the people who came had never wild swum before, and some had said they were quite nervous ahead of time! But with Tom and Raisie's support, everyone managed to get in the water, and not only that – they properly enjoyed the experience, with first-time swimmers now total cold-water converts!\n\nI also recognised and was so grateful to Tom and Raisie for all the behind-the-scenes work they did to ensure I could focus on enjoying the day, and less on hosting. They were checking in with my guests, offering tea and refreshments, maintaining the sauna & checking in with me at points throughout the day to make sure I felt comfortable. Looking back, I'm convinced they must be totally superhuman to have managed the experience so smoothly!\n\nThe magic of Wasing is that the moment I stepped away, I immediately missed it – and part of that was the energy and experience that our hosts created. The scenery itself is stunning, deeply memorable and totally tranquil. I will always remember my 30th being full of joy (and forcing my loved ones to love wild swimming!)\n\nThanks to the whole team for everything they did – I hope to be back for another birthday soon for more Wasing magic!",

Music is okay from considerable speaker system. Parking - good luck with that! And when leaving the tricky road layout is a white knuckle logic test for sure.

The space is huge with lots and lots of machines—whether you’re into cardio, free weights, plate-loaded strength or functional training, you’ll find everything you could want. According to their kit list they have 250+ machines, a large free weights & cardio area, an Eleiko functional rig, sled track, dedicated glute zone, etc.  ￼\n\nThe staff are super supportive and friendly. From checking you in to helping you with equipment or just offering tips, they make the gym feel welcoming rather than intimidating.\n\nI’m also a big fan of the sauna and luxury changing rooms—they’re a real bonus after a tough session.\n\nThe only thing to note is that it can get quite busy on Monday and Tuesday evenings (and evenings in general). If you prefer a quieter session you might want to go a bit earlier or later.\n\nOverall, for the quality of the facility, the variety of equipment, the free parking and 24/7 access, this gym is a fantastic choice in Basingstoke. Highly recommend!",

I had a lovely time and it has definitely changed my mind on massages. Both parts were very relaxing and would highly recommend to everyone.\nThe room is very clean and comfortable. Lovely big window, with good blackout curtains. Has a lot of sockets, for a variety of cables, I would assume for those staying for business.

There's a well-maintained kitchen here that I used to cook an evening meal, and multiple showers/bathrooms on all floors.\n\nThey also offer breakfast. As I was the only one there that early, the gentleman working was very attentive, and made me my own cafetiere of coffee.

The location was quiet.\n\nThe hostel was quite quiet, not many people were booked in when I stayed but that could have been for a number of reasons, I hear a rowing club was booked in the weekend before.\n\nStaff were friendly and professional.\n\nMy room was not ensuite. There was shared toilet and showers nearby although I understand some rooms do have their own showers. There are enough communal showers for when it is full.\n\nOne good thing for me is that you did not need to go too far from your room to the kitchen, so after a long walk when you have taken your coat and shoes off you just need to pop down one flight to the kitchen. I've stayed in hostels where my room has been on the other side of the building to the kitchen.\n\nThere is a self catering kitchen and also the option to have a cooked breakfast. I wasn't staying long so brought my own breakfast and ate at the pub next door or went to the Fish and Chip shop in Goring.\n\nAs the hostel was pretty quiet I was a bit apprehensive about staying there but I was assured that the managers were close by and I was told there is a number to call in an emergency, I felt a bit better after that.\n\nIt is in need of refurbishment and an update of furniture etc.\n\nMy only gripe was that it does need a good clean and dusting. There was a lot of dust on the skirting and windowsills. There was dust on the rungs of the bunk bed and it really bothered my allergies. I was only booked in for two nights but if I was there longer I would have bought some wipes to give my room an extra clean so that I wasn't affected too much. I understand some places gather dust more than others so this is not a bad comment against the managers who were extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nI definitely would consider this hostel again if considering staying in the area again.",

It seemed that many of the guests were junkies and the surrounding area is pretty sketchy too. The room was not clean, with stains on the mattress, bathroom counter and shower. It smelt of the restaurant below. The room was noisy as the outer windows (rooms are fitted with secondary glazing) were broken and wouldn’t even vaguely shut, so the noise of the ring road penetrated the inner windows.\n\nAll in, the cheap rate is telling - there’s a reason it’s so cheap despite its central location! Basically it seems to be a probation hostel that is long overdue a complete refit and rebrand. Come on Travelodge, you can do better than this!",

Easy to use and v hi-tech, checking in was simply a case of entering our code and walking in.\n\nWe also reserved a space in the private car park to the rear - the access road was a little tight at the beginning, but we got through OK and the car park was easy to access (also with a code).\n\nOur room was at the front and were a bit concerned about comments in earlier reviews re. road noise.  The road is certainly busy, but during the recent renovations they replaced the windows with acoustic glass and it seems to have made a big difference and we had no problem relaxing and sleeping.\n\nLocation-wise, it was a short walk to the town centre.  The riverside and park are even closer and made for a lovely stroll in the sun (we were lucky with the weather!).\n\nOur room also had it's own fridge and microwave, but the hotel was surrounded by food and drink opportunities and we enjoyed drinks at The Moderation (nice atmosphere), dinner at the Standard Tandoori (great food and v friendly staff), and a delicious breakfast at the Richfields Deli.\n\nOverall, a very nice stay in Reading.",

Easy to use and v hi-tech, checking in was simply a case of entering our code and walking in.\n\nWe also reserved a space in the private car park to the rear - the access road was a little tight at the beginning, but we got through OK and the car park was easy to access (also with a code).\n\nOur room was at the front and were a bit concerned about comments in earlier reviews re. road noise.  The road is certainly busy, but during the recent renovations they replaced the windows with acoustic glass and it seems to have made a big difference and we had no problem relaxing and sleeping.\n\nLocation-wise, it was a short walk to the town centre.  The riverside and park are even closer and made for a lovely stroll in the sun (we were lucky with the weather!).\n\nOur room also had it's own fridge and microwave, but the hotel was surrounded by food and drink opportunities and we enjoyed drinks at The Moderation (nice atmosphere), dinner at the Standard Tandoori (great food and v friendly staff), and a delicious breakfast at the Richfields Deli.\n\nOverall, a very nice stay in Reading.",

The secure car parking was excellent, check if you drive something really big, but the ad doesn’t mention there were a couple of free spaces available on the road as well when we were there. I took the photo below because I had decided to add a review at breakfast the next day and hoped it might help someone. I would book parking again next time, but if they were full, I’d check the roadside before going to the station which is really close anyway. Lovely newly renovated place, good shower pressure on first floor is always important to me, good food nearby and an unexpected lovely walk down the river. All round, if you want Reading, hard to think of a more pleasant and better value option that has moved me to do a review - something I rarely do. These people have made an effort👍",

Convenient location with 10 minutes walk to Henley.\nSwimming pool was great fun. It is good that it needs to be booked ahead to ensure it doesn't get overcrowded.\nOne dissapointment was the showers - extremely weak water pressure, barely more than a dribble.",

We were stuck in traffic on the M25 and called to ask if there was anything available. Check-in is until 7:30 p.m. (the office says 8:00 p.m.), and we said that we didn't know if we would make it because of the traffic. Any other campsite: No problem, book online and we'll send you a code. Or park somewhere and pay tomorrow. This one: Tough luck. We made it, and at the entrance there's a sign: Stop here, stay in your car, don't go to reception, someone will come. We stood there for a long time, but finally went to reception. There we were told that we should have driven one meter further so that the camera could see us! (The waiting area is right in front of the reception window...) The pitch was small.\nThe showers are reasonably sized, but there is no bench. They look modern, but they are a complete failure. Instead of a push button, there is a motion sensor. The idea is that when you stand under it, the shower runs – which is actually good. But here you have to wave your hand directly in front of it, which makes it just as bad as a push button. Worse still, you can't stay in front of it because if you move again, the shower turns off. So you have to wait every time for it to turn off before you can restart it—every few seconds, including temperature fluctuations. Great for washing your hair. I wonder if the people who came up with this idea have ever taken a shower in their lives! Overall, not a pleasant place.",

The receptionist wasn't too happy we drove straight in as the barrier was up ?\nWhen I showed the lady my email confirmation, she asked for my membership card or proof on the app. I explained that we had just bought the motorhome and hadn't transferred everything from our old van yet. She advised me to download the app and log in to access the internet. By that time, I was flustered and had trouble remembering passwords. She insisted on seeing proof of identity, stating that failing to ask these questions would be discriminatory towards other site users. After turning our motorhome upside down, I found an old card, which proved to be useless and gave her the same info as the email ?\n\nI preferred to pay in cash, as it was a Christmas gift, but was told that ID was required for cash payments. This was never mentioned in the paperwork and I had never been asked for ID before? The receptionist saw I wasn't happy and tried to change her tone by offering me a dry mince pie and flat Buck's Fizz. By then, I really needed a brandy and just wanted to get out of there.\nI refused to return to the office, so my husband went in to ask if we could move. Despite there being six empty blue-pegged pitches, she made a fuss but agreed .\n\nOn a positive note, the site itself was pleasant , with clean and serviceable showers and toilets. However, cleaning at peak times between 10:30 AM and 12:00 PM was inconvenient. Although you can hear the busy road, the 20-minute walk into town makes it worthwhile, being so close to Henley. We will return and have everything to hand now we know . CAMC can you update your rules to prevent other members starting off their break miserably .\n\nSent from Outlook for iOS",

The sausage bap was terrible - wet and stale roll, no serviettes available. The drinks machine was warm as it was not even turned on - not too big a deal generally by the one male member of staff that we saw did not even pretend to acknowledge or care about the drinks machine, or lack of high chairs.

Paid parking underneath the building (pay on exit - use the machine as no mobile coverage down there). The basement houses a climbing wall and ski simulator. Ground floor has the gym, which looked to be very popular, a huge reception area with a Starbucks, and the 25m pool. Had to book in at reception to get a slip of paper to scan in to the pool changing facilities (remember to save it as you'll need it to scan out too). Changing facilities were clean with free lockers and warm showers. Pool is wide and has moveable floor - half being given over to aqua aerobics when we were there. The lanes are a uniform 2m depth, so no lounging around at the shallow end. Pool was clean and lifeguards were attentive. Would definitely visit again.",

I found that I have received support from other personal trainers which is a really nice bonus. I can't fault this at all.\n\nI am a great lover of swimming. I really like this pool as it's dimmed and I appreciate that after hours in harshly lit office light. The times that I've been able to go swimming I have thoroughly enjoyed my time there.\nHowever (and this is a big however for me) I have come in twice this week to find that the main pool has no lanes so I'm not able to swim.\nThe lane swimming and adults only are at obscure times where I don't have the time to access so I can only go on the weekends - for adults only which is preferable that means coming in rather early or late. Both are not ideal for a weekend to rest.\n\nMy other gripe with the centre is that the women's changing rooms always seem to be filled with screaming children. I have nearly tripped over a couple of them running about and one child pushed the door shut so I couldn't access the changing rooms until the mum came to leave. I wouldn't mind children being in there if they behaved but a majority of time they aren't. A family changing area would be a good solution.\n\nOverall; I'm glad I joined - particularly for the gym.

Whether it’s early morning or a busy evening, Finn has a smile and makes you feel welcome.\n\nKnows the equipment well. Not just the basics, but tips on form, alternatives, spotting when machines are mis-used, and offering helpful suggestions without being pushy.\n\nGreat with spotting/training help. If you ask Finn to check your form or spot you while lifting, you actually feel safer and more confident than with many other staff.\n\nProactive in ensuring cleanliness & order. Finn seems to notice when equipment needs attention, or when areas (such as around the pool or changing rooms) could use better upkeep, and either fixes it or reports it.\n\nFriendly without being overbearing. Knowing when to chat, when to give space, when someone looks like they could use encouragement.\n\nFinn definitely makes a difference. Often, experiences that might be “meh” are pulled up by staff like Finn being attentive — it adds that human touch that really matters.",

Excellent gym coaches here, there’s even boxing to anyone who’s interested headed by Dave. HIIT classes by Alison are great too.",

The gym is clean but the showers were absolutely disgusting. I'm not sure why you guys leave your skiddy pants in the showers but grow up, mummy isn't cleaning up after you here. However with only one shower out of 5 working, the one that was was full of pubic hair and utterly vile. I told the manager who having plenty of time to restock profitable vending machines told me \"we try our best\". Well then Pure management is letting you down. Disgusting changing rooms, but decent gym. Advice - Shower at home, don't bother complaining either.",

Many lockers that don't lock because of defective mechanisms are of no use. A shame pure gym doesn't seem to take members personal belongings seriously.\n\nOriginal review of 5 years below. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nMy first time at this gym was today. The gym was clean, the shower, toilets and changing facilities also clean. The gym equipment clean and working. The background music level was balanced, so you could put your Earphones in comfortably listen to your own music. Overall I'm really impressed with this gym - I've been yo a few over the years and this one is up there with the best, at aroind half the cost! The changing room is IMO a bit small, but I can't really take one star off for that. 😊",

The best view, and so lovely to run into the sea and then back in the sauna. We had breakfast from the cafe brought to us on the beach by the amazing staff. Just a shame that there are no lockers for valuables or anywhere sheltered to get changed in. It would be good if they were allowed to expand like the ones in Brighton and Margate. Will definitely be going again. .",

My key stopped working one afternoon and I asked reception for help and they said in a rather rude and abrupt way to log it with maintenance and wait. I found this odd because usually maintenance requests take 3-5 days to fix and the receptionist didn’t explain that this would be sorted quicker. I still waited 45 minutes to get into my room and this made me late to a lecture. Whenever there are issues with the washing machines the attitude of the staff is that it has nothing to do with them and they can’t help, again in an abrupt way. When the power went out in our flat the receptionist said she couldn’t help and we’d have to move our food into the staff freezer, we later learned it was just a trip switch that the receptionist could’ve switched, a member of security came to fix it for us and told us “the receptionist was just being lazy”. When one of my flatmates was constantly smoking in the flat it wasn’t dealt with appropriately. Two security staff are incredibly rude and did not deal with an issue in our flat appropriately or professionally at all. They stood in our hallway shouting at us and talking over us any time we tried to explain something or ask a question. There was no need for their behaviour when we were trying to have a calm and reasonable conversation with them. Overall, I have had a really unpleasant experience at Catherine House and I cannot recommend it to anyone looking to stay here",

As soon as I arrived in my flat I had to deal with a cold shower, a broken chair and a dusty room. The shower was fixed after two weeks, during which I managed by using a cup to pour hot water from the tap for my showers. The chair was replaced 2 months after. Rooms accumulate dust very quickly so you have to clean every once in a while. Some other problems are the noises, like the ones that come from a valve in the toilet. Doors have closers that make them close with force and some people just bang their doors. Also walls are made out of plasterboard so you can hear pretty much everything. You can hear your flat mates that just don't have the consciousness that they are in shared apartments or what time it is. Many were the nights that woke me up. Another major problem with the noise is the fire alarm. Before Christmas holidays it would go off every week and it's loud as hell. They have literally cameras in all common spaces except the hallway which is the most obvious place to place a camera so you can identify who is banging on your door and disrespecting the other flat mates. Lastly, it's very overpriced which means that you don't get what you pay for. I can't believe I paid 10K to live under these conditions. All these problems are pretty much common in all student halls so if you want to have a peaceful and healthy student life try to avoid them.",

I don’t understand why they were not given to start with as she knew we were in a rush. On the way out (12:12) I said “next time give the towels to clients earlier, we are now checked out late” and instead of any sort of apology we got “I didn’t know you were checking out”. Even though my partner specifically said we needed those quickly. Rude, not professional, on her phone instead of working - Awful behaviour, we just wanted towels.

Actually, I could make it work. The room itself was Super small - putting 2 additional beds was laughable as the room was barely large enough for the one double. The facilities were Super basic. Apparently, according to the front desk staff, the additional features of this room included a hair dryer - yes, really, apparently hair dryers are an upgrade - an iron and ironing board - we couldn't comment on this as they were in the wardrobe that we couldn't access as there was a bed in the way (did I mention the room was Super small?) - a coffee machine which didn't stop - Super annoying - and a comfy arm chair, which may have been Super comfy but we couldn't use it because there were beds in the way!\nAll in all a Super waste of money and Super dissappointing!\nWe were Super quick at identifying these issues and spoke to the Super staff and the front desk who was Super helpful but ultimately could do nothing as the hotel was Super busy! In fact all the staff were Super friendly!\nSo to summarise Super quickly, if you're thinking of booking a super room don't bother. If you have a family trip to Portsmouth - which is Super interesting - you may find more Super accomodation booking with a different well known, budget hotel. I won't say which, but I suggest your experience will be a Premier one!",

We spent three nights in a tent, and the pitch was a good size, big enough for a big tent and two cars, offering just enough privacy. The grounds are very clean, and so are sanitary facilities with very nice showers (plenty of hot water and good pressure). Our 4 y o granddaughter loved the pool, too. Magnetic cards opening barriers are a very convenient solution. The atmosphere is that of a family picnic and we really enjoyed it. There's a big very well-stocked Lidl a short walk from the campsite and the beach is a 5-min drive away with plenty of parking spaces available. Our only recommendation would be to have the cafe open daily rather than 5 days a week. We will certainly return for a longer stay!",

Pitched up as told to when we called for gate code when we had arrived, owner turned up when we all set up to tell us it was £20 for tents, £30 for caravan, £5 for car and £20 for event shelter a night! This was not mentioned on any call to him and it was not on the facebook page, he has added the price of car now, have never been to a site that charges you for your car, extra cars yes. We were going to stay for a night and find somewhere else to move on to but too late for a big group, so we were stuck, he did knock a little off whole price, we decided to make best of it. Field was lovely and fire pits good idea, toilets had no proper lights, just solar lights that kept going off, 1 womans toilet, 2 mens and urinals which were clean but not kept topped up with toilet roll, nothing to dry hands on. A ram was in the field! Is that allowed!? No shelter, water was disgusting,  kids playing on field with his poop everywhere, and had to avoid it when putting tents up, he escaped under fence into road one morning and guy from our group followed it up road so it didn't get hurt, was gone nearly an hour before losing it, no thanks at all and was suggested gate was left open! You can see the wool stuck to the fence he went through! Owner was not welcoming and appeared to have a problem with us from the start when we questioned prices, told us you wouldn't get this price with what is there anywhere! Yes mate, you can  and we have! Had high hopes of a nice little site, but will not be going back.",

From this site we walked along the coast path to Langstone harbour , cycled to Fishbourne where we picked up the Salterns cycle path (mostly off road) to West wittering, and visited Bosham on the cycle back. Also close to Thorney Island which we walked around. We would return. It’s a great little site.",

All the usual and expected facilities (shower block etc. etc.), all of which were clean and in good working order. I didn't see a specific motorhome drainage point, although I did notice motorhomes filling with water from the water point. Dogs allowed on site, but I don't think they have a dog-walking area. I have no hesitation in returning next time.",

When I arrived, I was pitched next to a free camper van pitch (there are no designated pitches for tents). Late at night, while I was sleeping, I heard a motor very close to my tent and saw the lights of vehicles right on my tent. This woke me up instantly. Then the vehicle stopped right next to me and it took them 30 minutes to set up, making noise the whole time (plugging in electricity, walking around in the gravel, slamming doors, etc.). While the campsite is not responsible for the noise, they could have directed the camper van to another pitch — there were many other free ones.\nAlso, there are no sockets in the toilets or showers if you want to charge your phone.\nIn my opinion, the price is too high for the night spent.\nTo improve the camping experience, it would be good to have grass pitches for all tents rather than being placed between camper vans.",

The toilet and shower blocks are the best campsite facilities I've come across (though we live in Spain and most of our camping is in Spain or Portugal). Bear in mind they are closed from 10:30 to approx 12:00 for cleaning. There is a dog friendly pub just less than 5 mins walk from the site with super friendly staff. If you should get stuck in your van due to a torrential downpour (guess what happened to us 😁) then there is also a choice of Indian or Chinese restaurants that will deliver to the site. There is more around to look at but the weather wasn't good to us. Very near to Portsmouth if you need a pit stop and rest before you get a ferry across the water  😁⛴️",

To be fair you go above and beyond what you need to do, tea and milk in your accommodation and much more, fantastic idea. Thank you and all the team for a amazing weekend wish it was longee.

We were booked in a premium room on the 5th floor with amazing views of Spinnaker Tower. The premium room had complimentary biscuits, drinking chocolate, tea, Pepsi, kit kats and bottled water. there was also a coffee machine and a mini fridge. The staff were very friendly and helpful and gave us some excellent recommendations for local excursions. This was our third stay at this hotel and will definitely stay here again when visiting Portsmouth.",

Excellent facilities including Swimming pool, Gym, Sauna and jacuzzi. parking available at £5 overnight, can get busy but permits are provided for road side parking if no parking space is available at the hotel's car park. We were booked in a premium room on the 5th floor with amazing views of Spinnaker Tower. The premium room had complimentary biscuits, drinking chocolate, tea, Pepsi, kit kats and bottled water. there was also a coffee machine and a mini fridge. The staff were very friendly and helpful and gave us some excellent recommendations for local excursions. This was our third stay at this hotel and will definitely stay here again when visiting Portsmouth.",

Really easy access to the site from the hotel.\nThe rooms were a little on the small side - or perhaps just overly furnished? I think some space could've been created by having the TV on the wall & the huge table desk removed. Staff were lovely though. Breakfast was good (although we were directed to sit at an uncleared table one morning with the promise it would be cleaned...and it wasn't 😕). Shower was good. Room was hot & air-con didn't seem to work. But heavy curtains and fan helped. Overall- good stay - if perhaps a tad pricey.",

On arrival, we pulled up outside what we thought was our caravan and my husband got out the car to go and see which number it was and we were approached by a white maintenance vehicle. The person tooted as he couldn’t get passed. A man with a long beard got out of this vehicle who I guess was staff and said to my husband in a rude manner, ‘mate you can’t park there’ he was literally just seeing what number the caravan was. How rude! We had a leak the first night through the vent in the roof, no big deal but this was a constant drip. We reported the next day to the young girl on the reception desk who didn’t really seem to care and said she would get someone round. No one came! The swimming pool was freezing and I would say is not suitable for anyone under the age of 2. Her lips were blue!!\nI have no complaints about the entertainment at all. The team were amazing and we saw the best tribute to Beyoncé Iv ever seen!!\nCan’t comment on the restaurant because we didn’t eat in there but the pub down the road is insane for a roast.\nWould I go back? Yes I would but maybe in the summer so we can enjoy the outdoors a bit more.",

          "reviewText": "So we arrived the evening of Halloween 31st October at 4pm. On arrival, we pulled up outside what we thought was our caravan and my husband got out the car to go and see which number it was and we were approached by a white maintenance vehicle. The person tooted as he couldn’t get passed. A man with a long beard got out of this vehicle who I guess was staff and said to my husband in a rude manner, ‘mate you can’t park there’ he was literally just seeing what number the caravan was. How rude! We had a leak the first night through the vent in the roof, no big deal but this was a constant drip. We reported the next day to the young girl on the reception desk who didn’t really seem to care and said she would get someone round. No one came! The swimming pool was freezing and I would say is not suitable for anyone under the age of 2. Her lips were blue!!\nI have no complaints about the entertainment at all. The team were amazing and we saw the best tribute to Beyoncé Iv ever seen!!\nCan’t comment on the restaurant because we didn’t eat in there but the pub down the road is insane for a roast.\nWould I go back? Yes I would but maybe in the summer so we can enjoy the outdoors a bit more.",

No warning….. so 20+ members having to use 2 lanes. This I have been told is a monthly “thing”; so this is on top of the fact that every school break/holiday we totally loose the middle of the day Lane Swim option for weeks on end….. Am I really being unreasonable to float the idea that this is not fulfilling the companies side of our membership? Kingsmead: Please book staff training for the many periods when the pool is not open to fee paying members; And preserve at least 1 middle of the day Lane Swim option during all school holidays. The policy is geared to penalise members quick enough if for some reason we fail to attend a prebooked session, please have the courtesy to fulfil our membership agreement….",

They created a programme specifically for me, taking into account my recent injury, and then provided a very thorough induction. The gym is very clean and tidy and you will regularly see the staff cleaning all areas. The equipment is well maintained and since I joined in April this year I have never seen anything “out of order”. The changing rooms are spacious with trolly token operated lockers and showers. There are many classes available too which are easily booked via the app. I don’t think you will find any other gym in Canterbury with such a friendly and more dedicated team.",

There is a wide array of free weights to use and quite a few moveable benches available too. Also a few squat racks as well, which is always nice. I went on a bank holiday during peak hours and it was quite busy to be honest, but didn’t spend any time waiting around. Changing rooms very clean as well. My only negative takeaway from my experience is that it was quite warm in the gym, and the AC wasn’t that strong, but honestly not a terrible thing as I’m yet to visit a gym in England with decent AC haha!\n\nOverall would recommend this gym, definitely use a free day pass to try it out!",

A month and looking like a rundown public centre on the other hand  the Dover  leisure centre  is free to use for the public there are no costly contracts cancel any time, there was no upgrade in decor or facilities at Bannatyne which you would expect for a private centre, the Dover centre costs £45. For the full package and the centre it's self is so much better. The decor the space the facilities the cleanliness friendliness and amount of changing rooms showers lockers ect never failed me this is what I'd expect from a private centre but I must say Bannatyne in Ashford Kent is a good large centre in my experience it's only been the Broadstairs centre that let's them down. 😀",

We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

The staff are friendly and helpful, telling us that until recently the pool was heated by the brewing process! Despite its long history the pool is immaculately clean, the water was probably around 25° when we visited, and the site is well maintained. Lockers are available on site, traditional changing cubicles with hot showers and toilets, a tuck shop, picnic tables, children's play area, and an additional small pool for toddlers means that there's something for everyone. Parking is free, although I assume that the car park will fill quickly on hot days. We went for a lane swim - one fast, two medium, and a double-width slow lane were available with a very attentive life guard looking on throughout. We really enjoyed our visit 💕",

Great, helpful, friendly staff and lots of fun in the pool for children (unlike the Street one where children cannot play!) There were floats, beach balls, toys for little children and lots of acrobatics. The life guards were reasonable and kept everyone safe without being militant (like at the Street one) The water is slightly cooler and changing facilities not perhaps as good as Greenbanks, but we preferred it as the fun two hours were so much more enjoyable than the day pass at Greenbanks. We shall return many a times I'm sure! Thoroughly recommend it to families with children!",

Sections of the pool, which is an irregular shape, are divided into  slides/splash area, an area for families, and a section for lane swimming. The outdoor pool is part of a leisure centre with indoor pool, but access to the outdoor pool is separate to the leisure centre and can be reached via the car park. Plenty of free parking. We went for an early morning lane swim - there were only 4 of us in the pool, so plenty of space and the local/regular swimmers made us feel really welcome (even giving us 'Friends of Aldershot Lido' swimming caps, which were a lovely souvenir of our visit). The laned section of the pool is about 25-30m & fairly deep. Pool is well maintained and lovely to see the traditional fountain in operation. Changing facilities are basic but clean & clean toilets and hot showers. Lockers available poolside, but bring padlock. Overall we really enjoyed our visit 😊",

There was plenty of seating suitable for small and larger groups. I was in a group of 5 and we were able to comfortably sit together in the sitting room and around the pool area.\n\nThe pool was lovely and warm and the sauna was great too. There were plenty of showering facilities, so I didn't need to wait for a turn and overall everything was well presented.\n\nThere were tea and coffee making facilities available with unlimited access and plenty of water  stations dotted around. The lunch was delicious, we had a daal curry and a fruity posset.\n\nI had a full body massage, which was wonderful. The therapist had just the right amount of pressure, she checked in with me as to whether I wanted my feet and tummy massaged too, which I did and overall I came out feeling super relaxed and well after a lovely day.\n\nI'll definitely be going back with my partner in the future and now I know where it is, it'll be a little easier to find as the road sign was a little small for me and I didn't see it at first from the direction I came in.",

You will find some plates left here or there but please understand the staff are also teaching classes and doing personal training sessions.\n\nParking-\nI cannot see you ever having a problem finding a place to park and if you’re worried about crossing there is zebra crossings marks on the road at the main roundabout to get you across.\n\n-Price\nI pay for their most expensive option for a membership, and I personally feel like It’s a complete steal. I also use their hydration stations a well. I cannot believe I don't pay more. I want the gym to start selling merch or something so I can help pay for more equipment and show my support.\n\nIn conclusion from someone who has never used a commercial gym I have never felt or performed this good before.

          "reviewText": "I’ve been staying here since September 2023 and have had a great time so far with only a few issues.\nI’ve noticed people talking about the vending machines, I’ve never had any issues or had them break on me, they’re always working for me at least.\nPeople are saying our AM, Maria, is rude, however I’ve never had this problem with her, she is friendly and always up for a chat, like most of the reception staff too. If you treat them with respect then they’ll treat you the same way back.\n\nThe main few issues are the washing and drying machines. I’ve only used them a few times as I take my washing home most weekends, but whenever I use them there’s either an issue with draining from the washing machine and I have to call up the company, or the dryers don’t actually dry my clothes. Also give the machines about 5-10 more minutes than it says on the app as it goes on for longer. However it’s an outside company called Wash Station and it’s nothing to really do with Novel.\nIn the contract and if you go on tours before moving in, you’re told you have bike hires, however this isn’t true, they have no bikes in the shed at the moment.\nThe study area I feel needs to be a bit more closed off as it’s directly next to the cinema room and private kitchen, where people have parties/watch films/listen to music, and you can hear everything.\nThere was a previous issue with someone blasting music from their window at full volume at all hours of the day, I rang a few times on different days but eventually went downstairs and our lovely security guard sorted it and I haven’t had any issues with loud music since.\n\nOverall it’s a lovely place to live, with a small area behind with a Battle Bar, Desserts Restaurant, and a few other restaurants. There’s also Curzon cinema which is great too. Directly underneath E block/right next to the accommodation there’s a Fireway pizza which is good and a Starry Mart which sells Asian food and toys, which is also nice. The cinema room is nice and a great way to meet new friends, the gym is also good with lots of equipment, there’s also pool, fooßall, and table tennis/ping pong which are fun to use.",

Cobwebs and insects in the corner of the bedroom and a mattress so springy and uncomfortable. The keycard to my room didn’t even work on my first night there. On my 2nd day there I was just chilling on my bed when some worker just opened my door. I mean what if I was just getting out the shower or changing. It is so unacceptable! When he opened the door (literally wide open!) he said, “oh sorry” and I said, “are you here to fix my keycard for my room” he said “yes” and shut the door and just left and didn’t do anything. Regardless of whether him opening the door was a mistake or not, it is not ok for an unauthorised entry into my room to occur. Especially when I’m paying 7k for it. And in my section, all the rooms that were clearly unoccupied had their doors fully open and the beds up (as they are storage beds that can be lifted). And my room is right at the end and one room opposite me and one room next to me the doors were fully shut clearly indicating they were occupied so it was quite silly for someone to walk past many unoccupied rooms and used a keycard to open it with no knock or anything.\nI told my mum about this, and she was not happy at all as well and she wanted me to leave straight away after this incident had happened. After re-reading the contract again it was a clear breach when the guy opened my door without prior, written notice therefore, we should have the tenancy cancelled and not be liable for rent. As firstly why am I going to pay rent for a place that does things like that and clearly doesn’t clean the room before a new tenant moves in. We spoke to the property manager who was helpful, and she said to me and mum that the tenancy would be cancelled. That was all ok initially, but they have been trying to take the rent from me which I should not have to pay, so I went back telling them that I have received notifications about rent and then the property manager said to me that you still must pay rent until a replacement tenant is found. This is understandable if I was just no longer wanting to stay there. However, due to what happened it should not make me have to find a replacement and still pay rent. The tenancy should just be cancelled and that’s that.\nOverall, I wouldn’t sign a contract here, Just Don’t Do It! The reviews on their page are already bad I’m only adding fuel to the fire.",

The fact this accommodation had a 2.6 rating a few weeks ago and it’s suddenly jumped to 3.8 is telling, despite there being only one 5 star review in this timeframe. The only good things about this place are its prices and ok room size. The cons, there’s a lot of cons. Trying to communicate with Cloud student homes is like trying to talk to a ghost. They respond to emails incredibly slow and they won’t even pick up the phone. Upon arriving in my room, the floor was dirty, the toilet had human waste in it and on the toilet seat. The drawers still had food inside and dust was everywhere. When I questioned the manager she told me I should have booked an appointment of arrival so it could be cleaned properly. Even though I did book an appointment scheduled 2 hours before I actually got into my room. For the next 2 weeks my cluster didn’t have a microwave for 2 whole weeks. For 5 days, the building didn’t have running hot water. For nearly 2 days there wasn’t any working WiFi. As I write now the WiFi isn’t working and even if it does, sometimes it’s slow to the point my phone will connect to mobile data instead. I also had to wait 2 weeks for my cluster’s stove to be replaced and the cleaners barely do any work in the kitchen. I’d like to be generous but there’s far too many issues to be ignored and my experience going by the other reviews isn’t unique either. I would advise living at this accommodation unless you need to save money. God bless.",

          "reviewText": "My experience at Canterbury Student Village has been extremely disappointing and concerning from the very start. When I first moved in, my flat and room were in an unliveable condition — there was dirt swept behind the bed, the kitchen contained mouldy, decayed food frozen to the fridge, and it was clear no cleaning staff had entered since the previous occupants left. The state of the flat felt borderline a biohazard.\n\nWhen I raised this issue, the staff member on duty initially tried to justify the situation by saying this was “the cheapest accommodation in Canterbury,” which is not true and completely irrelevant — no level of pricing excuses giving students a filthy, unsafe room. After a long discussion, I was only offered a room change when the manager arrived. The manager’s response was unprofessional, even suggesting I cancel my booking because she thought I would “give her a headache” later for reporting issues.\n\nThe second room I received was only slightly better. It still had spiders, stains on the carpet, and an old mattress, but at least it was somewhat habitable. However, the problems continued. A few weeks later, the blinds fell down — they had been attached with a single screw, a clear safety hazard.\n\nOther ongoing issues include:\n\nWeak, unreliable Wi-Fi that has gone down multiple times, making studying extremely difficult.\n\nPoor parcel handling — parcels arriving over the weekend aren’t collected, and even when they are, you often have to wait more than a day for a QR code before being allowed to pick them up.\n\nVisible neglect in the building, such as a hole in the wall near the entrance that was “repaired” by crudely hammering a piece of wood over it, and a persistent unpleasant smell on entry.\n\nMost recently, no hot water for two days, and when I asked staff what to do, I was told to “use a kettle” to heat water — a completely unsafe and unacceptable suggestion. When I asked for temporary access to another room to shower, they refused to help, saying I could only do so during reception hours.\n\nIt’s clear that serious health, safety, and management issues exist here, and many problems are either ignored or handled very slowly. I’m genuinely considering taking this matter to small claims court due to the poor living conditions, lack of duty of care, and negligence I’ve experienced.\n\nI would strongly advise future students to avoid Canterbury Student Village until major improvements are made in cleanliness, safety, and management professionalism.",

          "reviewText": "I dropped off my daughter here nearly 2 weeks ago and she was one of the first to move in.  This is my honest opinions as a Father.\n\nCleanliness on Arrival:  The whole unit was dirty with lots of dead insects, cobwebs and dust in the rooms and communal areas.\nState of Room: Terrible.  The mattress was the worst mattress I have ever seen and I could fold it like a slice of bread.  Sitting on it was like sitting on a piece of cardboard.  It had no buoyancy at all and is long past its usable state.  Many things do not work correctly like the mini fridge and shower and although this has all been documented in an online inventory form, apart from an acknowledgement email, no further communication has been received as to if, and when any of these will be fixed.\n\nUrban Student Life:  The worst thing I have found about this place is the way the management of Urban Student Life is actually setup.  When Students contract with USL, they think they are contracting with USL and will receive a similar service to everyone else living there.  In fact, the rooms are split up and owned by seperate investors and depending on which investor owns your block, your experience can be very different.  For example, my daughter's room is actually owned and managed by cloudstudenthomes.co.uk.  She has this terrible mattress (and still does), but literally in the rooms next door (which are owned by different investors), they have newer comfortable mattresses (see pictures).  Another example is the Cloud Homes rooms did not have a Student Welcome Box (with a few drinks and snacks) or welcome information leaflet which was actually branded as USL.  The latter actually had very useful information like Fire Evacuation information and emergency numbers.  Other investor owned rooms did have this.  After phoning the office, we did secure a welcome box, but this should be provided by Cloud Homes as standard, especially as it contains Health and Safety information and as it is branded USL, which is who we thought we had contracted with.\n\nOn-Site Staff: I literally do not know what the staff are there for except to loan out the Vacuum cleaners and provide keys.  Any questions about the room or flats and you are met with the standard answer “You'll have to contact the investors”, in our case, Cloud Homes, who when you contact apologise for not being up to standard, but have failed to act so far.  No replacement mattress has come despite repeated emails and calls or any response on problematic items from the inventory.  I have actually had my daughter crying down the phone to me because she cannot sleep, due to the poor mattress.\n\nSo in summary for all you prospective students, foreign students and parents, I would not recommend this place and if you do come here, I would perform due. diligence about who you are actually contracting with and what differences you can expect as you'll be paying the same rent, but won't have the same experience!  Should the experience improve, I will gladly change my review to reflect any improvement.",

          "reviewText": "I dropped off my daughter here nearly 2 weeks ago and she was one of the first to move in.  This is my honest opinions as a Father.\n\nCleanliness on Arrival:  The whole unit was dirty with lots of dead insects, cobwebs and dust in the rooms and communal areas.\nState of Room: Terrible.  The mattress was the worst mattress I have ever seen and I could fold it like a slice of bread.  Sitting on it was like sitting on a piece of cardboard.  It had no buoyancy at all and is long past its usable state.  Many things do not work correctly like the mini fridge and shower and although this has all been documented in an online inventory form, apart from an acknowledgement email, no further communication has been received as to if, and when any of these will be fixed.\n\nUrban Student Life:  The worst thing I have found about this place is the way the management of Urban Student Life is actually setup.  When Students contract with USL, they think they are contracting with USL and will receive a similar service to everyone else living there.  In fact, the rooms are split up and owned by seperate investors and depending on which investor owns your block, your experience can be very different.

In addition when the showers were reopened they failed to put the water back on so I had to dress and pack up my stuff and go to the other shower block. Cleaning was done each morning between 10.30 and 12. I've never been on a site that takes that long especially with the number of staff they have. Also people still want to use the facilities at 10.30 so why they couldn't do it later. Also we saw one male site assistant walking along just in front of a female staff member and she was pushing all the gardening equipment in a wheelbarrow whilst he walked along empty handed.

The sauna and outdoor shower were incredible and the bushcraft lesson with Pat was so much fun. A proper dedicated family run business and all your hard work doesn’t go unnoticed. It was beautiful to see my daughter running wild and free without worrying about her safety, a real gift! Thank you 🤩",

Hot water for handwashing and washing up & plenty of drinking water. We didn't use the shower as only stayed for one night, but they are located in old horse trailers and are super cute.

The pitch was a long way from the car park so we had to make several long trips with wheelbarrows which wasn't ideal but once sorted we could relax. It's a bit of a pain packing away as you have to ferry stuff to the car and then repack to fit the tent in but it works.  The Compost toilets and solar powered showers seemed ok most of the time. It's just a case of catching the hot water. I think  it's  a bit pricey at £34 per night compared to other really scenic lovely small sites we have been to in Dorset and Devon at £20-£25 per night with  traditional facilities (toilet and shower blocks, etc) . Fire wood is £9 per bag compared to the £5 per bag we paid in Dorset but we had a fire 3 nights in a row.  Overall a nice weekend but it seems that 'off grid' is an expensive way to camp 😔.",

Owners are friendly and welcoming but also happy to let you crack on as you want. Only gripe is that the showers and toilets could do with some tlc and more frequent cleaning however, not an issue if you're staying for 3 to 4 days.  The site backs onto Blean nature reserve and forest and you can get lost for hours walking and has a good evening vibe when you return with the firepits and bbq's. Will definitely return again.",

A gas stove was also included to use, we brought our own camping kettle however there is one available to use in the little kitchenette. Wood or a disposable bbq was also available for a small fee which came in very handy for us. The facilities were clean and tidy and the showers came with a lovely view. The viewing deck was a nice little touch for watching the sunset, and the lights on the tents/shepherd huts and around camp made the night time magical for the children, the paddock is safe away from the main roads so it was safe for our children to run around play badminton and on the swings. The owner is very responsive and it was lovely to meet her mum on site, we will definitely be returning.",

It's a site with a few lovely elements to it, but in our opinion, there is definitely room for improvement.\n\nUpon driving up to the site there was very little signage to welcome you to the site, or to advise where to park, or check-in instructions. We only realised we were in the right place because there was a tent already in the field.  You cannot park next to your tent, or even unload the car in the camping field, but the owners have helpfully provided a selection of wheelbarrows. Luckily it's not a huge field to traipse all your stuff across.\n\nDuring our visit the whole site was waterlogged and this made it very difficult to pick a suitable pitch, and the only walk-way in and out of the site was like a pond and got increasingly worse with the foot traffic. Due to the lack of check in instructions, we just unloaded and set up camp where we wanted, however we later noticed a sign near the toilets which stated we should have contacted \"Alex\" before doing anything! There was no contact number for Alex, so not sure how we were meant to do that! There was also a list of site rules but these signs were at the furthest part of the site, which were only seen when using the toilet block.\n\nThe site itself is very peaceful, loads of birdsong throughout the day and very little passing traffic. There are 2 swing seats for all to use, and a treehouse/viewing platform up in the trees. The field next door was in full bloom which was a lovely sight, and it was less than 10mins to walk to the local pub, which did really delicious food! The toilet block and showers were very modern, flushing toilets and the showers looked out over the field. There is also a tree with items you can borrow, such as pots and pans, which we thought was a nice touch. The outdoor sink was great for washing up, but the indoor sink leaked onto the floor every time the water was run.\n\nWe were there for 3 nights and only once had any contact with someone, who we assumed was the owner - they didn't introduce themselves, nor did they offer any firewood etc - we sourced our own elsewhere.\n\nThere is a communal firepit in the middle of the site, but we used our own, next to our tent.\n\nThere are no bins on site; while we understand the reasons for this and Fleets Paddock's intention to be back-to-basics, there was nowhere for firepit or bbq ash to be disposed of, so a small bin would have been useful. There was also no sanitary waste bins in the toilet area.\n\nIn our opinion, there needs to be more signage, clearer instructions for check-in/setting up and more of a presence from the owners. A sprinkle of sawdust across the field or even just at the walkway, would have helped with the bogginess. Overall, it just feels a bit unfinished.",

I would of expected that this is washed after each visitors. Lakes fenced up and no chance of seeing it. Best pictures attached. No soap in one of the toilets for whole our stay. Neither shower gel in one of the showers. Tents so close and all facing main path so everyone can see you. It's very overlooked. Tents so close you can hear people's conversation. Overpriced stay and food. Yoga is not free at all. Coffee is not free at all. Would not stay again.",

Only a pond which you can not even see. Our tent was full with dead bugs. I would of expected some live nature but not a dead bugs. We just moved blanket and sand was all over the bedding. I would of expected that this is washed after each visitors. Lakes fenced up and no chance of seeing it. Best pictures attached. No soap in one of the toilets for whole our stay. Neither shower gel in one of the showers. Tents so close and all facing main path so everyone can see you. It's very overlooked. Tents so close you can hear people's conversation. Overpriced stay and food. Yoga is not free at all. Coffee is not free at all. Would not stay again.",

We played tennis and a few lawn games such a pétanque.\nThe large feild is a mix or wild and treated to allow a relaxed 'off grid' feel to reaching our elegantly decorated bell tent. Very smart in decor, we loved it.\n\nThe free bottles of water at the terrace bar and the golf ball lights around the terrace are a nice touch.\n\nNo need to bring food, drinks, blankets or even cosmetics for washing. It's all there for you and even the showers (lovely and hot btw) use products that help us look after the planet.\n\nThis place ticks all the boxes!\nWe'll be back when the sun is shining and cant wait.\n\nThanks Daniel, Clare, Talis, Claire, Lizzie and Jake for making us feel like part of the family Quaives XXx",

Check the ordnance survey map for footpaths before you set out - it's possible to get there using only a couple of very short bits of road without a footpaths, the rest is on good paths through farmland. Look for the path that crosses the A2, it goes through an underpass so no dangerous road crossing (returning from Bridge the footpath leaves the far edge of the recreation ground by the A2 and runs alongside it for a few hundred metres before going through the underpass.) The site is equipped with electricity, but no toilets, showers or waste disposal, but as long as you know this in advance it's fine. The field is flat with cut grass and the electricity outlets position around the edges. The road that runs along the side of the field is a bit of a rat run and cars do come through at a bit of a lick. At night you can hear traffic on the A2 in the distance, but you also get to hear owls so not all bad. The people that run the site are nice and helpful; they do not live on-site, but are easily available by phone. This site is a good place to stop if you are on the way to France or if you want to stay longer and explore a beautiful part of the world which is riddled with footpaths.",

Nice that bath towels were large full-sized ones and not the standard small size you often get at holiday parks. The main bathroom had a heated towel rail, but the en-suite had nothing,  could really have done with a couple of hooks on wall between door and shower just for hanging towels on to dry. The wardrobes in twin rooms only had 2 hangers.\n\nKitchen was mostly well stocked, I was able to prepare a birthday brunch for everyone.  Just a shame the glasses were all different shapes / sizes and there was only 3 mugs or you had to use a tea cup.\n\nWe used the washer dryer, but the door jammed and we couldn't get our clean clothes out. Reception didn't know what to do. We eventually googled and found an override lever by the filter. Was a bit stressful!\n\nOverall a nice stay, if weather had been nicer we'd have walked round the site but it poured all weekend.  We would definitely come back though.",
