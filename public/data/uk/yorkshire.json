Mold is visibly growing in the corners, the drains are clogged and overflowing, and the water pressure is laughably poor. You leave feeling dirtier than when you went in.\n\nThe toilets are just as bad – broken seats, tissue scattered across the floor, and sinks that are either blocked or covered in some mystery residue. It’s clear no one is checking or maintaining these facilities regularly. For a leisure centre that charges membership fees, the state of the hygiene here is an absolute disgrace.\n\nI honestly wouldn’t recommend using the bathrooms or showers here unless you want to risk catching something.

I’m very grateful to say I’ve  once been  pressured into signing up for PT (which has been an uncomfortable occurrence in past gyms) nor once been made to feel uncomfortable or out of place by either the staff or fellow facility users.\n\nThe gym, changing rooms, pool and showers are spotlessly clean and well maintained and organised. There’s always a friendly face or someone willing to help or answer any questions. I’ve recently started attending some of the classes which I’ve not been brave enough to do in other gyms: water aerobics, Pilates and today my first kettle bells class. Each class allows for a beginner friendly option and the instructors have been so supportive and encouraging.

The centre offers a variety of activities suitable for all ages, ensuring that everyone can find something fun to do.\n\nThe large pool was particularly impressive—spacious and well-maintained, providing ample room for swimming and relaxing. However, I did find the small pool to be a bit disappointing. It was colder than expected and not as clean as it could be, which detracted slightly from the overall experience.\n\nDespite this minor setback, the centre's positive aspects far outweighed the negatives. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and friendly place to swim.",

No communal changing so you either have to lock all your stuff up while you shower (faff) or leave it unattended in a cubicle, only one hook and no shelf in the showers, and the water comes out scalding hot. It’s actually ridiculous how hot that water is. Then it’s about a fifteen minute walk from the showers to the nearest mirror, so if you like to moisturise and comb your hair after you get out, again you’ve got to lock up your stuff, leave it unattended, or wait until you’re on your way out. Finally the lockers are just not big enough. I have to put my bag in sideways 😂\n\nIt’s a shame as this is my local centre and it has loads of potential… just these little things make it a bad place to swim.",

The 7:30 - 8:30 am Saturday and Sunday swims are supposed to be a lane swim with lanes to segregate swimmers of different abilities.  However the removal of 3 lane ropes renders most of the pool as a free for all.  And when the students come back and the pool gets busier then lane swimming will be a waste of time.  And bearing in mind some very fast swimmers use these sessions there could be some very bad collisions.  And to make matters worse, the already limited 1 hour swim (and that’s when swimmers are allowed in on time), has now being been shaved to 55 minutes, which is to enable the children’s swimming lessons to start earlier, bearing in mind these swimming lessons go on for several hours.  Another annoying aspect, particularly with the Saturday swim is that the end lane during the 1 adult swim is hired out for private lane hire / swimming lessons, mainly for young children, often just 1 child in the end lane, which happens to be the widest lane in the pool.  So pool space is already limited for the relatively time limited adult swim as it is.  All I can say is that management should seriously consider installing all the lane ropes again, reinstating it as a 1 hour session, with the pool roller shutter door open on time and incorporating the private lane hire into the children’s swimming lessons program.  Ideally the adult 1 hour swim should be extended to 90 mins, with a 7 am start time.",

The treadmill I used clearly showed its age—it reset itself twice during my run and even had an old-style iPod connector, which says a lot about how outdated some of the equipment is. While there were some brand new spin bikes, it seems not all machines have been upgraded.\n\nWe then went to the pool area and tried the steam room, but it had an awful, pungent smell that made it unpleasant to stay in. The sauna was also overcrowded, making it difficult to relax.\n\nFor a gym that charges £65 per month, I expected far better facilities and standards. The equipment needs investment and the steam room’s hygiene urgently needs attention. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this gym and won’t be returning.",

You do need to start up the sauna about 15 mins before but if you do it mid workout that's usually ideal. Good assortment of equipment, and usually available without having to wait. If I had a criticism, its the shower/taps take a while to heat up. Also please fix broken equipment quicker. But overall, very helpful staff and friendly gym!",

I went at just after 4pm and was quiet at first but by the time I left and hour or so later all the running machines were busy and the rest of the free weights and machines were busy.

The changing rooms are a bit more rough and ready but worked perfectly fine. There were some sliders available which was great as we forgot to bring our flipflops. Everyone inside the sauna was very respectful and Adrian who ran the reception was friendly and helpful. The cold plunge and cold showers very much worked as intended and there is a portaloo available too. Water was also provided outside the sauna for drinking and there were felt hats that could be used to stop your head getting too warm in the sauna. Given they've only just opened I'm excited to see this grow and for more to be developed for the business.",

This to me suggests the showers very hardly get used which in turn suggests the shower gel units haven't been filled a very long while. I did not see anyone cleaning, the whole time I was there. The play rooms were filthy with used condoms which I can only presume had been left from the previous day or earlier from the day visited. It is a shame that the big talking point throughout the reviews is about cleanliness and hygiene. I would like to visit again but thinking about the latter is putting me off for life 😕",

The whole place is off such a weird atmosphere everywhere you go from the changing rooms, gym and pool/sauna area.\n\nThe changing rooms are horrible and certain people in there make the simple task of getting changed feel very uncomfortable as it is very small. People behaving in there like it’s a 3rd world country from coughing and spitting to throwing rubbish all over. I feel sorry for the staff that have to clean it up.\n\nThe clientele in there are not what you’d expect from a high price, premium gym. Lots of wannabe gangsters who again make it feel very uncomfortable in there. The sauna area is a joke. There’s always a class on there so even if you go during the day your relaxing sauna/ jacuzzi session will be interrupted by crying children or, the swarm of people finishing the water aerobics class that seem to take over everything and think they own the place after their class.\n\nGym etiquette is some of the worst I have ever seen in a gym. Again the wannabe gangster behaviour carries on up there. Lots of seedy men and good luck finding any of the weights as it seems like it is normal here to get a piece of equipment out and never put it back.\n\nAs for the parking, this is something that you will see in lots of other reviews and yes it really is that bad. They have decided to extent the Hotel and have halved the size of the car park without any warning. There was no warning of this for new members and if I had known I wouldn’t have joined. Even though I only go during the day, it is still impossible to park and like mentioned in other reviews they are actively fining people not it a correct space - their answer to this is giving members access to another car park at the other side of the industrial estate that is also close to overflowing itself which means you have to park right at the other side of it meaning a minimum 5 min walk from there to the gym. This is highly inconvenient especially at this time of year, dark nights, dodgy people around.\n\nMy regret is not having a proper look around this gym before joining. If you are reading this review DO NOT join here. They will lock you into a contract and then you are forced to drag yourself to this hell hole in fear of wasting nearly £60 every month.",

The staff are always helpful if you ask, but otherwise let you get on with your training, which I appreciate.\n\nIt can get quite busy at times, especially around the cables and dumbbell area after 4-5pm. That's when the facilities themselves feel a little cramped, as I often have to squeeze past people when moving to the next machine. The green turf area is also difficult to use properly for lunges or the sled because of limited space.\n\nIf the gym ever decides to expand, I’d love to see a hack squat machine, seated leg curl, standing calf raise, machine ab crunch, and a larger area for walking lunges so at least one full set can be done without constantly turning around or navigating equipment and people in the way. While there are plenty of alternatives already, these machines are very popular and I’m sure many members would appreciate them.\n\nA few smaller things could also be improved, some of which i seen in other reviews:\n\n*Far too many members leave plates on equipment, dumbbells lying around, or weights mixed up on the racks. This has gotten noticeably worse over the past year as the gym has become busier. It’s disappointing to constantly have to put things away after others, and stricter enforcement of these rules would really help.\n\n*Some rubber handles are loose, oversized, or coming off and would benefit from being cut to size or glued back on.\n\n*Adding at least one more of the popular cable attachments (straight bar, EZ bar curl, and shoulder-width row handles) would ease waiting times.\n\n*The toilet showers have visible mould, which could do with a proper bleach clean.\n\n*Weekend opening times could be improved, as it would be great if the gym opened earlier in the mornings like it does on weekdays.\n\nOverall though, it’s a great gym that I really enjoy training at, and with a few tweaks it could be even better.",

It’s disappointing to constantly have to put things away after others, and stricter enforcement of these rules would really help.\n\n*Some rubber handles are loose, oversized, or coming off and would benefit from being cut to size or glued back on.\n\n*Adding at least one more of the popular cable attachments (straight bar, EZ bar curl, and shoulder-width row handles) would ease waiting times.\n\n*The toilet showers have visible mould, which could do with a proper bleach clean.\n\n*Weekend opening times could be improved, as it would be great if the gym opened earlier in the mornings like it does on weekdays.\n\nOverall though, it’s a great gym that I really enjoy training at, and with a few tweaks it could be even better.",

All that space and no sled pull, no curved treadmill, no air bike and no booty builder. The hack squat machine seems to be the least dated bit of equipment in there.

The cost of joining is reasonable and you can get add-ons for a bit extra! You can take classes for free, but they have to be booked through the app first! It's strongly recommended you have a padlock if using the lockers, as they don't self-lock!

My mate was going to join me, I think his truck fell into the onsite lake and we can’t find him",

This services is not a snap one so if your company use snap it will be no good . The staff in w h Smith were brilliant. Very friendly and just nice people. Makes all the difference after a long day . You've got your typical food places in there and a starbucks. Prices weren't to bad for a services. I would use this again as it was nice and quiet 🤫.",

That said, I can imagine on a warm summers day with more people sitting outside it may have an entirely different feeling to the place. But our visit, on this day, was just a bit meh. Long queue to get into the car park to find there were in fact lots of spaces but the layout meant people parking caused tailbacks. Three staff wearing hi vis, apparently there to assist with parking, standing doing nothing. Two on their phones, one standing with a sign stating Spaces Here but not holding it aloft meant no one could see it.  The bathrooms were wet and there were papers littered on the floor in the cubicle, with a wet seat and not in the best condition as a result. We’ve all been there, and even hourly checks would have struggled to keep the cloakrooms up to scratch on a wet busy day, and ultimately, it’s down to the users to make an effort. Visited the food shop and grabbed a burger meal (dry burger and bland fries)and staff were pretty indifferent.  The service station itself provided a service but it’s a splash and dash, not one I would want to take a break at, particularly compared with others on the same south to north road trip.",

There was a good sitting space behind the reception area and the bedrooms had fantastic heavy wood bunks and storage space below. The showers and bathroom space were also a pleasure to use. Thank you for having me and I hope to come again!",

The bed was a bit too hard for my comfort, which affected my sleep, but I appreciated that my bed was made and ready for me upon arrival. The hand towel in the bathroom and the number of showers available were great. However, I do think the cleanliness could be improved—particularly with the bedsheets and the fridge, which could use more regular cleaning.\nThe kitchen was spacious, well-equipped, and offered a good selection of tools and supplies. The staff at the reception were friendly and helpful, providing clear instructions during check-in. I really liked the art concept at the hostel—it gives the place a unique and creative vibe. With a few tweaks in cleanliness and upkeep, the overall experience could be even better and more welcoming.\nI’d definitely consider staying again!",

To be fair to him, I was quiet coming up and he did apologise profusely after ducking back in to get changed. He did also let two people sleep on the sofa's in reception.\n\nShower rooms are freezing as you can't close the windows. There was a door to the back of the house that was the main entry and exit point which was only secured by a four digit pin, which felt quite unsafe as its told to anyone who checks in. You do get a card for a discount at a local pub which was good.  Sheets were itchy - I slept in a sleeping bag with a coat over me.\n\nPlace is easy to find, and quite a short walk from the station and city centre.

If having a shared kitchen then sink is needed and tea towels.\n2. No internet so could not watch any tv from book in till leave.\n3. No little bottles of shampoo and shower gel like other places do.\n4. Only 2 towels couldn’t ask for more as no reception.\n5. Bad floor so constant dust and all you can hear are footsteps everywhere.\n6. And due to cheap thin walls could hear everyone talking .\n7.mattress solid and thin pillows and thin duvet .\n8. Shower after been used water would run down towards toilet\n\nAfter I rang about only the internet I was told I could either leave or have some back but not some back stuff in our bedroom was hanging of wall .  They need to redo every room",

After to do my booking and in the time for to go to the place (is difficult to call the place as a hotel) I received a SMS about the number of my room. Was the room 1... And was horrible, because is close to the door entrance to the place, close to the area for to use the microwave and other things. In the SMS I received the number to my room, the information about the self check in and the number of the safe that was the key to the front door and the room. If have Internet... Wi-Fi... Ok... But I don't received the password so I had to use my mobile data, which didn't help me much. The mat in front of the shower was damp and without a good smell. Bath towels were not completely dry. The room heater didn't work and the same as the heater for the towels. And around midnight, all the sockets in the room stopped working. I usually sleep late and so, to my surprise and sadness, I had to put my cell phone and laptop to charge where the microwave is. My room was number 1... Right in front of the area where the microwave is and until around 11 pm, I heard a lot of noise coming from that area. The cleanliness of the room was reasonable and when my key fell on the floor... When I lifted the mattress I realized that they hadn't cleaned under the bed in weeks. Deplorable. First and last time I went to this place, they should lower the price per night because it's not worth it. I come to Leeds twice a month to meet my girlfriend, who lives in a place that can't accommodate me, and so I stay in a hotel. I don't recommend this place to anyone! I add the picture to my cellphone and laptop charging close to the microwave and the TV... That without to work the energy sockets... Was off.",

There is a map of the site at the barrier and your name is by your pitch, simples. We had electric hook up for the camper so that was great. It was peaceful and the view was lovely. Yes, you are on a flight path for Leeds airport (I had seen this on a different review) it’s not constant seemed quite sporadic and to be honest having grown up on the Manchester airport flight path this didn’t bother me too much. The site faces south west-ish so if the weather is good then sunsets could be amazing. Ours was 50/50 due to cloud.\nFacilities onsite were great. We haven’t camped much but the wash station was one of the best we have encountered. It’s in a nice summerhouse type wooden building with two sinks and complementary dish cloths if you’ve forgotten your own. A fridge freezer for campers to use too. Great for the beverages and to replenish the essential ice blocks. The ablutions were exceptionally clean. The men’s had two urinals, two pans, a shower plus two sinks and a shaver point. From what I can gather the ladies had two pans and a shower with three sinks. Everything was clean and tidy.\nOverall very happy with our stay and would definitely consider this site if we were to visit anywhere else in that part of the county.",

Unfortunately, the facilities really need an upgrade and more frequent cleaning; rubbish in the shower block hasn’t moved in days. Quiet hours from 10 pm aren’t enforced and we were kept awake late, by noisy neighbours. Although advertised as dog-friendly, dogs are restricted and not allowed on the fields if matches are due on in the day, which makes exercising them stressful. A shame, as the location is fantastic and it could be a brilliant site with better management.",

This staff is the supervisor of the reception, now you can imagine how terrible the team is!\n\nThis is not the first I have been disappointed by this place. From the booking system which is unbelievably difficult to use, to the enquiries that no one cares and responses. Their higher office, the so called management team, literally has no management skills.\n\nNot even mention the “refer a friend and get one month free membership” thing. It was totally fake. You had to “refer” a friend and wait till someone contact you and start a membership for you, but actually no one will contact your friend ever, so your referral would never be successful. How interesting is it!\n\nNot only that, they always change the rules without notifying people and they don’t see people equally! They don’t allow people who have swimming MEMBERSHIP to use the MEMBERSHIP changing room. That makes no sense. They set this nonsense rule this morning, no email, no notification, no explanation, just suddenly applied. I was told I couldn’t use the changing room I always use before as one of the members. If you ask them what time the rule was set, they say “the other day”, what an answer!\n\nPlus if you decide to buy the membership, be careful! You will have to pay “the last month fee” at the very first. I had terrible experience today so I wanted to cancel my membership, but I’ve been told my membership will have to finish on the end of December. If not, my “last month membership” fee will not be refunded. What a two month notice period!\n\nThe only positive thing about this venue is the competition pool, although the 50m lane swim has been stopped for a long time. I have been swimming here for 7 months and have encountered so many problems. I've tolerated enough, I simply can't take it anymore.\n\nAVOID!",

Always put off swimming, but last month decided to get back into it.\n\nRachel and Levi were absolutely lovely. They gave me a tour of the centre and sat with me to go through my options, which was wonderful!\n\nEveryone is SO friendly. It's a fantastic community hub where everyone says hello and has a little chat.\n\nI only use the pool and sauna, so can't comment on the other facilities. The sauna is new and very nice.\n\nThe pool area is really good and kept clean. The only issues I have is that I dislike unisex changing rooms and the pool water is cloudy.  Plus the bottom of the pool looks like it needs a bit of a refresh.\n\nGood prices, great people and lots going on. I highly recommend Concord sports centre if you're looking to keep fit.",

It doesn't feel like a welcoming place if you're not part of a certain religious group. We were stared at the whole time by the other customers. We experienced homophobic comments from other women in the pool for simply being two women with short hair.\n\nWe left our swim session early as a result, wasting our money.\n\nThis feels harsh as it's not necessarily the fault of Zest themselves how their customers behave. But I advise that you should avoid if you're LGBT.\n\nThe pool was also extremely busy and unsuitable for actual swimming. It was full of people socialising or just splashing about, blocking room those who were trying to swim. This was a 16+ only session, so it wasn't even kids playing.\n\nThe changing room is also very cramped and difficult to navigate when busy. The whole place doesn't feel clean either.\n\nIt's a shame that my local pool doesn't feel welcoming to me.",

It’s overcrowded with women just standing and not swimming, you cannot do laps in this pool as a lot of people just mess around. Everytime I swam I could see chunks of brown substance floating around, hair everywhere as most of the women in the session did not wear a swim cap, and other unusual substances in the pool, it looks like it’s not cleaned enough. I’ve been here two times and both times the pool has been dirty despite me telling staff as such, it looks like it isn’t cleaned often. You also feel out of place and uninvited if your not a part of the community who attend often. The changing rooms are filthy, not a single cubicle is clean, I didn’t even go near the showers so can’t comment on that. I will not be going here again I hope the team can encourage regularly cleaning of the pool and for users to wear swim caps and respect pool clothing rules.",

The higher up the levels your child gets they seem to have on less classes. My oldest is in level 8 and this has proven very hard as they hardly do any classes for this stage and the teacher she had at first looked like he couldn’t be bothered on his phone and was constantly just telling them to do laps. Not the best. Luckily the teacher has now been changed. Changing rooms is so full people leave their clothes in the changing blocks rather than in the lockers, so then you struggle to get changed as there’s no space. There’s no where to watch your child once they go into the big pool unless you stand around a tiny window in the changing room with 3 other people. If you manage to get a space inside when they are in the small pool it’s good, if not there’s tables behind the window but you can’t see you child as you’ve just got a load of people’s backs and heads who managed to get a space sat inside. I’ve been coming here for this long for the convenience that’s it’s the closest one to my home not for any other reason.",

I had called ahead of time to check the training pool was a good temperature as my son doesn't like it too cold.\nThe receptionist was very helpful even telling me what degrees Celsius the pool would be.\nAs it was my first visit, I was given a parking permit to fill in and display in my car window. This was a lovely touch as I wasn't aware of the parking restrictions and the car park is much safer than the busy road the leisure centre is situation off.\nInside, the centre looked and smelled very clean. The toilets were fresh and well stocked with toilet paper and soap. The communal changing cubicles were spotless and very pleasant to use. There are also ample lockers of various sizes which just require a £1 to lock up and keep all your belongings safe whilst you swim.\nWhen we entered the main pool, there are showers before you enter and a balcony where you can put your towels if you prefer them by the pool for immediate access after your swim.\nIt was lovely to see a multitude of toys, floats and buoyancy aids in and around the teaching pool. My son took great pleasure in collecting all the toys and playing with them whilst in the pool and he said this sports centre is his favourite so far!\nWhen we left, at least 3 team members were vigorously scrubbing down the floors, lockers and walls with soapy water and you could tell that they took pride in their leisure centre and want it looking at its best.\n\nWELL DONE to all the team at Aston-cum-Aughton. My son and I will be back very soon, of that I have no doubt!!",

So even when it’s really busy you still have loads of space.\n\nThe annoying thing is that it takes ages to get things fixed when they break. The water machine broke earlier this year and was out for ages. Same with some machines. Also with the soap dispenser in the male bathroom. The male changing room toilet’s are quite unclean a lot of the time too.\n\nIn summary though, it is still a great gym and the people that go are friendly too, as are the staff.",

When confronted they act innocent. However if you’re a woman without self respect neither pride then visit after 9 solo.

I have been to high end gyms and low budget ones and always find that I have to wait about for certain machines but there are plenty of machines across 2 floors. There is also an app you can download to track your workouts, reps, calories, distance etc which is useful for people who have goals and targets. There is also a large variety of free weights. I can't say I saw any staff other than at reception but then I wasn't looking around for them either but the reception staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Changing rooms are large and clean, showers and toilets also clean and spacious. Lockers are available free of charge which is also a plus. Overall glad I joined and look forward to my next visit",

I have been to high end gyms and low budget ones and always find that I have to wait about for certain machines but there are plenty of machines across 2 floors. There is also an app you can download to track your workouts, reps, calories, distance etc which is useful for people who have goals and targets. There is also a large variety of free weights. I can't say I saw any staff other than at reception but then I wasn't looking around for them either but the reception staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Changing rooms are large and clean, showers and toilets also clean and spacious. Lockers are available free of charge which is also a plus. Overall glad I joined and look forward to my next visit",

          "reviewText": "I am writing this review to express my disappointment with the gym facilities that I recently visited. I purchased a day pass for £8.99 with the expectation that I would have access to the pool and sauna facilities until the gym's closing time, which I was informed was at 5 pm. However, upon arrival at 3:40 pm, I was informed that the pool and sauna were already closing at 4 pm.\n\nThis was highly frustrating, as the limited access to these facilities made the price of the day pass seem exorbitant, especially since I was not informed of these restrictions before purchasing the pass. I would have appreciated it if the gym had informed me of these limitations before my arrival, as it would have saved me the time and money spent on the day pass.\n\nMoreover, the early closure of these facilities means that the gym is not providing a comprehensive service to its customers, especially those who work or study late and would appreciate the opportunity to use the pool or sauna after work hours.\n\nOverall, my experience at the gym was highly disappointing, and I would not recommend this facility to anyone looking for a comprehensive gym experience. The early closure of facilities, combined with the high price of the day pass, makes this gym a poor value for money, and I will not be returning in the future.\n\nFurther comments from my partner, who is a membership holder at this gym:\n\nI'm sorry to say that this gym has many issues that need to be addressed. The equipment is in decline and often needs repair or replacing. Unfortunately, most machines take a long time to repair, sometimes 1-3 months. The pool has very limited availability, and the sauna and steam room are out of order 1/3 of the time.\n\nThe gym is very small and very expensive. Memberships are oversold for the capacity, leading to overcrowding during peak hours. It's a common sight to see all machines occupied, or even worse, out of order. People are often on top of each other, making it challenging to get a proper workout in.\n\nThe gym management has failed to keep up with the growing demand for the gym, and it's clear that they lack a long-term vision. If they had planned for expansion years ago, we wouldn't be dealing with such issues. Despite the high prices, the gym is generally dirty, and there's a lot of mould on the ceilings.\n\nIt's frustrating to see the gym constantly overselling memberships, and even worse, advertising new years deals despite already being at capacity.\n\nOverall, this gym is an absolute disgrace, and it's difficult to recommend it to anyone, especially for the extortionate amount. The staff are friendly, and there is good car parking, but those positives don't outweigh the many issues the gym has. It's clear that the gym needs better management, more space, and more attention to cleanliness and hygiene.",

There is a good volue of new equipment, with plenty of fixed benches, adjustable benches, squat racks, cables machines, free weights etc. The environment (Air conditioning, cleanliness, state of equipment) is comfortable to work out in. However, everything is brand new so I hope the uni will stay on top of cleaning and maintenance long-term. Seem to be plenty of lockers.

Always clean and tidy, reasonably priced, central so extremely accessible for everyone. The Staff are extremely helpful, the receptionists are always so welcoming answered every question I had and always had a smile on their faces! My kids absolutely love the swimming school and facilities! I took part in my first spin class this weekend after being talked into it by the receptionists and I can not recommend it enough! The facility is absolutely amazing and really adds to the experience! Lucy the instructor was amazing, so chatty and witty and really pushes you to your limits but also appreciates everyone’s diversity!\nThe changing facilities are also fantastic, always clean and the only gym I’ve been to that doesn’t seem to mysteriously run out of hot water at the end of the day!\nCan not recommend Nuffield enough! Amazing!",

For the past three months he’d been swimming confidently freestyle, backstroke and breaststroke and then suddenly a new instructor came in and put him back on a float. We were really taken aback, and my son was upset as it made him feel like he was starting again from level 0. It’s knocked his confidence completely.\n\nI spoke to reception, and their attitude was basically that they didn’t care. They said there was nothing they could do and that the regular instructor would check when she was back. When I asked if they kept any progress records, they said they only provide something at the end of term.\n\nIt’s honestly so frustrating. I’ve got no hope of seeing any real improvement at this rate. Best of luck,  I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone who genuinely wants their child to progress. Cheers.",

We arrived about 12pm on a Sunday and had parked at Broomhill as you are exempt from the parking restrictions on Sunday. It was a ten minute walk there as there is no parking. The lady on reception was very pleasant and said she could only accept a card payment which was £6.50 each. Westfield is only £4.85 each. The changing area and shower cubicles were clean. As we entered the pool we thought the water temperature was a little bit too warm compared to Westfield. The men who were swimming were very disrespectful to us and we found ourselves having to move out of their way. They had no consideration or manners towards other swimmers. At one point I saw something that resembled a blood soaked cotton wool floating. I can't say it was the best experience of swimming I've had recently. I'm unsure if I'll be returning.",

It is a prime example of what happens when public facilities are put into private hands. Membership cost up, service down.\n\nFor months now the lane swim schedule has been at best part time. This week for example there are no sessions Thurs-Sunday, at all. This has become standard. On the days when there are sessions, they are patchy, with gaps during the day, and often ending by 4pm. No explanation is ever given, complaints are responded to with a generic 'we're sorry you feel that way' response (as I'm sure this will be) and then ignored.\n\nIn addition to this, hygiene standards have plummeted and membership prices soared since Everyone Active took over (running the site for profit), from the charity Sheffield City Trust. The members changing rooms are mouldy and stale, with every single hair dryer broken. The showers are rarely cleaned, I've seen stains and dirt sit in the same spot on the shower block floor for weeks at a time. The yoga mats in the studio reek of stale sweat, and there is no antibacterial spray for wiping down. A loudly championed 'refurbishment' of the gym involved a rearrange, and the swapping out of broken equipment with already worn equipment shipped over from the Hillsborough site.\n\nWith respect to membership costs, the first thing that Everyone Active did on taking over the running of the site was to hike prices, and particularly spitefully, remove the discount rate for disabled people. To mark the one year anniversary of their running of the site prices have just been raised yet again without excuse or apology.\n\nAll this seems to be a common pattern with Everyone Active who appear to at least in part keep their sites profitable by slashing staff and services, particularly with the cleaning team, but I also suspect with lifeguard numbers. The current excuse in the case of Ponds Forge is that there is a problem with the leisure pool which has lead to swimming lessons being moved over to the main pool, causing cancellations. However, this is an excuse that Everyone Active have been using for months, whilst also cancelling swimming lessons, and often leaving the main pool half empty with neither taking place. At some point all physical problems become management problems.\n\nWhen Sheffield City Trust ran the site, it was not perfect, but they were a charity doing their best, and the general level of service was far above what it is now. Private for-profit companies do not deserve the leniency that we give to charities. They should step up their game, communicate with their members, improve as a matter of urgency, or lose their right to run the facility.\n\nPonds Forge could be so much, and yet, because of poor management and investment, it grows shabbier by the day.",

The cable connecting the display on the 2 air bikes is split, the display won't stay on, been like that for months! The glute/ham raise is missing the adjuster clip for, it's been missing for months. The staff have also started emailing members, threatening them with account suspension if they don't put weights back after use... I agree to some extent as some people are just lazy! But I put my weights back 99% of the time... Occasionally I'll forget, if I'm in a rush to get back to work for example... I forgot to put my weights back once this entire year and they emailed me threatening to suspend my account! Every member is going to be suspended if they keep it up, it's ridiculous!!!\n\nEdit (May 2023) - Downgraded to 3 stars. Having visited the gym frequently (4 times a week) since opening my opinion has changed. One of the vending machines is broken already, the entrance turnstiles have broken multiple times. There are already clips missing for the cable machines and barbells. The fire alarm on the entrance has been flashing \"error\" and beeping for weeks! I've come to  realise that the toilet facilities are way too small for a gym this size. There are not enough lockers downstairs and the staff care more about the silly \"no gym bags on the gym floor\" rule than they do about actual health & safety. There are always barbells and other equipment left in the middle of the gym floor (which I've tripped over or moved out of my workout area multiple times) yet the staff ignore it or walk around it. They don't seem to care about the gym. There is currently a chest fly machine that is broken and has been for over a week. There's a few clocks on the walls and they haven't been changed since the clocks went forward over a month ago, which I know isn't a big deal but it shows a lack of care and attention from the gym staff. The gym has only been open a few short months and it's already being neglected. It's sad really!\n\nOriginal review - Really impressed with the new Pure Gym. I went to the opening yesterday and had a look around then this morning I went for a proper workout. I was a member of the old Pure Gym (Nr. Tesco) which was a bit of a dump, but this one couldn't be further from a dump!\n\nEverything is brand new (I was worried they'd move some of the equipment from the old gym). There are 8 squat racks across the middle at the back, plus another 3 that doubles as bench press stations. The squat racks in the middle have solid platforms for squatting on one side, which is a welcome addition. They also have 2 sleds and Ski-erg machines (which I love!). There are a ton of DBs across the back wall with plenty of benches. There are also kettlebells, med. balls, and weighted bags... It has pretty much everything you can think of!\n\nThey have a large open area on the main floor for doing WODs or stretching, etc. There's also a studio with plenty of space and studio weights/barbells. The changing rooms and toilets are upstairs. As you can imagine, they are nice and new, let's hope they don't get ruined. There's also a cycle/spin studio upstairs with cool lighting, full of brand-new bikes.\n\nThe only issue with it being so big and having the toilets upstairs is that it's a bit of a mission if you're working out in the free weights area downstairs. I kid you not, from the squat racks to the toilets and back is about the length of a football pitch in total distance covered. Not ideal after heavy squats with jelly legs. I wish they had downstairs toilets.\n\nParking and lockers are plenty, plus they have the usual vending machines with snacks and shakes. They have mostly the same staff that were at the old Pure Gym. They're a nice friendly bunch.\n\nThe opening offer (£10.99 a month for 12 months) is an absolute bargain! Having such a nice gym makes me look forward to working out. Hopefully, it doesn't get ruined, please look after the gym people!",

Leisure pool has two big slides suitable for children 1m and above. Slides are nice and gentle and great for young kids and parents to go on with. Small baby pool and pirate ship with toddler slide. Lovely facilities around pool area and fantastic value for money. Would advise booking online in advance as slots quickly go. Swimming is 1hour per session.",

There were many like us hoping to have a proper swim, but there was only one very small section of the pool separated off for this (equivalent to a lane). The area for diving was bigger. This was a shame as the pool was starting to empty out but there were still a number of children in the areas that were deep enough to swim. It is a lovely setting and the pool was very refreshing, it is unheated. There are grassy areas where you can sit if you are planning to be there for a few hours. It is definitely aimed at families. It would be nice if Bradford Council set aside the last hour of opening for adult lane swims. The changing rooms are in serious need of a revamp - 3 showers, 2 sinks, 6 cubicles, dirty and wet everywhere. For £11.95 a swim, they should be much better than they are. Bizarrely we were asked twice to be quiet as there was a soundbath going on in the next room - this at the end of the evening when lots of people were showering (or queuing to shower!) and changing.",

Kids enjoyed it this is our 3rd time here as a big group. Its loads better this time around boards inbetween inflatables so bit easier to get round.\n\nOnly thing that lets it down a bit is the changing rooms and toilets. Alot of people were having to get changed outside trying to cover up with towels.\n\nIt is a very busy place which i get and maybe in peak times needs more staff on the cafe. We were queuing 25 minutes and there was no rush in them to serve people. We did do a big food and drink order which i had spoken to a few hours before we put it in so they had a little heads up. When i say big i mean 25 pizzas and chips.....by the way thd pizzas are so nice. This was really quick to be honest they did really well sorting this but the one thing that i thought was very rude.\n\nThere was a lady an oldish lady i said is there any chance we can get some paper plates she looked at me and said how many i went 50 she said oh no ide have to charge you for them i went but weve just put a massive order in. She was like right you can have them but i thought the way she had spoken to me was very rude and come on what a few plates when weve put loads of money in the till.\n\nOther than the lady at the cafe the place is great kids will love it the staff on the front are great. We will always go back",

I get that maintenence is a challenge in venues open long hours and that a jacuzzi relies on power and water which are not the best of bed fellows in terms of safety but it's dissapointing to be charged full entry when the facilities advertised are not available?  Even a complimentary return or discount for a future visit would have been a welcome gesture but it was not to be..\n\nAs Tuesday is a Naked day I was provided with a spa towel the size of a tea towel and a micro fibre \"shower towel\" which I didn't unroll (more on that later..) if Naked Day was an intimidation I'm not sure the flimsy feeling towel provided would have assured my confidence much,  but maybe there are different towels for non naked days?\n\nImmediately past the tiny reception is a compact locker room with similarly compact lockers.  Fine for my street clothes wallet phone and watch, but I was grateful I wasn't wearing a jacket or coat as it would have been quite the challenge.  Luckily I was in a car, and not lugging a work laptop around, as spacewise I would have been buggered.\n\nI know I'm no longer the prime customer, and nowhere near as athletic and agile as I once was but I'm quite \"British\" about shucking my kit off and I suspect at busier times dressing or undressing would entail a lot of unexpected contact (yes I know I paid my money for Bums and Willies fun but I'm the guy who always gets the unsavoury neighbour....)\n\nDownstairs the sauna cabin was on and working, if somewhat small? A bit like an old Northern train, it may have a given number of seats,  but unless you're a string bean or don't mind wedging yourself between sweaty relative strangers it would have similar capacity to a large family car?\n\nThe nearby toilet was passable but lacking in toilet paper when I arrived, and when I left, although thankfully I didn't need any.\n\nI found the out of use jacuzzi then noticed the stairs up.. And the promise of better things.. The upper floor is like most gay saunas a repository for sterling board, sheet ply, and 50 gallons of matt black with the pleasantly disorienting array of doors cubicles and alleyways.  Two \"video\" areas one smaller and less exposed, and the, larger with two tier benching and two doorways which made it feel strangely exposed? The assortment of glory hole cubicles was fine.. I liked the two elevated ones which allow the guy(s) on both sides to stand up.  There are two sling rooms but they looked to be suspended at an odd height? I know many young guys are much taller than my respectable 6'2“  but I have serious doubts about my ability to service any willing occupant without a step to stand on? Later I did see a couple of guys engaged in the act as the door was left open,  and it was definitely a precarious job on tiptoes.\n\nNow back to the shower towel provided on entry...  The shower area is long and narrow with access at the end  possibly not very big   I didn't find out because the entry point has a sign that made me grateful I didn't need to wash.\n\n\"Do not shit or douche in the showers\" 10/10 for plain English, 0/10 for appeal.",

Over the past couple of years this place has nose dived big time and it has NOTHING to do with the people coming through the doors. It is the place itself.\n\nThere is ALWAYS at least one of the facilities not working, it is now purely contactless entry, they charge £1 for each additional towel so if you want a shower and a fresh towel its going to cost you, and the worst thing is that the place is rundown and dirty bigtime. It needs shutting down and a massive revamp.\n\nEverything in the place is showing its age... The paintwork, the cubicles, the floor and even the outside area are just worn out and in big need of an overhaul.\n\nI understand economic downturn and finances not been as they once were, but a place like this needs to be kept on top of, especially given the nature of activities that go on here!\n\nIts no longer an inviting place.\n\nI think the biggest draw that keeps people coming back is the fact that the closest other saunas are in dewsbury or mansfield and not everyone can drive or get to them easily.\n\nSo in one respect, the owner is laughing all the way to the bank, but surely even he has noticed that his once extremely loyal customer base has dwindled massively!\n\nI fully respect the work that these places must need to keep going, but this sauna has to be the only one that only does the absolute bare minimum.\n\nHe needs to fix it or sell it and let somebody else run it that actually gives a monkeys.\n\nI would be embarrased to say i owned this sauna if i was the owner.\n\nI'm sorry for the massive thumbs down but it needed saying.\n\nDon't waste your time here, if you are able to get to another sauna i highly recommend giving this place a miss.",

The free tea and coffee was lovely too, and a nice thing to have in between activities. Only a couple things that could improve:\n\n- The selection of sandwiches wasn't great, and I don't know if it'd be worth it but an expansion of the food options would be nice. Also, the salad had a bit too much salt and could've maybe used a citrus or vinegar-based dressing instead?\n- The stairs to the upstairs area are very slippy, especially given that the showers are up there but the jacuzzi is downstairs. Some kind of rubber grip on the steps would go a long way to preventing accidents, perhaps especially important given the age of some of the attendees.\n\nDespite those points, I had a lovely time and I think I will go back.",

          "reviewText": "Been registered here since March and have decided I will not be renewing unless big changes are made.\nThe gym floor is fairly standard for commercial gyms with nothing that makes it bad or overly special. The pool is also pretty standard but they do close lanes at times for family swim and lessons. There is a hot room that I don’t overly use but also seems quite nice. The female changing rooms are extremely clean as they consistently have people cleaning them. The cafe is also quite nice with good selections of both smoothies and food.\nThe issues that I have with the gym are with the bits most important to me: the climbing wall and classes. The climbing wall is autobelay only and is actually a fairly decent height but has the most diabolical, god-awful setting I have genuinely ever seen. I have been to countless climbing centres and outdoor crags and have not experienced anything remotely close to how lazy and uninspiring the setting is here.\nI no longer go to the yoga classes here as there isn’t anything here for advanced students. The barre class is also overly beginner friendly. The main issue I have with classes is the reformer pilates classes. There is one non-introductory class a week for people only able to attend evening classes and it feels like the starting part of the hunger games trying to get into that class - which is such a shame because Tiff is a phenomenal instructor. There used to be four classes across two days in the evenings but these have been axed with no replacement despite always being full. If you want morning or middle of the day classes you won’t run into the same issue.\nAll in all this is a fine (but expensive) gym if you don’t care about classes or climbing but I would not recommend if you had any interest in climbing or doing evening classes.",

I didn’t mind what so ever paying the prices as the food was more than worth it but just make sure you’ve room for it 🤣 the plates are huge. All staff I encountered were polite and helpful.

          "reviewText": "First time visit to Onroute Truckstop Jcn 29 of the M1. First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.

          "reviewText": "First time visit to Onroute Truckstop Jcn 29 of the M1. First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything.

The kitchen table was filthy, the “continental breakfast” was a few jars of dusty cereals and one of the employees lingered in the kitchen all morning telling guests to do their washing up (one guest left a mug on the side and went upstairs, the employee called after the guest and spoke to him like a parent speaks to a child. The guest was popping upstairs to get changed and returning to the kitchen to have his drink. He had to explain himself, this is an unacceptable way to treat paying customers. Made me want to avoid the kitchen - the only common space available. Embarrassing.) I felt like I was being tested on my cleanliness in a hostel I felt dirty just being in. It was not relaxing at all and I felt like a socially anxious teenager again!! I felt like I was being watched! The room, however, was cleaned by the lovely employee who welcomed me on my first night (the reason this is not a 1 star review) and was a good level of cleanliness - I wish the rest of the place was as clean. The sheets were fresh and duvet was nice but the bed was so uncomfortable I barely slept and woke up with aching joints. No lockers to keep valuables in so I had to carry all my stuff around with me around the city. The room was also way to small for how many beds there were, which just made it awkward and absolutely no storage. Front door and bedroom only locked with a code which didn’t feel safe at all.",

We didn’t find our room key until the day of checkout (it was hidden IN the room) so all our stuff was available for the taking had someone chosen to steal it. (Which they didn’t, thankfully).\nReception was nice and friendly.\nParking was a nightmare as there was only one space at the hostel and my car’s handbrake wasn’t strong enough for the hill outside.\nThe rooms were not clean at all - maybe cleaners come and do the sheets but the carpets, toilet, showers etc all dirty from over time, and the whole building seems to be falling apart. I was just pleased that we had a private room as the bunk dorms looked depressing AF. Also it was way too hot in the night and I woke up several times in a sweat.\nBreakfast in the morning was also equally depressing with a selection of 3 cereals and some cheap coffee. I wasn’t expecting much but I think if you’re going to advertise “breakfast included” then it should consist of more ingredients - maybe something gluten-free? Or even some fresh fruit?!\nAll in all you get what you pay for I guess!",

I only stayed for a night so didn’t use the showers, the only thing I’d say is the water pressure wasn’t very strong so sometimes the toilets weren’t fully flushing (but the owners aren’t to know this unless being told). The views are incredible, pricing fairly reasonable, lovely pub and cafe at the bottom of the hill and the walk round langsett reservoir is stunning. Had a wonderful weekend, thank you! ☺️",

There's also a picnic area just out the campsite (literally 1 min walk away)  My kids love it here they just run up and down the fields for hrs. Lovely walks and views around. My Labrador loves it and always made to feel welcome by the owners.  So much nicer then a few campsites we have been to...literally feels so relaxed. One of if not our favourite campsites.

          "reviewText": "A Tale of Two Cities (Oxford and Bedford).\nWe booked for two nights midweek thinking it would be quieter.  However, around 5pm on the first night the camp was inundated with around 60 young people all on their DofE Gold.  Great to see and good for them, but they absolutely took over the field with about 30 two-man tents arranged in a horseshoe. That said, they were polite and well-behaved, observing the 10pm noise curfew.  Their teachers and DofE guides camped in the same area, and regularly looked in on the students.  This was a secondary school from Oxford.\nThe Oxford school left by 8am the next day and the field looked like it had when we arrived.  However, around 4pm we saw two more minibuses arrive, this time from a school in Bedford.  A different kettle of fish.  Again they camped right across the middle of the main field, but were sadly less societal than their next-but-one-county neighbours.  Teachers were largely absent, camping in a separate field. The 10pm noise curfew was therefore unpoliced, and the noise, football, rugby, music etc. continued until at least 11pm.\nWhy do I say all this ?  Not because I don't applaud youngsters embracing camping, not because I haven't been there myself, not because I begrudge youthful exuberance.  No, because I would have expected the campsite to advise and maybe forewarn families and couples that these two groups were incoming.  Clearly these group bookings were made some time ago, and so an advisory email or even a quick word from the onsite warden wouldn't have gone amiss when we checked in.\nAll that said, the campsite was fine. Lovely location and probably otherwise quiet and peaceful.  Couple of clean showers, couple of outdoor sheltered washing-up sinks, bit rocky and slopy in places, but was OK.  The hand dryers in the toilets though could likely be heard from Dronfield.  In hindsight, we should have chosen the top field as far as possible from the toilets and the Germans who decided to wash, rinse and generally clatter their pots and pans around at 11pm.",

We received such a warm welcome when we arrived, and the pitches are absolutely massive with beautifully maintained grass. The toilets and showers are spotless with loads of hot water, and there’s even a handy pot wash area on site. All in all, this place is fantastic, we had a brilliant stay and will definitely be coming back! Highly recommended.",

Loads of space to park but the payment was confusing, I paid for the hours I stayed at the pay machine but the barrier wouldn't open until I paid another £1, don't know why. The tech should be working better.\n\nThe water sport center has lots of activities. If you are into water stuff and swimming, pack a swimsuit. It was my first time and I will return with better preparation now that I know you can do your barbecue fresh on site.

Pitches are on hard standing . We found our motor mover very handy for getting into position , but I’m sure a more accomplished caravanner would find it Ok.\nThe gate to enter and exit the site is tight , but I didn’t have any trouble and I’m no expert driver . Having a second person to spot on the road is handy .\nAccessibility is otherwise very easy , off a quiet road with space to pass, off a main road . Fresh eggs are available from the owners .\nI’ve given 4 stars as it would be even better if it had a toilet/shower room , to reduce the frequency I needed to empty the cassette toilet, but I completely understand the reasons why the owners haven’t done this, and you get what you pay for .\nAt £16 a night, it’s very good value.",

There looks to be plenty of classes and the gym looks a decent size: yet to try. There are lovely little cafe area but the front desk for refreshments, pricing not too bad.",

I wasn't told that I couldn't use my \"Better\" token for the lockers like the other \"Better\" centres. After changing into our swim suits we realised our locker wouldn't work, I spent 5 mins trying many different lockers to then be told by a member of staff I have to go back outside and buy a locker token from the machine for 25p. I was half naked and only had my card. Thankfully she took pitty on me bless her and went and got me a token herself. This was very kind but it's not good that the receptionist didn't tell us when we arrived and told them it was our first time. They didn't even direct us as to where we needed to go, to get to the swimming changing area.\nEnergise is the closest centre to my house so I was wanting to join as a member for gym and swimming. Thanks God I visited yesterday before joining. Safe to say I won't be returning. Sadly the gym is really small the swimming changing area is not ideal and many areas taped off due to \"out if order\", lockers issue and the water being that cold I've woken up the next day feeling poorly! We didn't even stay the fully 60 mins because it was unbearable and couldn't stop shivering in the water.\nSorry guys. I just couldn't give a better review!\nNot worth the money at all!",

They also do aqua aerobics twice a week and swimming lessons and club stuff. Loads going on. It's an old building/pool with some great heritage and historic links to the city and it's workers/people. The pool and building are well looked after and are clean and the changing areas/showers/toilets are clean. You can book online and I think you can turn up and pay, if there are spaces. The staff are good. There are vending machines in the lobby for hot and cold drinks and snacks. There is enough parking at the venue but the car park is really tight with little space between the 2 rows and the spaces are tight.",

The pool is large (50 yards) and is (usually) split into 3 wide lanes, which gets rid of all the agro - its easy to over take/ be overtaken so there's no stressing about what pace you or others are doing. It's really bright and airy and the light dapples on the bottom of the pool as if you're swimming outside. The staff are all friendly and helpful, its well maintained and cleaned, it's clearly well valued and used by so many and there's a wide variety of people who go, from breast stroke chatters to competitive athletes and everyone in between and there's a generally friendly atmosphere between everyone.

          "reviewText": "Honest review of my personal experience at this Sports Center.\n\nI love gyms and visit almost on a daily basis. I appreciate a good gym culture that is cultivated by the management, staff and frequent gym visitors.\n\nI'll describe good and bad sides and a lot of it can be subjective due to the fact that I've not been able to compare this one to other gyms in the UK.\n\nPros:\n\n1. the students get a discount at the beginning of the academic year, I've paid around 230 pounds for 12 months, which is an okay deal. Slightly above average for \"gym only\" experience and when I say gym only I mean you get access only to the workout facilities and showers for free . No free group classes or pool, sauna, etc\n\n2. Close to Wentworth college campus. It's a five to ten minute walk from Wentworth collage and it has parking space.\n\n3.  They have two locker rooms, always half empty and you're normally alone in the mornings and late evenings from 8 to 10.\n\n4. Staff doesn't care about you or other visitors and that's a pro for me personally, but if you need their attention get prepared that they don't care about you and will ignore even when you drop the bars on yourself. They're busy ceat cheating.\n\nI'm afraid there are no other positive aspects of this gym.\n\nCons:\nThe biggest and the most stupid thing is that you have to buy an actual lock 🔐 to be able to close your locker. Hahah this was a brilliant marketing to milk money 🤑 from new comers who have no idea that the locks stay open unless you buy or bring a lock. The lock costed five pounds or something and you have to carry on a heavy lock all the time to be able to close the locker with your belongings. I've been to hundreds of gyms and it's the first time I see such thing.\n\n1. This might be a cultural and social behavior, but it's very very strange for me to see extremely bad hygiene of student visitors. You'd see a vomit on the locker room floor on a weekly basis.\n\na. A lot of students would take their shoes off while heavy lifting, and boy that stinks so bad. It's a rack of stinky socks you're smelling all around. It seems it's a norm as some would enter the gym without sports shoes on or completely dirty covered in mud.\n\nb. Big issue with bags and clothes of visitors thrown all over. Despite the notice , a lot of people would \"make their spots\" at the platforms by throwing up their clothes. This is extremely unhygienic and uncomfortable for me personally to navigate.\n\nc. most of the people would keep the equipment vacant for minutes, some would stay for an hour making certain equipment unacceptable. They would chat with others and trainers for minutes and when you try to approach they would say it's busy.\n\nd. Overall visitors tend to be very unhygienic when it comes to personal hygiene. No one takes a shower after the workout which is strange for me, I couldn't care less, but this speaks volumes about the personal hygiene of visitors.\n\ne. in Europe you'd have a first aid box on a visible spot. I couldn't spot one there and when I tore my finger I had to manage my bleeding finger myself.\n\nf. You can't access the gym on Sunday morning if you're heterosexual male , because apparently there are hours for non binary people 😁 how do they check if someone is a non binary ? Apparently there were females working out only. Very strange and artificial agenda.\n\ng. from time to time they would randomly approach you to check the blue entry bracelet. It's really strange because you do enter the gym by tapping the bracelet on the entry to the building and then on the entry to the actual gym, why they approach you to check again is extremely invasive.\n\nh. you can't move your shower and the water is directed to one angle only. Some showers are ok the others are bad with water temp and flow.\n\nI. sometimes they would forget to turn the music on and you'd workout in absolute silence for an hour\n\nj. If you go there on a daily basis you'd notice that the same playlist is being played on repeat\n\nk. during the week big sports groups would occupy the gym giving almost no access to equipment.",

          "reviewText": "Honest review of my personal experience at this Sports Center.\n\nI love gyms and visit almost on a daily basis. I appreciate a good gym culture that is cultivated by the management, staff and frequent gym visitors.\n\nI'll describe good and bad sides and a lot of it can be subjective due to the fact that I've not been able to compare this one to other gyms in the UK.\n\nPros:\n\n1. the students get a discount at the beginning of the academic year, I've paid around 230 pounds for 12 months, which is an okay deal. Slightly above average for \"gym only\" experience and when I say gym only I mean you get access only to the workout facilities and showers for free . No free group classes or pool, sauna, etc\n\n2. Close to Wentworth college campus. It's a five to ten minute walk from Wentworth collage and it has parking space.\n\n3.  They have two locker rooms, always half empty and you're normally alone in the mornings and late evenings from 8 to 10.\n\n4. Staff doesn't care about you or other visitors and that's a pro for me personally, but if you need their attention get prepared that they don't care about you and will ignore even when you drop the bars on yourself. They're busy ceat cheating.\n\nI'm afraid there are no other positive aspects of this gym.\n\nCons:\nThe biggest and the most stupid thing is that you have to buy an actual lock 🔐 to be able to close your locker. Hahah this was a brilliant marketing to milk money 🤑 from new comers who have no idea that the locks stay open unless you buy or bring a lock. The lock costed five pounds or something and you have to carry on a heavy lock all the time to be able to close the locker with your belongings. I've been to hundreds of gyms and it's the first time I see such thing.\n\n1. This might be a cultural and social behavior, but it's very very strange for me to see extremely bad hygiene of student visitors. You'd see a vomit on the locker room floor on a weekly basis.\n\na. A lot of students would take their shoes off while heavy lifting, and boy that stinks so bad. It's a rack of stinky socks you're smelling all around. It seems it's a norm as some would enter the gym without sports shoes on or completely dirty covered in mud.\n\nb. Big issue with bags and clothes of visitors thrown all over. Despite the notice , a lot of people would \"make their spots\" at the platforms by throwing up their clothes. This is extremely unhygienic and uncomfortable for me personally to navigate.\n\nc. most of the people would keep the equipment vacant for minutes, some would stay for an hour making certain equipment unacceptable. They would chat with others and trainers for minutes and when you try to approach they would say it's busy.\n\nd. Overall visitors tend to be very unhygienic when it comes to personal hygiene. No one takes a shower after the workout which is strange for me, I couldn't care less, but this speaks volumes about the personal hygiene of visitors.\n\ne. in Europe you'd have a first aid box on a visible spot. I couldn't spot one there and when I tore my finger I had to manage my bleeding finger myself.\n\nf. You can't access the gym on Sunday morning if you're heterosexual male , because apparently there are hours for non binary people 😁 how do they check if someone is a non binary ? Apparently there were females working out only. Very strange and artificial agenda.\n\ng. from time to time they would randomly approach you to check the blue entry bracelet. It's really strange because you do enter the gym by tapping the bracelet on the entry to the building and then on the entry to the actual gym, why they approach you to check again is extremely invasive.\n\nh. you can't move your shower and the water is directed to one angle only. Some showers are ok the others are bad with water temp and flow.\n\nI. sometimes they would forget to turn the music on and you'd workout in absolute silence for an hour\n\nj. If you go there on a daily basis you'd notice that the same playlist is being played on repeat\n\nk. during the week big sports groups would occupy the gym giving almost no access to equipment.",

Changing rooms very clean and spacious.\n\nWe had lunch in the cafe as part of the spa package. Limited choice of soup, jacket potatoes or avocado and eggs on toast but very delicious and something for everyone. Seating arrangement a bit unusual as more like a cafeteria looking out onto car park but modern and clean.\n\nMassage treatments lengthy and relaxing and dual bed appointment. Swedish back, back and scalp message to die for! Relaxation room with heated beds was definitely our favourite room!\n\nIgnore the negative comments, it is more about having unrealistic expectations.

My locker wouldn't open and I was forced to walk out into the reception area in my swim shorts dripping wet, then proceeded to wait for 15 mins for no one to attend the changing room as the only male member of staff was in a meeting. Eventually got the locker opened (the lock had seized), then when I complained that they'd just left me there shivering, the manager (as rude as expected) stated that they'd done everything they could.. also said they sent someone to help but I must have sorted it by then, I actually saw the guy come in and it was about 20-25 mins after I'd originally raised the fact that my belongings were stuck in the locker. Honestly would have usually just let it go but I'd just joined this gym and expected a bit better service for the price they charge. So I decided to quit immediately, and in the stereotypical big gym criminal behaviour, they want more money from me, even though I'd paid for the month up front! Get lost lol!",

A whole lot of kit packed into a small but perfectly formed space, geared primarily to strength training but with a reasonable selection of cardio machines. Equipment is of various ages but everything I wanted to use was in good nick, save for the rowing machine which has seen better days and needs its sensor replacing. Clientele mainly blokes but of varying ages and builds - I'm not exactly massive but did not feel out of place. Staff friendly. Day pass and weekly membership prices for those of us just visiting were reasonable.\n\nGents changing room and showers, upstairs on the first floor, were nice and clean, which is always the main thing, but the main door opens straight out onto the stairwell (from which most of the room is visible) and the doors to the shower stalls are just inside said changing room entrance. You therefore need, unless you're possessed of a devil may care attitude to nudity, to be very careful not to flash passers by, bearing in mind that the ladies' facilities are located a little further down the landing. The showers themselves need a little maintenance: the first one I tried was basically a tap rather than a spray; the second had no time delay on the push button which meant it had to be held down continuously to work - a manageable nuisance whilst you're facing it, but resulting in contortions when you're wanting to give your back and arse a proper wash.\n\nThe gripes aside, however, a good, clean and well equipped gym which seems to be run and used by the right kind of people. Would give 4.5 stars if the rating were available.",

When I was leaving and returned he said nothing, he was generally quite aggressive. I don't know what his problem was.

There is also a build up on the walls\nIn the shower from fat and sweat which is disgusting and needs to be cleaned a lot more often , and definitely a lot more thoroughly.The sauna could also do with a much more thorough clean as someone is definitely going to get ringworm or something with all the bodily fluids and sweat in there that’s building up. I’m not one to usually complain but basic hygiene shouldn’t have to be asked for when I’m paying £22/month for a membership.",

The changing rooms are spotlessly clean, the lighting is excellent, and there’s an impressive range of equipment. With plenty of machines, spare accessories for cable setups, and multiple dumbbells of each weight, you’re never left waiting. The resistance machines, including top-quality Hammer Strength gear, are a standout.\n\nThe gym is open 24/7, making it incredibly convenient for any schedule. The staff are friendly, approachable, and always willing to help. Hygiene is a priority, with constant cleaning keeping the facility pristine. The music selection keeps the energy high, creating a motivating atmosphere. JD Gyms York has set a new standard for what a gym should be!",

My two complaints would be they let way too many kids in and should be checking their ages.  I have seen masses under 16 they look about 12! And the showers could be warmer. Oh can we get a few more wipes dotted about the gym too especially the bottom floor. But very happy all round. Its like a treat to myself every time I go. Good staff too!",

I feel like the guy who owns ultraflex is too busy now making the other ultraflex gyms around the country/world bigger & better where the York one has been left behind & abandoned - a few of equipment/machines been out of order for months! A few Members who think they own the rack area where you do deadlifts etc are dumping & leaving crap in the shelving so other members can’t put their stuff in there. The locker area is a mess with broken lockers.. was a notice a few weeks ago saying something about lockers been removed but they have been taking down and the broken lockers remain..  the boxing area is a real joke its in the way of everyone trying to get to the changing rooms! It’s also quite intimidating when you are working out near them It’s too close to the smith machines as well  which are now both squashed  together in a corner next to a fire exit  making it unsafe - the Pendulum is also crammed in there too  (which is now broken) If someone is on the Smith machine, next to the fire exit doing hip thrust someone is on the other smith machine doing chest it makes you feel like a plate could fall on their head making it feel unsafe,  - only one hack machine so everyone is fighting over it.. its starting to turn into a more of a student gym than a bodybuilding gym!.. the car park is a joke.. especially now one member has their own parking space, which is ridiculous!!  Behind the reception area looks like a dumping ground the posing/sunbeds rooms are really bad now wasn’t before when it got moved - changing rooms and toilets are dirty  - It’s a really shame because York ultraflex use to be the best gym in York now with the JD gym opened makes it looking old and battered!  I visited the Leeds Ultraflex recently it was 100% times better probably be worth the drive to Leeds :(",

The family fun time with all the floats was great for the kids, but other swim sessions allow for laps if that's your thing. There are tables and chairs around the pool, and you can take in food and drink for picknicks and snacks (no glass or alcohol though!). Each session is around 1hr 45 and with numbers being controlled, doesn't get too overcrowded. The staff are friendly, the pool well maintained and a good temperature once you're in. We had a great day out! Would highly recommend - especially with a little tub of Yorkshire ice cream from the tuck shop after! 😁 The changing rooms could do with an upgrade which they're currently fundraising for.

There was plenty of space around the edge for towels and picnics and the water was clean and refreshing. Some areas were shallow, while others reached up to 12ft, offering something for everyone.\n\nFacilities were clean and the atmosphere was welcoming for all ages. There are also three adult-only lakes for those wanting a quieter experience. The lake bed has a clay, squidgy feel, so swimming socks might be a good idea.\n\nOverall, a fun, affordable day out – we’ll definitely be back!",

We turned up at 09:45 and stayed until 1400, the Q lake was super clean and facilities - shower, toilets and changing rooms all well kept too. We stopped off at the cafe on our way back to the car and had pizza and chips - delicious!!! Food was fresh and tasted yummy!\n\nNext time we visit we will most likely camp over as well to make a weekend of it. We will be back!!! Thanks for a great experience Pool Bridge Farm.",

When we arrived we were initially taken back by the number of people however when we got onto the campsite the pitches were spread out and quiet with the added bonus of the fire pits being already on the field free to use! The swimming was out of this world! I’ve never been wild swimming before so was slightly apprehensive but it was a truly amazing experience, surprisingly the pools adult only pools were quiet and relaxing the horseshoe was our favourite (slightly warmer than the Monet lake) but the Monet was beautiful still to swim amongst the water Lillie’s! We will definately return here in the future! The only negotiate would be the shower weren’t as spotless as other campsites but I think this is more due to the guests not cleaning up after themselves with the squeegee provided",

Faultless experience, clean, hot sauna and perfectly located on a private lake reserved just for sauna users (so not too busy). Sauna came with a vestibule which was great for hanging towels etc. Lovely cafe for a brew afterwards. Would be good to add the option of aromatherapy oils to buy to enhance the steam. Cant wait to return!",

Mid May and not a sunny day so we ventured into the water with some trepidation. Although it was cold once we started swimming the feeling of being cold was soon replaced by the joy of swimming in such beautiful surroundings. The farm enjoys ample parking facilities, toilets and changing rooms, sauna cabins and a very welcome cafe where hot food and drinks along with cakes are served at reasonable prices. We had a great time and will certainly return.",

I was nervous about using the brush thinking it had the potential to scratch/swirl and that would show on the carbon fibre roof. But I can't see any and it has a great shine along with the rest of the car. If going again I'd maybe take a wash mit to avoid the brush. Oh and there wasn't a separate/dedicated wheel tool.",

          "reviewText": "North American Traveller Review. As I say in other reviews, if you’re from NA you will need to get used to the incredibly small dimensions of any rental accommodation in the UK. This is no different. However, having said that - the rental was clean, well suited and very nice. Quiet at night as well. We could see the Wall from our backyard.  Size-wise, our suitcases were in the living room because there was no room for them in the bedroom. The only table to eat at was in the glassed-in conservatory at the back because the kitchen was so small even 2 people couldn’t fit. Again, however, this is normal and not specific to this unit but you should be aware and plan accordingly. The people at the corporation operating the rental were uniformly pleasant and helpful. The unit comes with a book of Operating Instructions. Which is absolutely required. For example, in NA if you wish to use the broiler on the oven you turn a labelled dial to Broil. Done. But in order to do the same thing here it required the manipulation of a Byzantine series of 3 dials including symbols and numbers and colours that had to be exactly correct, with no language on the oven itself. Guessing how to do this would have been hilariously impossible without the instructions. Also, from a NA traveller perspective oddities abound. There is a washing machine for clothing - but no dryer. The bathroom sink hot and cold are separate spouts so you cannot wash your hands in warm water - it’s either cold or very hot - take a choice. There is no mirror over the bathroom sink so when shaving or putting on woman’s makeup - you have to guess. You can’t just turn on a radiator for heat, the thermostat on the wall needs to be turned up first to above the current room temperature and then the radiators will work if they, in turn, are turned up. No issues per se, but it does add a layer we are not used to after a long day. Having said all of this no complaints. Very nice spot. Nice helpful people. Clean and tidy. Enjoyable.",

The location is fine but not great as it's a bit of a walk relative to both the train station and the city, and there isn't much nearby apart from a corner shop, but there is a bus stop just outside (though the traffic at York meant it was not much faster than walking...).\n\nThe 4-bed dorm and the ensuite were fairly spacious, though no soap in the shower is a nitpick. Only one extension with 4 sockets tied to a bunk pole for all 4 of us did feel a bit odd, I have to assume the building was not meant to be a hostel and not properly converted. Another sign was the desk and chair, which is nice to have in and of itself, but no socket to use is a big oversight. Comfort was fine though I would say. One \"luxury\" missing was privacy curtains, so you are at the mercy of your roommates' manners. In terms of facilities, there was also a lounge, quite large kitchen, a pay-to-use laundry, and a bar, though I didn't use any of those so again can't say much.",

The location (a short walk to the village centre) is great, the facilities, including the kitchen, shower rooms, eating and lounge areas have everything you need and are kept clean thoroughly. The camping area is a small, flat garden that fits 6-8 good sized tents. There are picnic tables and benches in the camping area so if you're camping you don't need to bring any tables or camping chairs.The staff were all really friendly and hard working. Helmsley itself is absolutely beautiful and we will definitely be back to this gem of a place.",

Me and my wife had a premium room, which was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the en-suite was lovely with a walk in showers and decent sized bath. We could hear other guests walk by our room but it was very rare and everyone there was respectful. You get tea and coffee and milk etc each day. All in all a fantastic place to stay.\n\nWould definitely recommend 👌",

Large spacious hardstanding pitches with small hedges in between for privacy. A very helpful, knowledgable gentleman checked us in and gave us lots of information. Amazing, immaculate toilet/shower block. Bus stop outside to get into York (£3 each adult) and we got Ubers back (no more than £8.00). Excellent site!!",

One of them appears to be out doing everything from vehicle marshalling, giving advice and helping folks on their pitches. All round solid bloke.\n\nFacilities clean all the time. Shower block feels like a sauna and could do with a few extra windows. Bins are a pain, giant ones at the entrance and none across the site. Had to help an elderly couple who couldn’t lift the industrial bin lids! This needs a rethink. One size doesn’t fit all regardless of environmental targets and cost saving.\n\nPark and ride is nearby which is excellent along with M&S, Sainsbury’s etc. Will be back next year, with my roll of black bin bags.",

Toilets and showers were superb, with each shower rooms containing shower, toilet, sink, hand dryer and pull down seat. Small shop on site was handy as I forgot my hairbrush.\n\nThere are codes to access the site and the showers, toilets, sinks and laundry rooms.

Not a great start.\n\nOnce we found the actual campsite, there was no one there to great us but as there was some builders doing work to the house, I asked if anyone was around to help us set up only to be told there was no one there. The builder kindly helped me by ringing the owner as our name wasn’t on the notice board at the entrance of the site showing which was our pitch. The builder also showed me where to find the, very dirty, toilets, shower & pot washing building. There was no indication about where the water was so we eventually found a water connector but had to drive slightly onto the grass to connect. Whilst we were filling up with water, we presume the owner returned (he never actually introduced himself) & promptly told us off for parking on the grass, indicating we should have used the hose reel by the house (this was being used by the builders & covered in concrete & dust). There were no signs to inform us of this & as no one was around so we just did the best we could.\n\nThe toilet block was filthy. The toilet was dirty when we arrived & was never cleaned whilst we were there. There was hair & dirt in the shower room. The second toilet was in the same room as the pot washing sink which is not hygienic to say the least, especially as the on-site builders were also using the toilet facilities. It was so dirty, I refused to use the shower or toilet. The bin in the toilet was full, had empty cans of pop in & wasn’t emptied over the 2 nights we were there.\n\nWe paid £30 per night which was way over what I would have been prepared to pay if I had known what it is actually like. Have stayed on far nicer sites for much less money. Think it’s fair to say we will not be returning!",

It's impossible to wash long hair under it; it takes three times as long and you freeze. On top of that, the cubicle was extremely small (and I'm a slim person). There was nowhere to put your things—in theory, there was a dirty folding stool, but unfortunately one can't squeeze in next to the unfolded stool.

The WiFi is rubbish and we couldn't even receive it's signal. Hard standings are almost level. Very clean shower block. Taxis available at special price into York. If you want to catch the bus to York then bus stop is a bit of a walk across two big busy roads. The nearest pub is just over a mile walk away down a narrow road with mostly no path so beware of fast coming cars. The pub is really nice but the food wasn't nice and not cheap. See my other review at the Nags Head. Overall the campsite was okay but location wasn't best. You can hear the traffic most of the time.",

Main critique is they advertise the bar, it only opens if busy!  The Flaxton Radio always on in the shower block always saying ‘no need to go hungry at Flaxton Meadows’  no food available!  As bar closed.  We stayed three nights.  Like I said great site and will recommend it, But please bring the radio up to date as it’s not accurate",

Mostly full all weekend. York races and BH weekend. £30 per night which is much cheaper than most other places around York. One toilet and shower room which was simple but practical. A chair for clothes would have been useful. Grey and fresh water sites fine. Toilet emptying was rather basic and needed a bucket of water to dispose of the waste properly. 10-12 mins walk to Monks Cross Park & Ride and retail park with shops and supermarkets etc. Bus £3.90 for adult day return into the city. Quick and easy. Walk is a 35-40 mins flat route. Overall a great stop and would definitely use it again over the usual expensive sites in York.",

It had only been open 3 weeks at that time, but the owners were so professional and welcoming, you would have thought they had been open for years.  All the pitches have been well thought out, all close to the amenity block and great sizes.  Even the smallest will accommodate most size tents.  Tents are in a separate section of the site, each pitch has EHU which is metered but at a very reasonable rate.  There is also a water tap accessible to every pitch.  The amenity block has great showers and loos, very clean, also disabled facilities and even a dog washing facility.  Also available is a washing machine which is £2 per load which includes washing powder.  These owners have literally thought of every detail.  I was camping on my own here but met some lovely people and felt very safe here.  Will definitely be coming back next season as still have lots of places to see and do in the area.  Thank you Peter and Gaynor for a lovely stay. x",

The pricing is very reasonable—especially for students—considering everything that’s included.\n\nHowever, I do wish the gym opened earlier, around 5:30 or at least 6:00 AM. That would be ideal for students like me who want to work out early, have enough time to get ready, and then head to college.\n\nAnother issue is that some machines take ages to get repaired. For example, the leg machine is often broken, and since there aren’t many leg machines available, you have to get creative—using things like the medicine ball to train your legs.\n\nThere’s also a large red rack in the middle of the gym that takes up a lot of space. It doesn’t seem to serve much purpose, so it would be great if they could remove it and replace it with more useful equipment. Adding a fly machine and more leg machines would help—especially so there are backups in case one breaks down.\n\nAlso, the ground area where you do the bench press has a slight gradient and is slippery, so the bench tends to slip while you’re using it. The benches themselves are fine—it’s just the surface they’re placed on that causes problems. Because of this, it’s hard to maintain proper alignment, which affects your form and muscle activation.\n\nThat said, the staff are really lovely—super friendly and helpful, although sometimes they can be a bit too picky. I also wish the climbing wall was free to use, especially if you want to go all the way up, as there seems to be a charge every time you use it.\n\nAll in all, aside from these issues, I think the gym is great. I’d give it a 3.5 out of 5 based on my experience",

One thing I don’t understand is why the ladies swim sessions on Fridays are not allowed in at least 15 minutes before swim time. They only let you in 5 minutes before. They talk about child protection as there’s a parent and kids session before but when these parents and children are still in the changing rooms, how does this make sense? Ladies toilets are filthy. They could do a good job with scrubbing the showers and tiles and everywhere in the changing rooms. However, as mentioned it’s a decent pool and most of the staff are really nice and it’s conveniently located and the sessions are perfectly timed and therefore can’t fault them on that.",

Steam room and sauna could do with fixing but told they won’t. Never had time to use them in the past but would do now.\n\nThe classes used to be great and varied but now just the same old classes. I attend quite a few of them and the teachers need to mix them up every few weeks like they used to years ago but they don’t. Plus, if it’s an hour’s class, make it an hour and not 50-55 minutes.\n\nGym members take the mickey by keeping permanent lockers and never clearing out every visit. I don’t think the staff care to check. Speaking of the staff, Julie is lovely and I hope she reads this and listens to the feedback. Over the years there’s been some stand out staff but they eventually leave, including the class instructors. Apart from Lucy and Michael, I don’t find the other staff friendly. They just stand and chat with the young lads all day!\n\nThe car park needs sorting out, too many pot holes. Kents need to tell the local children to keep out for the safety of themselves and of the gym members.\n\nI know I’ve generally given negative feedback but the positives are what remained in the past. I do like this gym overall as I’m clinging onto what it used to be.",

There are often “out of order” signs on equipment and sometimes you get set up just to find it doesn’t work, like the cable row. The weights are also not correctly calibrated on the pulleys, meaning you need to precariously add free plates to the stack. Weights often aren’t put away by other clientele (I appreciate this isn’t the fault of the gym, there are plenty of signs up about putting things back) and the ceiling drips water.\nThere is a clear level of care from management, they’re always trying to improve areas and a new mens changing room has just been put in, but it’s the basics that are frustrating.\nAt £40 a month it’s not a cheap gym either, and these issues are inexcusable. If it wasn’t so local and open 24 hours, I’d likely go to a different gym in the area.\nIf you live in the Shipley/ Saltaire area, this is probably the best gym in the area, but I’d like to see a lot more attention given to the equipment.",

In turn my confidence around body image has also improved. Massive shout out to Ali’s Circuit Class, I always feel ready to take on any challenges the week presents after experiencing his class, if you really want to push yourself, he is your man!\nMonthly membership price is very reasonable too. If you’re on the fence about joining this gym, they even offer free day passes for you come experience it for yourself. Give it them a try, I did and now I'm addicted Club Energy is my happy place.

I had classes at uni every morning or working part-time but they were hosting parties every night. I asked them nicely for one month to stop but they didn't care. Then I reached out to the reception about this and they told me to call security. I called it one time , they just stop for the night and then next night they were partying again. Called second time same situation. And then after I called the 3'rd time they got angry and came and knocked aggressively at my door 5 times in a row. I called security again because of that and when he came they were fighting and shouting at the security guy for 1 hour. After this in the morning I went to the reception as soon as they opened. After all this, all they did was giving them a phonecall. I asked to be moved because I had enough and after that night I also didn't feel safe to live there anymore. And they didn't want to move me because the only available room was one that was more expensive than the one I had. I found that very unprofessional. They keep the logs of the times security goes to someone. They should've given a phonecall after the very first time the security was called not when the situation gets aggressive. Also the contract itself mentions that you are not allowed to be noisy from 11 pm till 7 am. Why they can just breach the contract so many times with no consequences and I have to suffer sleepless nights. And of course they didn't stop but I felt hopeless to reach out again to the staff members. Even outside people always partying, screaming in the parking, a guy blasting music from his car all night, but nobody does anything.\n\nAlso whenever the maintenance guy was coming he was leaving a mess behind. If it was a clogged shower I was finding water splashed everywhere. I reported the vacuum cleaner once and he left a pile of dust in the kitchen.\n\nOne day before my contract ending the staff members came to knock at my door to remind me my rent is ending. I found that rude. I know my rent is ending you don't have to come at my door to tell me. They sent email and phone messages reminders about that the days before anyways.",

Main pool + teaching pool (more olympic and standard) and fun pool + toddler pool. The fun pool offers a waterslide, wave-machine (🤯), small kidslide, etc.\nGym: decent gym with all that you would need from a gym at a more affordable price to competitors like JD. Unfortunately, during busy times you may have to wait fairly long for a machine or wieghts. Also, when equipment is damaged, it is usually fixed or replaced after a long time.\nSports hall: I have booked for badminton and it does the job.\nSquash: courts available but haven't tried it.\nClasses: recommended by a few to me.",

Main pool + teaching pool (more olympic and standard) and fun pool + toddler pool. The fun pool offers a waterslide, wave-machine (🤯), small kidslide, etc.\nGym: decent gym with all that you would need from a gym at a more affordable price to competitors like JD. Unfortunately, during busy times you may have to wait fairly long for a machine or wieghts. Also, when equipment is damaged, it is usually fixed or replaced after a long time.\nSports hall: I have booked for badminton and it does the job.\nSquash: courts available but haven't tried it.\nClasses: recommended by a few to me.",

The leisure pool is perfect for all ages, with warm, clean water and fun features that keep everyone entertained. It’s spacious but still feels safe and well-organized.\n\nA special mention goes to the lifeguards, who were incredibly professional, attentive, and friendly. It was making sure everyone was safe while still creating a welcoming and relaxed.\n\nIn the leisure pool they have waves and slide for everyone to enjoy.\n\nThe teaching pool at Woodford Leisure Centre is absolutely fantastic! It’s warm, clean, and perfectly designed for beginners for young children and adults. The shallow depth makes it feel very safe and welcoming, which is great for building water confidence. The instructors are friendly, patient, and really know how to make learning fun. I couldn’t recommend it more highly for anyone looking for a great place to start swimming!",

There's not enough slope.\nThe soap grime on the shower walls (in female) has not been cleaned once in my time here.\nStaff change over is ridiculous as the company doesn't care enough for their staff. 0hour contracts is unacceptable! Jess is fantastic and really encouraging. Charlie was great but he left. Francis was great also another that left.\nThe gym only has instructors available to help if they're doing a hit class. There's never staff around.\nThe pool area is usually clean. I don't fancy my chances with the life guards that sit eating or picking their nails. The jacuzzi gets randomly closed off and reopened throughout the day. (I've watched the sign being moved). The swim lanes often have old gents walking in them having a good chat.

Steph was so lovely at showing me around and answering all my questions. She made me feel excited about joining as she has such passion for the club. I went for a look around to potentially join myself, however I was completely blown away of how much it has a family feel to it and therefore joined my 5 year old too. I had lots of questions about the kids club, as my son is non verbal and autistic and Steph got Jack to come over to put my mind at ease. I am blown away by how inclusive you are and how trained your staff are, you should be so proud. Jack was really supportive and understanding and offered a slow transition for my son. My son loves the pool and his 1-1 swimming lessons. He smiles every time we enter the club, it has made him so happy and created a new routine for us. I have been a member for over two months now and it’s a wonderful place to be, not only to exercise but also to relax. It’s like a mini haven. I couldn’t recommend joining enough ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

It is now completely overcrowded with teenagers using it like it’s a nightclub and training in packs. No policing from gym staff despite me flagging again and again. It is so dirty now and bins overflowing with dirty tissues and rubbish on the floor. Thick dust and dirty windows, peeling paint all along the rafters. I don’t think the ladies sauna floor has ever been cleaned ever. I’ve not been in the pool for years as people come out and say it’s like a holiday pool with so many teenagers shouting and messing around you can’t swim. They mess about rather than train and because no one calls out the ones who don’t put their gym equipment away or are messing about on the gym floor, they continue to disrespect the gym. If the staff has standards and enforced rules there might be more respect. My son also tells me the men use the sauna naked with no towel and nothing is done. Massive hygiene issues and no one cares. I do wonder why developers can’t see a niche market to build a new one-people would move en masse.",

We absolutely love every lesson with Lucy! She always finds energy to deal with kids with a smile, makes lessons fun, interactive, inclusive. I was amazed witnessing her, there was one day when she was In the middle of explaining the next exercise to the kids and one of the students was messing about and put arm bands on his feet. She stopped almost mid sentence and immediately turned over to the kid and explained why it is unsafe to do that. Because it was a safety thing. I was amazed!

The music pumping out daily is on loop and is generic dance instrumental, audio torture in my own opinion (Headphones are a must). A change would be good! A nice assortment of resistance machines and a good selection of budget quality free weights, benches, barbells, Olympic squat racks, but seemingly only one bench press quietly placed in the corner, for a movement such as this how they rationalise this is a mystery, The cardio machines are mid 00s quality, old but do the job however you are facing a giant mirror, not a wall with motivational pictures on which I personally would prefer. Bizarrely 60% of the lockers have broken locks deeming them unusable, so where does one secure there belongings. I feel for anyone attending when its busy as they only have 3 toilets / showers which are combined, so you'll have a wait. I have seen some very unclean floors here which can only be a cleaning staffing issue, but to be fair its hit and miss as other days i see cleaners in there making it clean. There is a separate area for bodyweight exercises / abs which is considerate however seems a little crowded, There are the usual overpriced snack machines selling processed so called (healthy snacks and drinks) there are no hand towels, no disinfectant for machines and benches, however they do supply free drinking water which is pleasant and a must to be fair even at this price point. I have not met any staff but have seen one or two about the place, fire extinguishers and fire escapes are present if you look for them, not a fan of the keypad revolving door method of access, Overall on balance for less than £1 a day you get what you pay for and this should be considered when taking out a membership, speaking of memberships a real positive is being able to start a membership in minutes via the app or website, and same for cancellations, simply cancel your DD 4 days before the next one is due and that's it, cancelled, no contracts, no paperwork, no face to face conversations persuading you to stay on, this for me is a huge plus as I tend to go to a gym sporadically throughout the year so the ability to come and go is great. Beverley is a better place for this establishment as obviously exercise has far reaching benefits that this place enables, there is a Morrison's a few yards away for pre and post workout fuel, or getting tea, a petrol station a few yards away which is convenient and a not so convenient Mcdonalds opposite the gym, Car parking could be an issue on busy weekends, but not for me when i attend bright and early there's ample space, parking is free but may have time restrictions.",

Considering there was over 40 people in with no staff that's a lot of dirty sweat.\n\nThere is a reasonable amount of lockers but none of them work, nearly all the cam locks are broken therefore unfunctionable.\n\nIt Is fantastic that it is opened 24 hours unfortunately they are neglecting the things that really matter which is clearly a financial decision.\n\nSomewhat disappointing really",

I was disappointed there was no coffee. The Tesco express has a Costa Coffee machine though. Coffee is advertised in reception but I think I was up too early as there was no one in reception.\nWill definitely stay here again.",

A bus service just nearby takes you to the nearest town and seaside, a local beach is about 10 minutes walk away, we actually saw a seal that came up onto the beach where we were standing. Nice site and highly recommended by me.",

Very reasonable pricing on all drinks. This is open Friday/Saturday! Sunday evenings from around 4pm\n\nA large screen TV usually shows one sport or another and a game of bingo on Saturday evening.

We checked in at 4 we did arrived a little earlier and had a drink in the bar but no dogs aloud inside so had to sit out in the cold.   When we went in the caravan was so dirty, we had mould growing up the walls,  radiators full of dirt and hairs.  Under the cooker hasn’t been looked at for months had hairs food and even dog teats under there.   The carpet had stains and the sofa had stains. The bathroom was full of mould around the shower and smelt of wee. The water was white no matter how long it was run for they just said it was an issue with Yorkshire water , we had no bottled water and no offer of any water either.    It was the worst caravan I had ever stayed in and I’ve stayed in bronze and never had a problem.   My husband went to reception Tuesday and complained as we didn’t have a frying pan either so they sent one eventually and the lady who brought it came in with bleach spray and cleaned it was uncomfortable and didn’t work.   On Thursday I asked to speak to the manager who basically told me a gold plus just means we have heating and double glazing!! I said after my cleanliness problems I looked at the reviews which I should have before I went maybe and she said take them with a pinch of salt people like to moan! Well my review is honest.   I have never stayed somewhere so dirty.\nEven the swimming pool was shut most of our break could only use is once.",

          "reviewText": "I booked a family break for the October half term.   I booked a gold plus dog friendly caravan as we had 2 dogs with us.  We checked in at 4 we did arrived a little earlier and had a drink in the bar but no dogs aloud inside so had to sit out in the cold.   When we went in the caravan was so dirty, we had mould growing up the walls,  radiators full of dirt and hairs.  Under the cooker hasn’t been looked at for months had hairs food and even dog teats under there.   The carpet had stains and the sofa had stains. The bathroom was full of mould around the shower and smelt of wee. The water was white no matter how long it was run for they just said it was an issue with Yorkshire water , we had no bottled water and no offer of any water either.    It was the worst caravan I had ever stayed in and I’ve stayed in bronze and never had a problem.   My husband went to reception Tuesday and complained as we didn’t have a frying pan either so they sent one eventually and the lady who brought it came in with bleach spray and cleaned it was uncomfortable and didn’t work.   On Thursday I asked to speak to the manager who basically told me a gold plus just means we have heating and double glazing!! I said after my cleanliness problems I looked at the reviews which I should have before I went maybe and she said take them with a pinch of salt people like to moan! Well my review is honest.   I have never stayed somewhere so dirty.\nEven the swimming pool was shut most of our break could only use is once.",

Excellent location, within walking distance of the wonderful Beverley Minster, and Beverley town centre, Hull and the east coast resorts, are close by. The site is still being developed but the usable part is well maintained. The touring pitches are static bases, so large. When booking make sure your pitch has all the services, not all of them have. The pitches are a bit fiddly poisoning the caravan on the pitch,  if you have a motor mover its fine. Toilets and showers are clean and cleaned twice a day. The showers are the most expensive I've come across  at £2.50    tokens only, purchased  at reception, the electric is included so maybe that balances it out. Overall, a quiet site good location and friendly helpful staff.",

Toilet and shower facilities spotless so all was looking good for a nice stay.\nPitch was near road that didn't look very busy and coming from a big city we are used to road noise.\nAt approx 8 to 9 pm the road becomes a race track with boy races with very loud exhausts flying past next to caravan at crazy speeds to the early hours. Then at 6.30 the morning traffic starts.\nThe site was quiet and apart from several seasonal pitches that were not being used. We on saw 3 other couple using the site.\nWhy when site was so quiet the owners didn't put us on the pitches away from the road I don't know. This would have been quieter for us and encouraged us to come back to what could be a very nice site. The owners cannot be responsible for the road noise or the boy racers but the are responsible for placing you on a pitch next to the road when others are available. We had set the caravan up by the time we found out about the noise so didn't want the hassle of moving again.We will not be returning to this site unfortunately.",
