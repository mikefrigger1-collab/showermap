          "reviewText": "I've been attending the gym at Hough End for almost a year now so my review is mostly about the gym. I would start by saying the staff and PTs are lovely, but a lot of fault relates to the cost of a membership vs the facilities. I am lucky I'm on a student membership but wouldn't justify the full price when this ends, but this is still double my previous gym membership elsewhere. As far as I know, you can't have a gym membership by itself without the full facilities so if you're just looking for a gym I don't think the monthly cost justifies this one.\n\nPros: lovely staff, a lot of racks and a very fair range of equipment, kept clean mostly (sometimes I have black on my hands after using any pull up bars and some weights but find this is normal for busy gyms). Aside from groups of some young kids everyone is super respectful and keeps to themselves in the gym, surprisingly you don't get that everywhere.\n\nCons: A lot of equipment is old and broken (damaged weights), always weights everywhere at the time I attend\n\nCable machines also need some TLC, most of them are rusty, worn .etc\n\nPretty much all of the benches are wonky. If you're looking for the 1.25kg plates they're all under the benches to keep them stable, again the wheels seem to be worn some worse then others\n\nFor some reason a lot of the racks are not straight/aligned to the wall which is super awkward\n\nSome of the rack parts are also worn down, so when the bar is re-racked it's uneven and awkward when finishing a heavy set, some of them so bad you go a bit mad thinking you've put one side on the wrong wrung but it's just so worn down that the bar is tilted\n\nThe water fountain always seems to be broken and can't fill up water bottle fully\n\nWhile I appreciate it's a community gym, most days at around 3pm the lady's locker room stinks of weed (not sure how the front desk don't notice this) and sometimes there are groups of kids in the gym (with a teacher maybe?) who are extremely disruptive, which is a bit annoying for paid members, of course they have a right to be there as well but would be nice if they were properly supervised\n\nNot fault of the gym but the app absolutely sucks. I miss fob access to gyms! I thought at least the app would be useful for timetables e.g. swimming but after a year I still don't understand when I can go swimming, this not making full use of the membership.\n\nIt feels like although the cost has recently increased there is not enough investment in the gym equipment and gym facilities.",

          "reviewText": "Serious safeguarding and dignity breach affecting a disabled woman at Hough End Leisure Centre (Better/GLL – Manchester City Council contract):A disabled woman who uses a wheelchair experienced a serious breach of privacy and dignity at Hough End Leisure Centre, which is operated by Better (GLL) under contract with Manchester City Council.\nOn 10 July 2025, she was using the locked, RADAR key disabled changing room when a male member of staff, assisting another customer, opened the door and entered the room despite her loudly and repeatedly stating that the room was occupied and that she was a disabled woman getting changed. She was partially undressed at the time. After this intrusion, the door was left unsecured, which she only discovered after dressing and leaving the room, while already in considerable distress.\nThe incident left her feeling humiliated, unsafe and unable to trust the facility. She cancelled her membership immediately. She then pursued a formal complaint with both Better/GLL and Manchester City Council.\nIn writing, the Council has accepted that her privacy and dignity were not protected and that both GLL and Manchester City Council share responsibility for the incident. Nevertheless, the practical outcome was extremely limited:\n•\tBetter/GLL have relied heavily on vague references to “learning” and “training” without clear, dated, verifiable safeguards.\n•\tManchester City Council has described the incident as a “judgement call” by staff and has denied any wider “systemic failure”, despite the combination of a lock override, lack of an “occupied” indicator, entry after shouted objections, and failure to secure the door afterwards.\n•\tThe tangible remedy offered to the woman has been a refund and three months’ free membership, which she understandably declined.\nThe Local Government & Social Care Ombudsman later decided not to investigate further on the basis that the Council had apologised and offered what it viewed as a “proportionate” remedy. That does not mean the incident was minor or acceptable; it simply means that, procedurally, the Ombudsman was satisfied that the Council had done the minimum required within its own framework.\nFrom an objective, safeguarding perspective this case is deeply troubling:\n•\tA locked accessible changing room, used by a disabled woman in a state of undress, was accessed from outside despite clear warnings.\n•\tThe door was then left unsecured, compounding the violation.\n•\tThe systems and culture in place allowed this to happen, and subsequent responses have minimised any suggestion of systemic failure.\nThis incident is particularly alarming for women with disabilities, who are at heightened risk of harm and rely on accessible facilities being genuinely private and secure. The combination of:\n•\tmale staff override access,\n•\tabsence of reliable “occupied” indicators, and\n•\tminimisation of the incident as a one off “mistake”\nshould concern any woman, and especially any disabled woman, considering using these facilities.\nIn short:\n•\tThe facts are documented and not seriously disputed.\n•\tThe woman’s dignity and privacy were violated in a way that any reasonable person would find degrading.\n•\tThe remedial response has been, at best, minimal and defensive, focused on process compliance rather than robust protection for disabled women.\nProspective users – particularly disabled women – should be aware of this history when deciding whether they feel safe using Hough End Leisure Centre or other Better/GLL operated, council commissioned facilities in Manchester.",

We went during the holidays for family fun day and it was really nice loads of other families there having fun with theor children to. Lots of smiles all around. They provide small floats watering can buckets and water noodles for the children to use whilst there. The time flew by though as it was only 50 mins and the only down side that I didn't like was that when we came out the aisle where we had changed and put our clothes in the locker was then closed off for school use only. So it was a struggle to get our clothes out of the locker and as I sent my boys into the changing room a teacher from the school had told me that we was able to use the changing room now as it was  for the school children. But we ended up using it anyway because there was no way we was going to go looking for another changing room wet and cold. I think this should be something you all should work on. Other than that my boys had a blast and was absolutely tired when they came out.",

The pool is great, and there’s also a café and a bookshelf inside, which makes it a nice spot to spend time, especially on a rainy day. Lockers need a £1 coin. Overall, very convenient and welcoming.",

When I arrived to the pool, there were nowhere to swim in the area ‘swim for all’, because there was some kids session, 2/3 of the pool was busy for kids. I asked staff where I can swim, with swim for all ticket, they said I can use 2 last lines. I tried to swim for 5 min, with 5 other people, and I just didn’t feel comfortable to do it. After I went back and complained about the situation. They let me go to fitness area, after 25 min, I was kicked out of fitness area because some other session started. So I went back and tried to go to swim for all area, as it was less busy. I was stopped by the member of staff as they said some other session will start now, and I can only swim with kids and parents. This is a joke, it is impossible to swim around 20 people in the small pool area and kids. So I paid for 30 min or so of swimming, £6.5. I went there to relax and have a good time, but in the end felt stressed and upset. Seems not fair. Also there are only 3 private shower cabins, so I had to wait a long time to go there. I am not sure how it is possible to pack all of these people in this area and still get money from them. Very disappointed.",

The main pool changing area is great for this, featuring several accessible toilets and a changing places facility, as well as a seated option for the showers by the pool, which I expected to be able to access on the day.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were told that there was a swimming competition on, so we'd be in the basement pool. Downstairs, we found that there were only gender segregated changing rooms, with no private accessible changing spaces in either. I ended up getting changed in the disabled toilet, but my partner had to use the male changing room which meant I was unable to call for him when I needed assistance. There was no bench/stool to sit on while changing in the accessible toilet and therefore I was unable to fully change independently. After my swim, I went to the \"accessible\" shower to find there was no seat at all. I was unable to use it, and I feel for anyone with less mobility attending the pool - were I to bring my wheelchair, would I be expected to take it with me into the shower?\n\nI left feeling very disheartened, and since I wasn't informed when booking that I wouldn't be in the main pool, I find myself afraid to book another session in case I find the same issue.",

The gym equipment is dirty and sometimes even sticky, the gaps on machines are full of crumbs, hair and God knows what else to the point it has created a layer of gunk. It’s really demotivating to even get on them. Same with the Dance studio. I went to a yoga class but was put off by the horrendous smell of feet. The whole floor was dirty with dust and crumbs and even some dried up spillage. Considering it was a yoga class where majority of movement you do is on a floor/mat its really unacceptable. After the class I had to brush off my leggings because they were left with dust and dirt all over them.\nAnd then the pool!!!! To a naked eye it looks clean however the other day I brought in some swimming goggles with me and to be honest I wish I could un-see what was going on under water- hair clump clusters in more than one place, unspecified white blobs floating around and the thing that tipped it all over the edge was a cotton q-tip on the bottom of the pool. How does that even get in there. I have no idea if they clean the pool but if they do it’s not very often at all.\nAnd lastly the toilets are really bad- there has not been one visit where the toilets have been in a good condition. I should not be cleaning after someone else just to use the toilet. Really disgusting.\nVery very unsanitary!!! Bad cleaning issue!",

I reported her to the reception and left, I was still charged for the following month. I really think they should pay more attention to customers and who they hire.",

Firstly, we book women swimming lessons and on entering there is a mixed pool session going on which completely defeats the purpose of women only swimming lessons. I then ask for a refund and a membership cancellation but I have gone back and forth with customer services multiple times and I STILL get an email telling me that the next payment is going through. There has not one update on the refund I had submitted which has now been over one month ago. I’m absolutely appalled and sick of this.  Will not be using this leisure centre again.",

When trying to get dressed teenage boys banging on the changing room walls and doors felt very unsafe at this swimming pool and would not recommend or go again.

The bespoke reception area and Lego model of the building. We love the history wall which details the building’s interesting lore and fortuitous restoration. Highly appreciate the colours, especially in the sauna, which, at the risk of sounding like this South Manchester-based pool’s target demographic, give Wes Anderson. Put your head in the water whilst swimming and things can get a bit serene and it is quite delightful, provided you don’t read the section on water quality. 9/10\n\nPool Dimensions: More or less your common-or-garden size, not particularly massive and not too tight. I’d appreciate a bit more depth, but sometimes you can expect too much and it is good to be happy with what you have got. Imran from a few Google Reviews south of us claims that his child drowned in this pool, and far be it from me to question his expertise in this area but the only way I see this being the case is if his child is/was three inches tall. 5/10\n\nAmenities and Facilities: Standard issue gym. Perhaps the best sauna in the business, with an ambitious size and fun little rocking chairs to wait your turn in, although the sauna showers are basically a single stream of water. The clientele and staff cultivate a very collegiate and genial vibe, if not particularly warm. Prudes may turn their noses up at the changing facilities, given that they are located around the edges of the pool and are relatively low cut, but I find this lends a bit of a frisson to the changing experience and adds to the gentleman’s club atmosphere.  8/10\n\nWater Quality: Life is made up of compromises. It is perhaps to be expected that, when receiving high quality amenities and aesthetics in such a venerable location, there are certain sacrifices you have to accept. Here, the sacrifice is bitty. Sadly, the rumours of bitty are not greatly exaggerated. For those of you who are not pool cognoscenti, bitty refers to the flotsam and jetsam that can accumulate in pools if they are not adequately maintained — hair, skin flakes, matter, etc. The quaint beauty of this pool’s water is marred by bitty. Bitties lay strewn across the length and breadth of the pool, they float in its midsection, they cling to your arms and legs. Bitty here, bitty there, bitty everywhere, it is truly Bitty City. Swimming here with goggles can feel like one is playing Crossy Road, only with the player character replaced by one’s lithe swimmers body and the cars and trains and whatnot by tangles of pubic hair and specks of black matter. Things can go from Wes Anderson to Paul WS Anderson in a remarkably short amount of time, especially if you are somewhat prone to accidentally ingesting water when you swim, like yours truly. Eating and drinking bitty should never be something you accept as part of a gorgeous swim. 5/10",

Things can go from Wes Anderson to Paul WS Anderson in a remarkably short amount of time, especially if you are somewhat prone to accidentally ingesting water when you swim, like yours truly. Eating and drinking bitty should never be something you accept as part of a gorgeous swim. 5/10",

An all-round positive experience except for one aspect:\n\nIn the changing room, my locker took my pound but then wouldn't lock so I had to leave it unlocked while I was in the pool. I raised it with a member of staff afterwards who had a look at it with me and told me it was all working fine and there definitely wasn't a pound stuck inside (even though when I was trying to use it, it was behaving as if there was a pound inside). They offered me a free locker token (which means nothing) but said they couldn't do anything else. He said he'd lose his job if he gave me a pound from the till. A woman who heard what was going on then offered me a pound because she said she \"didn't need it\", so I guess it's plausible, without wanting to cast undue aspersions, that the woman saw me struggle and somehow managed to get the pound out and keep it for herself while I was getting the member of staff, then felt a bit guilty about it. In any event, it would be nice to feel trusted and be able to trust that the staff are willing to do the right thing rather than hide behind a fear of losing their employment.",

The strength training sections especially are often dominated by men in a way that can feel somewhat intimidating to insert oneself into.\n\nFor instance, large groups taking over equipment without necessarily using it, people watching videos without headphones, and weights and equipment being left scattered across walkways or across mats and benches. The gym can absolutely be a social space, but there just isn’t the space for a group of several blokes to hog equipment while socialising without it feeling unwelcoming - especially as the weights section is very cramped, so any ways of making this area feel more inviting and encouraging good etiquette on using space would be much appreciated",

The staff are always friendly and greet you with a smile when you walk in. The location is ideal if you’re coming in from Piccadilly Station – just a short walk away.\n\nWhile the gym itself is on the smaller side, it’s very well-equipped with everything you need: 3 squat racks, smith machines, multiple cable machines, plenty of free weights, and more. There are also fantastic bonus amenities you don’t find in many gyms – Theraguns, vibrating foam rollers, free body composition scans with printed results, Dyson hair dryers and straighteners, and even deodorant by changing rooms.\n\nThe place is always spotless, and the members here tend to be a bit more mature and respectful, which makes for a great training environment. Even during peak hours, it never feels overcrowded, and I can always get a full workout in without waiting around for equipment.\n\nOverall, a top-quality gym with a welcoming atmosphere – highly recommended!",

The place is filthy, easily one of the dirtiest gyms I’ve ever used. I’ve seen everything from half eaten chicken pies and beer cans left in the showers to bloody socks, food wrappers, and general litter scattered around. The mirrors are streaked and stained, equipment is left everywhere, and in the months I’ve been a member I haven’t once seen a cleaner or staff member giving the place proper attention.\n\nEquipment:\nThe machines and weights themselves are fine for the price (£17/month), and you can get a decent workout in if you’re patient. The real problem is organisation, nothing is put back in place, so half the session is wasted searching for dumbbells or cleaning things before use.\n\nChanging Rooms & Facilities:\nThe changing rooms are genuinely disgusting. Toilets stink, showers are broken (most give barely a trickle, the few that work are scalding hot) and smell like urine. The new lockers already have broken locks and bent doors. Todays new addition was the huge hole in the men’s changing room wall. The hairdryers are so weak you’d be quicker letting your hair dry naturally, literally 2-3 business days to dry anything!\n\nOverall:\nIt’s such a shame because the gym’s location and basic set-up could make it a brilliant space. Instead, it’s completely neglected and poorly managed. Unless cleanliness and maintenance improve dramatically, I can’t recommend it unless you're in and out to change at work/home.",

The mirrors are streaked and stained, equipment is left everywhere, and in the months I’ve been a member I haven’t once seen a cleaner or staff member giving the place proper attention.\n\nEquipment:\nThe machines and weights themselves are fine for the price (£17/month), and you can get a decent workout in if you’re patient. The real problem is organisation, nothing is put back in place, so half the session is wasted searching for dumbbells or cleaning things before use.\n\nChanging Rooms & Facilities:\nThe changing rooms are genuinely disgusting. Toilets stink, showers are broken (most give barely a trickle, the few that work are scalding hot) and smell like urine. The new lockers already have broken locks and bent doors. Todays new addition was the huge hole in the men’s changing room wall. The hairdryers are so weak you’d be quicker letting your hair dry naturally, literally 2-3 business days to dry anything!\n\nOverall:\nIt’s such a shame because the gym’s location and basic set-up could make it a brilliant space. Instead, it’s completely neglected and poorly managed. Unless cleanliness and maintenance improve dramatically, I can’t recommend it unless you're in and out to change at work/home.",

The gym is very well lit, and for my first time there it was very easy to find the locker room and toilet facilities, as there are signs placed near the entrance to guide you. The male locker room itself is spatious, clean and well looked after. The lockers are in great condition and easy to use, they even have 2 private changing spaces, never seen this before and a really great addition!\n\nThe equipment is in good shape as well, barely found anything other than a couple of wrinkles on the benches. The dumbells are all in good shape as well. The free weights floor is organised and clean. The machines are all spaced well so I didn’t feel like I was in someone else’s space. The cleaning solution sprays and paper towels are full and readily available accross the gym floor. My workout was for chest and shoulders, so I didn’t try everything, but I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of equipment, which I find is sometimes lacking in other locations.\n\nThe atmosphere in the gym was very welcoming, the music was great too (just the right level, as I tend to get migraines in gyms with loud music). For a saturday morning it was really great; it’s a shame I’m a bit far to make this location my home gym!",

The water coming from it was cold as well even though I tried for  hot water in every setting possible, which made the experience unpleasant and unsuitable for users who need accessible facilities. It’s disappointing that this branch does not maintain the same standards for accessible facilities as other The Gym Group locations.

Anytime that’s not off peak it is too busy to have a structured workout. The kit is always in good shape and it’s cheap but by far the worst thing about this gym is the smell. It stinks from the moment you go in, ventilation is awful and always smells of paint. The men’s changing rooms smell so strong with urine I couldn’t even use them. The car park is not big enough for amount of members either. Signed up multiple times throughout the year and these problems never got fixed. Sorry pure gym, just not a motivating please to workout. Felt like I was forcing myself to go here.",

Of course, they've got waste bins to put all rubbish in.\n\nThe pitch is really comfortable to play a 5-7 aside.

A huge shoutout must go to the cleaning team—the gym and changing rooms are always immaculately clean.\n\nFacilities and Layout\n\nThe facilities here are brilliant and cater to all my needs. The swimming pool, sauna, and steam room—they are perfect for winding down after a hard session. The changing room facilities and showers are also very good and well-maintained.\n\nThe gym layout itself is fantastic, offering diverse training areas.

My personal favourites are the high-energy Met Con and Circuits sessions and the calming Body Balance class.\n\nPersonal Trainer Recommendation: Dan Nottingham\n\nFinally, if you are looking for a personal trainer, I cannot recommend Dan Nottingham highly enough. I’ve been training with Dan for three years now, and he is absolutely superb. He's knowledgeable, motivating, and his guidance has been a core part of my fitness journey. The gym staff and all the personal trainers, in general, are great, but Dan is truly exceptional.\n\nIn summary, Nuffield Health Manchester is a clean, well-equipped, and friendly gym.💚💚💪",

He’s always cheerful, helpful, and keeps everything immaculate. The sauna, steam room, and swimming facilities are also really good and clearly well maintained — you can see regular checks being done, which is great to see.\n\nNow, onto the rest. The actual gym staff\naren’t helpful at all - same goes for the reception team. They just don’t seem interested and the customer service is really poor. It gives off the impression that they couldn’t care less about members, which is disappointing considering the price point of this gym.\n\nThe gym itself feels dated, with worn-out equipment that’s long overdue an upgrade. There’s much better kit and value for money at other gyms in Manchester that cost far less. The layout is also frustrating - it makes no sense at all. For example, there’s a dumbbell rack placed directly behind a barbell thrust machine, so when someone’s using it, you can’t even access the weights rack. It’s just poor design and really inconvenient.\n\nOverall, the cleaning and spa facilities are a credit to the place, but the actual gym area and staff experience seriously let it down. It feels like it’s running on reputation rather than quality - definitely not worth the premium membership cost.",

They all seem very knowledgeable, approachable, and are excellent trainers/coaches.  There is a new manager in place who runs a tight ship and is keen to take the gym to the next level.

          "reviewText": "Manchester Oxford Rd gym is perfect for NHS workers as it is located by MRI. Nice layout and good selection of equipment. Clean gym (I go before 7 am) However, the squat racks aren't against a wall so they don't have a mirror so, I can't check my form. The other large mirror near where the kettlebells are is not long enough so, another downside when you doing exercises and need to check your form for ex knees, neck, back position. So that is a big downside for me. I have been to other gyms in the past and never had this issue. Also, in the showers I can't place my shower gel, shampoo etc anywhere. I don't like to place my items on the floor. They should provide a little shelve in each shower. Overall the gym is great and off peak membership suits me. Thank you",

There are not enough weight plates for the large number of members, and there are no sprays or paper towels available to clean the benches before use.\nIn the night shift, there was no hand soap in the toilets, and water was collected on the floor of the bathroom — which made it quite unhygienic.\nI’ve used The Gym Group in another location before, and it was much better — the equipment was newer, everything was clean, and the hygiene standards were properly maintained.

The equipment is top-tier and everything is well-maintained, high-quality, and exactly what you’d want in a serious training environment. What really sets it apart is the atmosphere - members and owners all respect the space, put the weights back, and if anything is ever out of place, it gets sorted quickly. There’s a real sense of accountability here, which is rare in most gyms.\n\nThere’s always something happening - mobility workshops, squat technique sessions, and even rooftop yoga, which just adds to the experience. The resident coaches, like Adam, are incredibly knowledgeable and always happy to help.\n\nWhen I first started training here, I felt like I didn’t belong. I wasn’t as strong as the powerlifters, bodybuilders, or weightlifters around me, and it was intimidating at first. But the truth is, you’d rather be a small fish in a pond with big fish than the biggest fish in a small pond. Being surrounded by people who were stronger and more experienced pushed me to level up. Over the past year, I’ve built so much muscle and seen massive improvements - not just physically, but in my confidence and mindset too.\n\nI’ve trained at various commercial gyms before, and the difference is night and day. At Federation, you’re not just paying for access to machines but you’re investing in an environment that actually supports your progress. The monthly membership is around £60, and a day pass is £10-£15, but honestly, it’s worth every penny. Health is wealth, and if someone can’t justify the price, there’s always PureGym… where you can experience the true pain of dodging dumbbells left on the floor and fighting for a working machine.\n\nBeyond the training space, they have on-site physio, which is a game-changer for recovery and injury prevention. They also have a posing room fully equipped with mirrors, so if you're into bodybuilding or prepping for a competition, there’s actually a dedicated space to refine your posing. Plenty of lockers too, so you don’t have to worry about storage.\n\nAnd if you ever need a quick snack or post-workout fuel, they’ve got you covered. They sell different types of protein bars ( Barbells Marshmallow is my new fav) and have meal prep available, so whatever you might need, it’s there. They also stock BCAA drinks, pre-workout and other supplements, making it super convenient if you ever forget something at home or need an extra boost before training.\n\nOh, and one more thing - if you’re lucky, you might get to meet Archer, the cutest gym dog. Just another reason why this place feels like home.\n\nThe only small downside? There aren’t separate changing rooms. But honestly, it’s a minor thing compared to everything else this place offers.\n\nMore than just a gym, Federation has been my therapy. It has saved me and changed my life forever. It’s the kind of place that pushes you to be better, not just physically but in every aspect of life. If you want a gym where you feel welcome, supported, and surrounded by people who actually care about their training (and the space they train in), Federation Gym is the place to be. Couldn’t recommend it moooooore.",

If you want a gym where you feel welcome, supported, and surrounded by people who actually care about their training (and the space they train in), Federation Gym is the place to be. Couldn’t recommend it moooooore.",

First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

He asked if I was married, had a boyfriend... looked me up and down slowly, and gestured at me in a thoroughly creepy way... how I could possibly be single, when I look like this?

          "reviewText": "Wow! Onroute Truckstops have been very busy at Swindon! What an amazing difference! My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.  Signage to parking was clear and concise, and there was ample space available.  Traffic flow was moderate and free.\n\nFirst engagement was the canteen, by which entry was via a newly developed entrance.  Stunning.  New groundwork’s was colourful and very pleasing to the eye.  There were new picnic tables positioned outside - and were being used.  New plants were positioned, giving the homely welcome.  A huge effort has been made to greet customers to this area and the transformation from the old side entrance is worlds apart.  There are new big screens displaying menus, new information points, leaflets, all safety measures present, serviceable, in date and correctly placed where applicable.\n\nI met ‘Claire’ behind the counter, who was welcoming, bright and bubbly and just what you need to lift your spirits from the drama and stress of the highways. Also in attendance were approximately 4 other staff and the whole food counter experience was top class.  A very nice touch was a bowl of free healthy fruit for visitors. Well done there.  Food service was very quick - top marks.\n\nThe canteen was spotless. There were plenty of customers throughout the day (I was there for a 24hr stop) and I watched with interest the positive energy this team had going on. Everyone was greeted with a welcome and a smile.  No name badges though, I’d like to have seen that - it’s a more personal presentation to thank someone and show appreciation by referring to them by name. It’s also awkward to have to ask, maybe this should be considered. On the opposite side of the coin it equally encourages staff to deliver excellence as it’s much easier to identify individual failings. Certainly not the case here today however.\n\nNo sooner had a diner finished a staff member was instantly on hand to clean and disinfect and prepare the space for the next customer.  There was also excellent promotion and encouragement by the staff to download and use the Onroute app.\n\nFeedback: drivers are still struggling to find the SNAP terminals to pay for parking and are constantly having to queue and ask at the counter, disrupting staff from the catering flow.  The terminals hidden away in the toilet corridor and are not signed. A staff member had put a handwritten sign on the access door to highlight the location but was told by management to take it down. This was a poor decision and negatively impacted good staff initiative.  It may not have been ideal or as professional as a custom branded sign, but it was better than nothing!  There is still no clear signage to the SNAP payment terminals and needs addressed for full score achievement.\n\nThe shop was well stocked and inviting. It’s bright and has most of the essentials needed for drivers. As soon as I approached the shop a member of staff was there to assist if needed. I made several purchases and the whole experience again was very good.\n\nThe toilet corridor from the canteen leads to access snap terminals, ladies, gents and disabled toilets, and showers.  It was clean, fresh, clear of debris; and both snap terminals were fully functional. All fire safety measures were present, in date and clearly identified.  Health & Safety measures were also in place and being used effectively.\n\nUnfortunately I can’t give any further details as I’ve run out of characters! Happy to be contacted if necessary. Staff deserve special credit for a near perfect experience. Well done. Very well done.",

The location is definitely the highlight, right in the centre of everything, close to shops, restaurants, and attractions. It’s also easy to reach using the free city bus, which stops nearby and makes getting around super convenient.\n\nThe hotel looks modern and has a lively, stylish atmosphere. My room was compact but well designed, with lots of power outlets, a smart TV, and a great shower with strong water pressure. It had everything I needed for a short stay.\n\nThat said, there were a few downsides. The bed was very hard, and the pipes were quite noisy, especially at night. The windows can’t be opened, so there’s no fresh air, which made the room feel a bit stuffy. Housekeeping isn’t daily, so you don’t automatically get clean towels each day, and the rooms are small, though that’s manageable for a short trip.\n\nOverall, YOTEL Deansgate is a decent option for a quick stay if you want a central location and modern facilities, but it lacks a bit of comfort for longer visits.",

There was dirty water everywhere (I'm not sure if it was urine or not, but it looked like urine) and there was no toilet paper. It was clear that this place had not been cleaned for a long time.  The walls of the showers were moldy and the drain in the bathroom was completely blocked, that you had to shower in a lake of grey water for 15 minutes! The shower water was either very hot or suddenly very cold and icy. The few hours we spent in this campsite were more like a nightmare. I recommend that you definitely check the place first before paying. Because the payment is made immediately upon arrival and you have no choice but to stay and bear it, especially if you arrive late. Because the lord lady will disappear after receiving the money.

There was also a man who kindly brought out a bowl of water for my dog as we waited outside reception to check in. Would definitely return to this site. The rules are the same as all campsites and we had a really peaceful night and left early the next day. Facilities were nice too - free showers and I saw they had a laundry room too. Thank you!",

Sited on the land of a family farm, it lies within the Hollingworth Lake Country Park which is, as the Rochdale Borough Council says, a great place to “soak in the stunning scenery; have a picnic; do water sports; discover wildlife in the nature reserve or just enjoy a relaxing walk around the picturesque lake.” All this just 6 country miles from the nearest junction on the M62, at exit 21.\n\nThe lake is a man-made reservoir for the Rochdale Canal and you can easily cycle or walk round it, less than 5 miles, partly on a level track (with a café on the way), partly on a narrow road and partly through the town of Littleborough. Walking paths and bridleways set off up the surrounding Pennine Hills. The sense of relaxation is the greater for seeing the motorway crossing a viaduct in the far distance, with a line of trucks waiting for the latest tailback to clear.\n\nThe campsite itself has an interesting history, with two brothers (the third generation to farm here) steadily developing it. Their sister runs the adjacent Dickey Steps Riding School for anyone wanting a lesson or a day ride. The original grass camping ground, ideal for tents and small campervans, has a basic toilet and washing up block, while a new area of spacious hardstanding pitches at the end of the access road gives a real sense of rural peace. The latest addition to the site is a splendid new reception and facilities building, with immaculate toilets and showers accessible to all campers. We were fascinated by the hill behind us, with its many horizontal striations (see photograph), presuming these were formed as the hill grew and the lake deepened.",

Can only assume they were from a while back before their new toilet and shower block was installed as we thought the site was great. Very quiet, large and flat pitches, respectful campers who kept the noise levels down. Couldn't ask for much more. Only reason we didn't give full 5 stars are a couple of minor things. Better signage would help be visitors know where everything is (especially pot washing) and the pot washing was limited and not under cover.

We had two pitches, both electric, one for a caravan and one for trailer tent.\n\nThe site is lovely and well kept, with new shower and toilet facilities that were clean and warm. The showers were only accessible up to 9:30pm (I like to have a shower before bed to warm up so this was a little early for me). There are toilets on the field for use at night.\n\nThe staff/owners were very informative and helpful at check in, they are very insistent on the noise level and the quiet time which put me a little on edge having 8 year old twins that don't know how to whisper and a nephew who had forgotten his hearing aids so spoke a little louder than normal but all was fine.\n\nThe electric pitches are only 6amp so be careful not to overload.\n\nOther families that were on site were lovely, on the last night a few different families got together with the children and had a football match on the centre field which everyone enjoyed.\n\nOverall a very nice site with close access to the lake and very affordable per night stay.",

We had two pitches, both electric, one for a caravan and one for trailer tent.\n\nThe site is lovely and well kept, with new shower and toilet facilities that were clean and warm. The showers were only accessible up to 9:30pm (I like to have a shower before bed to warm up so this was a little early for me). There are toilets on the field for use at night.\n\nThe staff/owners were very informative and helpful at check in, they are very insistent on the noise level and the quiet time which put me a little on edge having 8 year old twins that don't know how to whisper and a nephew who had forgotten his hearing aids so spoke a little louder than normal but all was fine.\n\nThe electric pitches are only 6amp so be careful not to overload.\n\nOther families that were on site were lovely, on the last night a few different families got together with the children and had a football match on the centre field which everyone enjoyed.\n\nOverall a very nice site with close access to the lake and very affordable per night stay.",

We'd booked two separate pitches at different times, but arrived together nice and early, and they managed to find two pitches adjacent to each other for us.\n\nAnd all this located in the heart of Dark/High Peak with numerous walks literally starting from the entrance gates. A good range of these walks are also on display, with route details available from staff on request.\n\nFinally, just a short stroll away is the first-class Sportsman Inn, also with very friendly and welcoming staff.  Nice range of beers, and a good menu.  The food was very nice, and they weren't stingy with the portion sizes.\n\nVery much looking forward to a return visit next season!",

A good size, although not sure how much room there would be around some of the biggest tents.\nDedicated campervan pitches too. Didn't look at the bell tents.\nFacilities were clean and functional, including a well received kettle, microwave and toaster. Hot shower! Pizzas on Friday night, but sadly we missed these.\nNearby walk to a waterfall which is pleasant, and can be extended (up to a mile) to a decent nearby pub. Didn't have time to explore anything further\nFriendly and helpful communication from Jessy running the site, including changing dates, although didn't manage to bump in to them IRL!\nIf I was staying in the area again would definitely go back",

We were lucky as it was Friday night pizza night which were delicious.\nThe site is really well run and Jessy and Ryan make everyone feel at home. We had a tent pitch which was ample for our 5 man tent which had a bark covering  which made it easy to put up a tent and not muddy. The standing for cars was gravel again a nice touch.\nAmenities were really clean and having an area to boil a kettle, microwave and wash up very welcome on a wet day. There were plenty of fire pits for everyone and the facility to have a fire pit in a large covered area again was welcome on a wet night.\nThe site is in a really good position to explore the countryside with lovely walk ( I will be back to try these out in better weather!) thanks Ryan and Jessy for making my grandsons introduction to camping such fun.",

The site has a great little  communal area complete with a fire pit. On a fri night, the site offers wood stove pizza, I will admit I really enjoyed the pizza it some of the best pizzas I have had, and I love pizza. They also have a nice and very clean communal sink area with shower and toilets. They also very kindly provide a fridge, toaster, and kettle for you to use, which I took advantage of as this was my first camping trip with my 2 kids. It made breakfast a lot easier when the kids demanded toast at the crack of dawn. But for me, the owner and their kids made it so welcoming. The kids played nicely as I set up, and the owners Jess and Ryan were great, offering advice on things to do and where to go, also going above and beyond when it all went wrong when one of my kids was poorly during the night. I can not recommend this place enough. 5 stars is not enough. I will be re visiting and have already passed their details on to some friends who want to try camping. Keep up the great work, and I will see you soon.",

Communication was seamless, I received WhatsApp updates throughout my journey, from details about the room number and PIN code to notifications that the room was ready and a reminder for check-out. The process was essentially self-service, though there is a reception available if needed. I found the whole system very streamlined and convenient.\n\nWe parked at Dale Street car park, which cost around £20 for 24 hours, and from there it was just a short walk to the hotel. The building itself is really impressive, it used to be a cotton factory, and they’ve done a great job blending the original industrial character with modern design.\n\nWe booked a studio apartment, which came with a bathroom and fully equipped kitchen. The bathroom had towels and toiletries (shampoo and shower gel), while the kitchen had all the day-to-day essentials, plus tea, coffee, and even a small bottle of milk in the fridge. There was also an iron, ironing board, and hairdryer in the room. The bed was very comfortable, big, and overall, the space felt well thought out and homely.\n\nOne small piece of feedback from my partner is that a larger mirror, or a mirror in better lighting, would have been useful for doing hair and makeup. As well, it would have been useful if there was some tissues, like kitchen roll etc.\n\nAll in all, the studio had everything we needed, the atmosphere was great, and I would happily recommend Native Manchester to anyone visiting the city.",

The problem is the times are quite restrictive. Opens at 7:30am which is just too late to get a swim in before work. It's only open in the evening past 6:30pm 3 times a week so there's basically 3 sessions a week anyone with normal working hours can make it. No swim on Saturday. I've also sometimes gone and there's no lane ropes out despite them usually being there and even though 5+ of us are trying to swim lengths. A few of us asked about the ropes as people were getting in our way just standing in the middle of the pool and we were told it's not a \"training pool\", whatever that is. Swimming lengths is a completely normal way to use a swimming pool and 4 lanes only take up half the pool, leaving enough room for everyone so I see no reason why they shouldn't always be out. I've never gone to the pool where there hasn't been people swimming lengths (or trying to) so removing the ropes makes no sense. There's a few regulars who think once they've got a lane it's theirs to keep and refuse to swim in circles to allow more than 2 people in a lane. The lifeguards refuse to get involved and say it's a \"public swim\" so they can't tell people how to swim.  So apparently people can treat it like their private pool. Seems like the lifeguards don't want to rock the boat with the regulars. Either that, or they're mates, or they just don't care. But a public pool means it needs to be shared by all and swimming circles is how it happens in any other pool I've ever been to in the world. No one can refuse to share a lane with someone. I've paid to enter but I can't swim, ridiculous.",

Staff are friendly and the place is clean.\n\nIt does get busy at peak times, and the changing rooms are basic, but overall it’s good value for money. Perfect if you just want to lift and train without any fancy extras.",

I emailed puregym 6-8 times on a space of three weeks - no reply as well as a member of staff - also no reply. I decided to send a letter in the post and contact them on resolver.\nIn the meantime I raised a dispute with my bank was credited back the £8.00 I was wrongly charged.\nI finally received a response from puregym which they have taken no accountability for poor customers service I have received.\nOvercharging me, ignoring my emails as well as staff. Restricting me access on the weekends when it states online when I’m allowed to go.\nInstead they just reiterated what I had put in the email to me. Sent me the times of when I can go to the gym when I already know. Due to the poor service I ask for first month to be foc ( due to errors they made and months free due to the inconvenience they caused) they ignored me stating “ sorry you feel we haven’t answered all of your questions”)\nIf they cannot treat their staff properly why would they treat their customers any different?? after all it’s their customers that keep them in business.\nAlso they are over subscribed, ( meaning they have too many customers and not enough equipment. There should be a limit on how many customers they take on. Should only take on more customers leave. To avoid customers harassing other customers whilst using the equipment cause too impatient to wait. ( I have had to alter my days I come to the gym - which I shouldn’t have to on various occasions)Also they have changing rooms aren’t always clean. Equipment seem to be out of use or broken which seem to take forever to fix - business has no problems in taken customers money/ ripping them off but extra slow on fixing equipment 🤨 stop making poor excuses regarding the pin not working due to technology- with all the money your business generates upgrade better software and programme AI to allow customers in instead of restricting them gaining access. Also head office read emails properly before responding to avoid stupidity on your part.\nOverall head office are useless when it comes to dealing with complaints. seem to hire amateurs know nothing about complaints would recommend this business at all.\nStaff seem to have restricted the shower facilities there like 6-8 showers but only tow are in use. Been like this almost two weeks now. Pretty bad cannot use all the facilities when you’re paying for a membership. Business should give customers reasonable amount refund on their memberships. Or close the shower off completely Renovate the showers the days it take refund the customers. After all customers are paying it’s not freebie. Amount money their making off customers.",

Equipment seem to be out of use or broken which seem to take forever to fix - business has no problems in taken customers money/ ripping them off but extra slow on fixing equipment 🤨 stop making poor excuses regarding the pin not working due to technology- with all the money your business generates upgrade better software and programme AI to allow customers in instead of restricting them gaining access. Also head office read emails properly before responding to avoid stupidity on your part.\nOverall head office are useless when it comes to dealing with complaints. seem to hire amateurs know nothing about complaints would recommend this business at all.\nStaff seem to have restricted the shower facilities there like 6-8 showers but only tow are in use. Been like this almost two weeks now. Pretty bad cannot use all the facilities when you’re paying for a membership. Business should give customers reasonable amount refund on their memberships. Or close the shower off completely Renovate the showers the days it take refund the customers. After all customers are paying it’s not freebie. Amount money their making off customers.",

The men's toilets are regularly in a disgusting state, with mould covering the ceilings and frequent leaks leaving puddles of urine on the floor. It's unhygienic and totally unacceptable for a national gym chain.\n\nThe showers are constantly “under repair”, but it seems more like tradesmen are just endlessly patching things up without fixing the actual issues. Feels like the gym’s being taken for a ride.\n\nWhat’s worse is the air conditioning – or lack of it. From day one, it's gone through spells of being awful. PureGym proudly claims to offer filtered, airy spaces, but that couldn’t be further from the truth here. It’s rubbish, plain and simple. The gym is dangerous. Staff routinely paint over mould spores rather than treat them properly. And when the air con fails, they stick fans out as a quick fix — which anyone with half a brain knows just circulates warm, stale, mould-ridden air.\n\nI’ve personally witnessed several members with health conditions having to leave the gym mid-session because the environment is so poor. Despite all this, PureGym has offered no refunds, no pause in membership, and no access to other local branches. It’s been two weeks since this latest spell of poor air quality began, and still, nothing has been resolved.\n\nThe manager seems to genuinely care, but it’s clear their hands are tied by head office. In my view, this gym should be temporarily closed on safety grounds until proper repairs and sanitation are carried out.\n\nWith new gyms opening in St Johns and Vauxhall, PureGym risks an exodus of members — and rightly so. Sort it out before someone gets seriously ill.",

Sauna and steam is in good state too.\nThe -1 star is that they don’t have day pass / swimming only memberships.\n\nThe reception team members and managers are all very friendly and making connections with locals and regular members, which is not commonly seen nowadays with gyms!\n\nNo reviews on the gym equipments as didn’t get in there.",

The place is so clean, full of equipments, nice pool and sauna, changing rooms, all the classes I've been to were so amazing and the PT all seem super nice! But oh, god, sometimes I regret my yearly subscription 😞 I like to follow a weight program and sometimes I get really frustrated. It can get very busy. You only have one equipment each kind and people like to sit and scroll on their phones for such a long period - last couple of weeks I finished my whole daily routine while waiting for one person in one equipment finish using it, and after a while I just had to give up doing it. I know this is more a people's behavior issue than the gym, but it lacks on the culture part or more equipments to keep the flow. I can see a lot of people training with the PTs. One of them really likes to chat while their customers is occupying the machine. All the others PT are sound!",

Considering it's not a cheap gym option there are major updates needed to the facilities and a lot of the equipment is regularly out of order.

The management seemed more interested in filling in the 2 jacuzzis and leaving one with cold water running - fairly pointless. My main concern is the cleanliness & working order of the sauna and steam room. Considering these are vital parts of the gym used regularly they are not kept clean at all and maintenance issues are not address. The same lockers in the changing rooms have remained broken and out of use for months. The ladies bathroom on the ground floor has broken skirting and the steam room has remained in the same condition for months with broken tiles and a cone!!! This is simply not good enough when considering the amount members pay. I was more inclined to discuss this over the phone with the management rather than post about this publicly yet the lady on reception was very rude and laughed at me when queried. Definitely not receiving the service we pay for and will probably leave for a cheaper / cleaner gym.",

This gym is quite compact, but the changing facilities are genuinely premium — far better than anything you’ll find in the other local gyms. Everything feels brand new, spotless and well maintained, which gives a great first impression.\n\nThere’s a good range of machines for its size, though nowhere near the amount or variety that Empowered offers. There are only a few lifting platforms and just one dedicated bench press, with a couple of Smith machines to make up for it. If your goal is powerlifting or heavy compound training, this probably isn’t the gym for you — they don’t have the thicker bars for deadlifting, and the overall setup is more suited to general fitness than strength work.\n\nThe staff are friendly, helpful and approachable, and the atmosphere is calm and comfortable. It feels more like a co-op gym, whereas places like PureGym and JD are more like big supermarkets — busier, louder, and less personal. Here everything’s a bit simpler, cleaner and more relaxed, which many people will appreciate.\n\nOne small issue I noticed is that the weight plates are very polished and a bit slippery, so be careful when moving them. It could also feel a little cramped if it gets busy, simply due to the layout.\n\nOverall, I’d describe it as a great gym for beginners or casual lifters — kind of a “lite version” of a hardcore gym. It’s modern, friendly, in a great location, and everything feels new and well looked after.",

Over the past sessions, I have noticed several issues that are affecting the children’s progress, confidence, and safety in the pool. Unfortunately, the current Stage 4 instructor does not pay enough attention to the individual needs of the children. When a child struggles with a movement or technique, he rarely notices or steps in to help them improve. This lack of attention makes it difficult for some children to feel supported, especially those who need extra guidance. Another concern is that the instructor spends a considerable amount of time talking instead of actively supervising and engaging with the children. During diving practice, there have been moments when a child could not hear his instructions, and instead of ensuring the child understood what to do, they were left on their own. This is particularly concerning because proper supervision is crucial for safety. A swimming instructor should always be attentive, responsive, and focused on every child in the class to help them learn and feel safe. Therefore, I respectfully request that management consider replacing the current Stage 4 instructor with someone who can provide better support, supervision, and guidance, ensuring all children progress effectively and safely during their lessons.”I request to maneger change teacher stage 4kids .",

There were tea and coffee facilities, but no milk provided, nor a fridge to put it in, had to get milk quickly from the cafe before it closed. No real structure to book in when arrived and the bed was not made on arrival either. TV only had 4 or 5 channels working. For £80 a night, I would be expecting no issues. If the price is to stay like that with no changes being made, I will not recommend this place. Very disappointed.",

Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have encountered these issues, and I believe it is crucial to address them for the health and safety of all patrons.\n\nThe state of the steam room was unacceptable, with visible dirt and grime, and the changing room and toilets were equally filthy. Such unsanitary conditions not only detract from the overall experience but also pose potential health risks to visitors. It is essential for facilities like these to maintain high hygiene standards to prevent the spread of illness.\n\nI urge management to take immediate action to improve the cleanliness of these areas, as it is vital for the well-being of all guests. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.",

My only issue was the shower situation in the change village. This seems to be the same in every swimming pool where you can take children. There is never enough of the private showers and there were some form of insects everywhere (I believe to be some kind of mite) but this is a small issue when the rest of the experience was so good. Staff were excellent also.",

Feel safe letting 3 children swim in the family pool as all children are at different stages of swimming. Also like the way swimmers go in every hour through the holidays and so pool never gets overcrowded.  Bit tight on parking spaces and not loads of changing rooms or showers and mirrors could do with replacing but overall a great pool for young families.",

The showers are fantastic I can’t deny that but all else is just a waste. The seating area as nice as it looks was totally empty as was the games area. The bar/restaurant could be made better with more smaller tables rather than the few large tables that only one person was sat at. Food was disappointing also. Overcooked. Breakfast I had pancakes that were solid and burnt, and was given a tiny tub of golden syrup. If you don’t know the difference between golden syrup and maple syrup (which was on the menu) you shouldn’t serve pancakes.\n\nAs for the parking, the parking opposite the main yard is a dust fest. Hottest day (and night) of the year and having to have windows open means your cab will get covered in dust. Really can’t be good to be breathing all that in. How hard would it be to tarmac the parking area. I’ve read reviews on what it’s like when it’s raining. Getting WiFi whilst parked is nice however to plus points on that.\n\nAll in all I doubt I’ll stay here again.",

I asked about it, and the staff immediately moved me to another room with a locker – super fast and helpful! The room was clean, and I liked that the bathroom and toilet were separate. The staff were extremely friendly and always ready to help. Another big plus is that you can leave your luggage after check-out until your departure, which was very convenient.\n\nIn the bathroom, there were no hooks or space to put personal belongings, which was a bit uncomfortable.

Another big plus is that you can leave your luggage after check-out until your departure, which was very convenient.\n\nIn the bathroom, there were no hooks or space to put personal belongings, which was a bit uncomfortable. The pillows were also quite thin and not very comfortable to sleep on.",

I didn’t know this was permitted and it was a little disruptive.\nGeneral chit chat can easily be heard from the stairways while in the dorm( I stayed on the first floor).\nThe windows were not double glazed so noise from the street can easily be heard.\nThe keycard that enabled room access kept needing to be rebooted. I was lucky that I was on the 1st floor and it was only a short walk back to the reception. This happened frequently with the others in my dorm room too.\nOverall, it’s a decent stay for the price you pay.",

Took the screw and photos of broken shower to reception at around 5:30pm - staff member was polite but offered no solutions or apologies; simply said we'd have to manage because maintenance had gone home for the night. I replied that I would not use the shower as it was, well, unusable.\n\nIt gets very loud, especially in the evenings, and whilst the photos show lots of facilities, in actuality there is not much available to use.\n\nThe room itself was basically tidy although the carpet was not very clean and if I'm honest, I'd book the YHA instead next time - I would have done so this time but they were fully booked.\n\nI feel quite disappointed with the stay overall but I guess you pay cheap, you get cheap. For somewhere to crash after a night out I'd say it's brilliant; it's close to everything, you can just roll in and pass out accordingly. But for anything else? Perhaps book elsewhere...this was a last resort booking to see Jack Whitehall as our previous hotel had let us down.\n\nWon't use again, but that's just because it didn't meet my needs or expectations.

Well priced and good portions 100% recommended, also what a brilliant location. Hatton Gardens is in a quieter part of town but a brilliant walking distance from all the good stuff. Also if you tell the cafe you're staying at the hotel they give you a cheeky discount. The room itself was cute looking at first glance but when you looked closer you could see it needed a couple of minor improvements and a fresh lick of paint, especially around the bed so I couldn't help but stare at all the dents, scratches and chipped paint. My biggest annoyance however was the ensuite. It's a bit of a joke to pay for an ensuite room, where the toilet doesn't flush very well and wake up and find the water freezing and having to either go without or hunt for the communal shower room, which when we complained we were told there was one on every floor. That's cool and all but if you wanted to share a bathroom you'd pay for it right? I don't think the complaint was handled very well and was kind of brushed off. As well as we weren't really told about the cool facilities in the hotel, just kinda stumbled across them looking for the shower eg laundry room a pool table and apparently a library! Could have been super cute budget place but kinda more for pics and nothing too impressive. Didn't feel worth it.",

          "reviewText": "My stay at the Malacuna Hotel, Liverpool (29th August – 2nd September 2025), was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. The accommodation was completely misrepresented online, the property was undergoing disruptive refurbishment without any prior notice, and the basic room conditions were unacceptable.\n\nMisleading Advertising\n\nThe room I was given looked nothing like the photos shown on booking platforms. Instead of a clean, modern space, I walked into a dirty, poorly maintained room. The floor had hair and debris, the sink had dirty water stains, and the overall condition was shabby. The amenities advertised online were simply not provided — no heating, no hand wash, no coat hangers, and generally nothing resembling what was promised.\n\nRefurbishment (Undisclosed and Hazardous)\n\nThe hotel was essentially a building site. There was wet paint, construction equipment scattered in common areas, and a strong paint smell that caused headaches. I even got paint on my clothes because areas weren’t marked or signposted properly. None of this was disclosed before or at booking, and when I asked, I was told there were no other rooms available, so no chance of moving or upgrading. The whole environment felt unsafe and uncomfortable, and it was completely unacceptable not to inform guests in advance.\n\nPoor Room Conditions & Safety Concerns\n\nOn top of the misleading presentation, the room itself was simply not fit for purpose. Walls were paper-thin, cleanliness was non-existent on arrival, and the space lacked very basic facilities.\n\nEven worse, during two of the nights, around 4am, someone was banging on doors, trying door handles, and shouting “Owen.” This was frightening and hugely disruptive, making it impossible to feel safe or comfortable in the room. Combined with the lack of staff presence and security, this created a genuinely unsafe environment for guests.\n\nAdditional Concerns\n•\tBasic facilities unavailable: On Saturday evening around 9pm, no drinks were available because their iPad system was down. No alternative was offered.\n•\tSecurity risks: Doors to the property were left wide open with no staff or security on site. Strangers were able to walk in freely, making the environment unsafe.\n•\tNo staff presence: Reception was unattended throughout my stay, leaving guests without assistance. This only increased the feeling of being unsafe.\n•\tPrivacy breach: A guest report listing names and room numbers was left in clear view at reception. Even worse, staff entered my room unannounced while I was sleeping, to drop off towels and toilet roll. This is an obvious breach of privacy and completely unprofessional.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nThis stay was unacceptable in every way. What was advertised bore no resemblance to the reality. Guests were left to deal with unsafe, dirty, and poorly managed conditions without staff support. The combination of misleading advertising, undisclosed refurbishment, substandard room conditions, and serious safety incidents makes this hotel a place I cannot recommend to anyone.\n\nI have requested a full refund and compensation for the health, safety, and comfort issues I endured and will be escalating this matter through booking platforms and consumer rights authorities.",

The amenities advertised online were simply not provided — no heating, no hand wash, no coat hangers, and generally nothing resembling what was promised.\n\nRefurbishment (Undisclosed and Hazardous)\n\nThe hotel was essentially a building site. There was wet paint, construction equipment scattered in common areas, and a strong paint smell that caused headaches. I even got paint on my clothes because areas weren’t marked or signposted properly. None of this was disclosed before or at booking, and when I asked, I was told there were no other rooms available, so no chance of moving or upgrading. The whole environment felt unsafe and uncomfortable, and it was completely unacceptable not to inform guests in advance.\n\nPoor Room Conditions & Safety Concerns\n\nOn top of the misleading presentation, the room itself was simply not fit for purpose. Walls were paper-thin, cleanliness was non-existent on arrival, and the space lacked very basic facilities.\n\nEven worse, during two of the nights, around 4am, someone was banging on doors, trying door handles, and shouting “Owen.” This was frightening and hugely disruptive, making it impossible to feel safe or comfortable in the room. Combined with the lack of staff presence and security, this created a genuinely unsafe environment for guests.\n\nAdditional Concerns\n•\tBasic facilities unavailable: On Saturday evening around 9pm, no drinks were available because their iPad system was down. No alternative was offered.\n•\tSecurity risks: Doors to the property were left wide open with no staff or security on site. Strangers were able to walk in freely, making the environment unsafe.\n•\tNo staff presence: Reception was unattended throughout my stay, leaving guests without assistance. This only increased the feeling of being unsafe.\n•\tPrivacy breach: A guest report listing names and room numbers was left in clear view at reception. Even worse, staff entered my room unannounced while I was sleeping, to drop off towels and toilet roll. This is an obvious breach of privacy and completely unprofessional.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nThis stay was unacceptable in every way. What was advertised bore no resemblance to the reality. Guests were left to deal with unsafe, dirty, and poorly managed conditions without staff support. The combination of misleading advertising, undisclosed refurbishment, substandard room conditions, and serious safety incidents makes this hotel a place I cannot recommend to anyone.\n\nI have requested a full refund and compensation for the health, safety, and comfort issues I endured and will be escalating this matter through booking platforms and consumer rights authorities.",

The downside and reason that stops us from staying here again was it was it was unfortunately extremely noisy during the night. We stayed in room 231 and not sure if we just got unlucky with this room but there was music and dancing going on above us till late and there was a door near our room literally getting slammed at all hours of the night. Any time we managed to fall asleep this door would slam again and startle us back awake, I have read on other reviews that this seems to be an issue with this hotel. It also wasn't helped that the shower went off in the middle of the night and the TV must have had an alarm set on it as it turned on and started blasting the Simpsons at 8am. We got maybe 1-2 hours sleep if that. I think little things such as door softeners could be useful here and signage to remind people in hallways not to shout and run around in the middle of the night. Would be tempted to stay again due to the staff being so lovely and the room being very decent but we'd be 100% be bringing ear plugs next time!",

If you are a budget traveller, this is definitely a place that you could consider staying at. Very cheap; you can get a room for as low as £20/night. Also, the location is great. The hostel is close to the heart of the city. It is located on the border of the heart of the city and Chinatown, so when you leave the building, depending on whether you turn left or right, you'll get to your destination within 5-10 minutes of walk. And that's pretty much it. These are the ONLY positive aspects of Arena House.\n\n1. If you are travelling heavy, cross this hostel off your list. There is no lift in the building, so I had to drag 30kgs of luggage up 3 flights of stairs to the room which I was assigned to.\n\n2. Lack of hygiene in the private rooms & communal areas is just revolting. When I got to my room, I was shocked to discover the layers of dust behind the bed.\nThere was a pack of bread in the kitchen cupboard that was encased with mould suggesting there were no cleaners present in weeks.\nThe 2 bathrooms we shared on the top floor were rancid. The bathtub had dried (I assume) dirt covering the bottom, bins were overflowing with used toilet paper & hygiene pads and NO clean toilet paper whatsoever. And to top that, toilet water was leaking all over the floor.\n\n3. Sockets in my room were placed behind the bed which is fine, so long you can move the bed and access it. This is NOT the case. The bed is fixated to the floor and you can't charge anything because the bedframe is in the way of the cables.\n\n4. Poor quality of service. If you're lucky enough, you manage to get connected to a staff that is unresponsive but at least it's a staff member. In most cases, however, you can't reach anyone as reception closes at 4PM and they are not really handy with picking up phones.\n\nMy final verdict is ...\n\nif you are a budget traveller, who does not mind spending a night or 2 in a messy, dusty university accommodation - YES, go for it;\n\nin any other case - NO, avoid it like the plague; I regret not spending a few pounds more to have a decent room and a clean bathroom/toilet facility that I am not afraid of using.",

You can get the bus or train to Liverpool from here within a short walk. We travelled to West kirby. Moreton & Liverpool docks. I'm sure plenty of other locations are available. The campsite offers seperate shower block for men and women which are very clean and the showers are warm and are not restricted on time. Hooks available for clothing in the showers with big mirrors which i know us ladies appreciate. No sockets in showers though. They have toilet emptying facilities. Washing pot facilities. Electric hook up if needed. Water top up. We arrived in June 2023. Pretty flat pitches and all is grass. Phone signals are great too. Trevor is always on site and nothing is any trouble if you need anything. We came here 9 years ago and we will definitely return. Thank you Trevor. Very peaceful and beautiful site.

If your ordering a takeaway do not use Pizza Pan over 1hour 15min waiting for delivery and then arrived to wrong location, in the summer season the onsite café is open later so we would eat there if we stay during those months  but as its winter it closed at 4pm but can see why due to demand.",

Shower block was very smelly, toilet paper strewn all over, and I’m pretty sure the ceiling has been shot with a pellet gun at some point! It’s also a loud site, not good when trying to put a 2 year old to bed, and also under a flight path to John Lennon airport, again not brilliant for the toddler. It was very dusty, gravel bumpy roads meant the pram and dog were filthy every time we went out. We also came back to our pitch to see a dog had pee’d on our awning, We were next to a caravan that seemed to be there on a seasonal pitch, and the lad inside smoked weed morning noon and night, again not ideal when kids are around. I paid £10 for WIFI for the three nights which was a total waste of money, it barely worked once. The bins were always overflowing, and litter everywhere around our pitch. We ordered takeout bacon sandwiches, 2 pieces of bacon in a very dry bun, not worth the money. Staff are friendly and didn’t have to wait long to be served,  and quirky little shops and stalls are nice to look around. Overall, we won’t be returning, run down, worn out, and in need of some investment.",

Can't comment on toilet and wash facilities as we always use our own.\nHowever... we are currently staying on a commercial site in a\"hot\" tourist site with a larger, fully serviced pitches with free high speed WiFi for about the same cost per night. CAMC seems to have forgotten that it is a member's club and is trying to compete at least on pricing with the likes of Haven.",

There are small slides for under 5s and little seating areas in the water. There were a lot of people play fighting in the pool, which I personally didn't like as you kept having to make sure you avoid them. The changing rooms are also large and there are 4 family changing rooms, but you can't then access the hairdryers etc from them, you have to go into the single sex changing rooms, which is tricky for father and daughter to do. Instead of lockers, they have a basket system where you put all your clothes and towels in a basket, hand it over, and get a wristband. There is a second more traditional 25m pool for swim lessons and kayak and various other training things. The cafe has been refurbished and also has a lot of seating areas. There isn't always a member of staff to serve you. You have to press a silent button and wait in hope, between 1 and 5 mins, for someone to appear and serve you. The sports hall is well kept and multi purpose, I saw pickleball and trampolining when I was there. The gym is upstairs, which I didn't see but was very popular. Parking is next to the arena.",

There are small slides for under 5s and little seating areas in the water. There were a lot of people play fighting in the pool, which I personally didn't like as you kept having to make sure you avoid them. The changing rooms are also large and there are 4 family changing rooms, but you can't then access the hairdryers etc from them, you have to go into the single sex changing rooms, which is tricky for father and daughter to do. Instead of lockers, they have a basket system where you put all your clothes and towels in a basket, hand it over, and get a wristband. There is a second more traditional 25m pool for swim lessons and kayak and various other training things. The cafe has been refurbished and also has a lot of seating areas. There isn't always a member of staff to serve you. You have to press a silent button and wait in hope, between 1 and 5 mins, for someone to appear and serve you. The sports hall is well kept and multi purpose, I saw pickleball and trampolining when I was there. The gym is upstairs, which I didn't see but was very popular. Parking is next to the arena.",

There should be at least a couple of cubicles for those who wish to use them. There are family change cubicles but the queue for these is always rather large.\nDuring the casual swim, the lifeguards were not enforcing the swim lanes, which is an area 'cordoned off' from the family pool to allow people who wish to swim lengths to do so. It probably makes more sense to do away with the swim lanes during the casual swim if it isn't going to be enforced. This in turn means people can spread out more in the pool as it feels very cramped particularly at busy times.\nOverall I recommend. It has it's issues but it is a CIC so isn't purely about profit.\nParking is free for customers for up to 3 hours.",

The changing facilities are good for families with specific family changing rooms, and there is lots of space.\nIt was clean and warm in the changing areas. The pool was cool, not too cold, but not warm. It is clear that no money has been put back in to the place because it has not changed in years. The slide was not working and the place looks absolutely nothing like it shows on the website or on Google images. It is very run down compared to most other pools that we have been to.\nDespite that, we had a good hour long swim and then had lunch in the cafe which was nice. We didn't wait long at all, and the food was served hot - it was enjoyed by us all.",

We planned to visit Tumble Tots (soft play in the sports hall) then go for a swim but when we arrived we were advised that we could only go to the under 5s session in the pool so had to miss most of Tumble Tots to make the pool session. Doesn’t make sense that these sessions overlap really? It also wasn’t completely clear why we had to go to the under 5s session, there is a baby area in the pool so surely we can just use this at anytime? We might have missed something\n\nTumble Tots was fantastic. Great value. Lots to do & good atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately we can’t say the same for the pool experience. The pool was sectioned off into lanes & the deeper end looked to be out of service. We wanted to go swimming properly but the baby / shallow end of the  pool is not deep enough to swim so it’s more just playing in water. The water was very chilly, we had a 45 minute session but the baby was too cold / shaking so we left after under 30 minutes\n\nThe pool hasn’t been updated since I last visited. Definitely in desperate need of an update. The changing rooms were very outdated / pretty grim. I’m not sure how a mum alone with baby would be able to visit, luckily I had another helper with me. I wasn’t able to put baby down in the changing rooms as the playpen provided had no padding / bottom to it, just a tiled / concrete floor. If you’re alone with a baby you can’t carry baby & the box with all your stuff. There isn’t a locker system just a big plastic box you carry to the poolside. This just doesn’t work for parents of under 1s",

A group of us were literally kicked out for “inappropriate footwear,” even though we were wearing normal trainers with ZERO mud—no wet mud, no dry mud, nothing. Just the usual light dust any shoe has from walking outside. Yet we were accused of making a mess, which was a complete lie.\n\nThe woman working at around 3 o’clock was unbelievably rude from the moment she approached us. She repeatedly talked down to us, accused us of dirtying the gym, and refused to listen to anything we said. Her attitude was unprofessional, aggressive, and absolutely unacceptable for someone working in customer service—especially in a place charging such high membership fees.\n\nTo make it even worse, several other members were kicked out for the exact same false reason. None of us had muddy shoes. Not one. This makes their actions even more ridiculous and shows how poorly managed this gym really is.\n\nWe even offered to go outside and wash our shoes, but she refused and demanded we leave immediately. No conversation. No respect. Just arrogance and attitude.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the facility:\n•\tThe gym is already dirty, with floors that definitely don’t look like they’re cleaned regularly.\n•\tThe gym is cramped, poorly maintained, and simply not worth the money members are paying.\n•\tOn top of that, the place is understaffed, and the call wait times are ridiculous—good luck trying to get help or speak to anyone without waiting forever.\n\nFor what they charge every month, this level of treatment is beyond insulting. It’s embarrassing. If they put even half as much effort into cleaning the gym as they do into falsely accusing members, maybe the place wouldn’t be in such poor condition.\n\nI strongly recommend avoiding Brio Christleton Gym. Between the rude staff, the unprofessional behaviour of the 3 o’clock employee, the lack of cleanliness, the understaffing, and the unjustified harassment of paying members, this gym is absolutely not worth your time or money.",

I have been sending my son to swimming lessons here. I have nothing but positive things to say about the two teachers he has been with, however because of his autistic tendencies (going through official assessment) he refuses to participate with teachers he is not comfortable with, it took a few weeks to get him comfortable with the teachers he likes. those teachers are on leave(subs have been supplied but never met my son) and we requested a pause of his membership which is only 3 sessions over a month or two. My family is very disabled and as such were on benefits so these lessons are quite expensive for us, something were happy to provide for my son but still not something we can easily waste money on. The lessons and teachers are great but the unwillingness of the leadership to accommodate (which is there right) autistic individuals speaks highly of how they think and feel to those in need. Asking an autistic person to simply get over there issues is tantamount to asking a wheel chair user to simply use the stairs. My recommendation is if you have an autistic child or dependent to avoid this company and find somewhere that are willing and understand what it to teach and look after different issues.",

The only facilities for me (a woman) to take my children are up two flights of stairs. My baby was in the pushchair and when I asked the receptionist how I was supposed to get upstairs with the pushchair while carrying my toddler she asked why didn’t the seat of my pushchair unclip. I even had offers from some lovely users of the pool to look after my toddler while I took the baby upstairs but I am not comfortable with leaving my child with a stranger. I was told I couldn’t use the pool changing as I can’t take the pushchair in there which makes it incredibly difficult to carry both toddler, baby and the nappy bag. I shouldn’t be made to feel that I cannot take two small children in nappies out to places by myself that are made for children and I find it hard to believe this has never been raised as an issue before.",

The metal work along the windows and walls is rusty and covered in chipped paint with caution/duct tape all over them.\n\nThere is a free friend Friday at this place but I doubt I’d bring anyone here to swim.\n\nA pro of this place is that the pool is warm, the gym is good and the staff are really friendly so there’s no fault there.",

It’s a bit awkward when you’re changing for the sauna or showers because there are only two private cubicles.\nToday I was in the sauna for about 20 minutes and on three separate occasions during that time a man came in, either to clean or for a security check. They always announce themselves and I understand that male members of staff may need to enter, but could you not at least try to have a woman doing it? Or maybe make it a little less frequent?\nIt’s interesting that Jeff below has had a similar experience.

The water is heated, although still cold, but perfect for wetsuit swimming if you're into open water swimming - many people brave it without wetsuits fine tho! Its nice and quiet over winter so you get a lane to yourself, unlike packed indoor pools. The pool is now considerably clearer than summer too and the hot showers and clean changing rooms help with it getting colder into winter.\nThank you Lido team who are keeping it open and clean, looking forward to the new additional facilities being added soon!",

I'd like it to be economically viable. But stop shy of busy! But if the recent queues are anything to go by then I'm going to be disappointed!\n\nI come for the morning swim session before the crowds. There are nine lanes. Three each for fast, medium and slow. And the good people of Guildford are wonderfully accommodating of speed differences within those lanes.\n\nThe staff do a remarkable job of keeping the pool clean. Occasionally there are unattractive clumps of matted hair at the bottom. There's the inevitable sand or grit that collects. And it's not immune to a stray plaster. But I think they've got themselves an underwater hoover because it's looking good at the moment. And for someone who spends 45 minutes with his head down looking at the bottom, that's a much more pleasant view.\n\nI'm surprised there are only two male showers. I may have missed the others. But in the morning I've only had to wait a couple of times for them to become free. The lack of bike storage is scandalous for a leisure organisation. This gets used up very quicky in the morning session. There are four bike stands on the left hand side of the entrance and four spaces for bikes on the right hand side if they're not instructed by mopeds. Apparently there are plans to improve bike parking.\n\nThis place is a real gem. It's brightened my first summer in Guildford.",

We booked in advance on the website for an early morning lane swim as this is a popular pool and sessions can reach capacity. The pool is fairly wide (about 16m), with 4 lanes (slow/ medium-slow/ medium-fast/ fast) which work really well as there is plenty of room to swim breaststroke and even overtake within each lane. There is also a smaller pool for younger kids. The main pool has a small water slide, plus a low diving board, which are open during the casual swim sessions. Staff are friendly + 2 attentive lifeguards at either side of the pool. There is limited free parking at the pool, but there is an additional free car park along the road. There are traditional changing cubicles, which are clean, warm outdoor showers, and a relatively new toilet block. Lockers are available (£1 refundable), and there's a small tuck shop on site. Definitely a pool worth visiting 🤗",

Sections of the pool, which is an irregular shape, are divided into  slides/splash area, an area for families, and a section for lane swimming.

We went for an early morning lane swim - there were only 4 of us in the pool, so plenty of space and the local/regular swimmers made us feel really welcome (even giving us 'Friends of Aldershot Lido' swimming caps, which were a lovely souvenir of our visit). The laned section of the pool is about 25-30m & fairly deep. Pool is well maintained and lovely to see the traditional fountain in operation. Changing facilities are basic but clean & clean toilets and hot showers. Lockers available poolside, but bring padlock. Overall we really enjoyed our visit 😊",

Tom has set me on track for losing weight steadily, toning up and being able to enjoy running/cycling/swimming etc more because I'm stronger and fitter. Been going 3 times a week for 5 weeks and already my runs feel totally different. I'm so grateful. Tom is so good at helping me push myself hard but being kind with it. Synergy has the feel of a family of friends encouraging each other on and this helps too. I recommend this place daily to people!",

Furthermore I found the inside of the service station to be exactly as I've come to expect from a services. Unfortunately nothing sets it apart from the others but that's not to say there's anything wrong with it. I had a burger king meal, someone tried to claim it as their own when the number was called out but I can't put that on the service station, the good lady had a wrap from M&S which was likely fine. I've marked the services down a star because I used the wash room and found the smell to be rather pungent, of unrine. Now this isn't uncommon I know and probably expected, I'm willing to review this later on in life when I return. But until then it's a soild 4.

Arriving on a wet busy Twixmas afternoon, the service station was really busy, floors wet, tables needed a clean down and the general feeling was pretty meh. That said, I can imagine on a warm summers day with more people sitting outside it may have an entirely different feeling to the place. But our visit, on this day, was just a bit meh. Long queue to get into the car park to find there were in fact lots of spaces but the layout meant people parking caused tailbacks. Three staff wearing hi vis, apparently there to assist with parking, standing doing nothing. Two on their phones, one standing with a sign stating Spaces Here but not holding it aloft meant no one could see it.  The bathrooms were wet and there were papers littered on the floor in the cubicle, with a wet seat and not in the best condition as a result. We’ve all been there, and even hourly checks would have struggled to keep the cloakrooms up to scratch on a wet busy day, and ultimately, it’s down to the users to make an effort. Visited the food shop and grabbed a burger meal (dry burger and bland fries)and staff were pretty indifferent.  The service station itself provided a service but it’s a splash and dash, not one I would want to take a break at, particularly compared with others on the same south to north road trip.",

Staff are very friendly and helpful. Semi-decent place to stay if you have enough money to not have to care about how you waste it. Unfortunately, it is absolutely not worth the money, especially considering they up the price every year. Wouldn't have been worth it three years ago when the prices were lower anyway.",

They were patient and understanding, sympathetic of the issues of tenants this negative review is absolutely no slight against these hard working people, rather the shambolic, exploitative company they work for. It is a shame that such nice people work for a shockingly bad rental company who is demonstrably not concerned about anything aside from your money going into their bank.\nThe first issue I experienced during my stay was a roof leak, water leaking through my light fitting, cutting off my lights for often months at a time. Months later at the end of my tenancy this still was unresolved. To compound this flagrant disregard for my living conditions the whole building was without hot water for a month during winter. Upon reviewing other reviews on Google, this has been an issue for years!!! And it STILL remains unresolved!? The sheer arrogance to expect you to live with out the basic necessity of hot running water whilst taking your money and not offering any recompense is absolutely diabolical.\nI cannot find words strong enough for my displeasure with Xenia as a company. I truly feel sympathy for its employees who are forced to bear responsibility for the immense shortcomings of those in charge of maintaining the living standards of students in Chronicle House.

And I was in care as a child :/\n\nI never really make negative reviews as often I think they are over exaggerated. But genuinely, I would never stay here again.\n\nI felt like the staff never cared about any of the students staying here, despite being so kind and friendly before moving in.\n\nThe wifi is terrible, the TV in my room was so outdated that I couldn’t use Netflix. The drawers were broken and pathetically ‘fixed’ back on so they didn’t even close properly. My heating didn’t work during winter and they took months to fix it despite my consistent emails and phone calls asking for help.\n\nThey only fixed it when I eventually withheld my rent. They charge you £30+ to come let you back in your flat, even though it can take them over 12 hours to let you back in. The hot water didn’t work for weeks on end. They didn’t care enough to fix this or really sincerely apologise.\n\nThe rent is insanely high for such terrible service and poor quality rooms. When I moved in, my shower didn’t work because they had taken the parts of my shower (on/off knob) and given it to someone else. They just put the metal casing back on thinking I wouldn’t notice lol. They also took the fuses out of some of my fuse boxes, including the extractor fan above the hobs.\n\nThey kept ringing to tell me I was in arrears with my rent because I hadn’t paid enough/ on the correct date. However, I had paid £600 per month on the same date as told to by a member of their staff and in email, only to be told that this amount of money was incorrect and that I was supposed to be paying it at the end of the month instead of the start. They forced me to pay twice in the same month meaning I ended up paying £1350 altogether as I had also been told I was underpaying my rent.\n\nFinally, they refused to give me access to my mailbox for months and kept promising me a key. At this point I was paying council tax but was told to wait for the letter stating how to pay it (the letter had my tax number on which I needed to set up an account), however I never received the letter because it was in the letterbox that I was unable to access. The receptionist told me that she would hold on to any of my letters and give me them but obviously that never happened. I was fined almost £100 for not paying my tax on time.\n\nHonestly this place has made me incredibly stressed and I will never recommend, nor live in a Xenia students building again.",

Then the entire building had no hot water for twelve day in January. One of other student called the head office to complain and they were surprised to learn about this.

During this period there was a complete lack of communication about the problem.\nThen there was an electrical fire in the gym late at night, meaning the entire building had to be evacuated. None of the staff came down to check if the students were alright and left everything to the student rep. Again, the gym was closed for an extended period of time and the common room heaters have only been fixed a week or so ago. The fire was in January. We then learn that there are no fire extinguishers in the entire building, despite the fact that it is in the contract.\nThere have been no offers to refund any of our money (water and electricity is included in our rent), which inconvenient seeing as I have already paid for the whole year (international student). It is also exceedingly difficult to contact someone who can actually do anything, as Fortis Student is part of a property group with members from other property developments (e.g. Fortis Development, Fortis Estate Management, Elite Property Group and Beaumont Morgan), making it difficult to figure out who is actually in charge.\nDo not go here.",

It all started with a burst pipe in the ceiling of the first floor, which flooded the first and ground floor, the gym and the common room. Which meant living inside a building site for two weeks, for which they could only apologise for the inconvenience. A second leak occurred not too much later on the Second floor and following on from that another leak in the gym. It is only January and now and the hot water is not working for the entire building. It has been like this for the past week. I can confirm cold showers are not nice at 7am. I am however happy with the room, and as long as nothing else goes wrong for the next 6 months of my time here it is a nice location to stay in. Other things to mention are; the website advertises table tennis which doesn't exist and regular social events which happened once when we moved in and haven't heard of since. Overall i'm not impressed with the management of events that occurred as there just didn't seem to be much urgency. Also no compensation for the lack of services we were still paying for. If you plan on living here i hope you don't have the same experience as me.\nAn update a month after i wrote this, the building suffered an electrical fire in the gym radiator and we all had evacuate for an evening while fire crews dealt with this issue. No management for the building showed up that night to see if we were all ok, the student representative was left to deal with it all. I hate living with the worry something will go wrong again soon.",

Good study area and communal spaces with a pool table, games, vending machine etc. lovely canal view. There is only approx 6 washing machines and dryers to share between hundreds of people. Living here was a horrible experience. Some staff were lovely and helpful. Other staff were horribly rude and unhelpful. The prices were extortionate and continually rising year on year. I had problems with contracts not being sorted properly and being scammed out of thousands due to no one communicating with each other. Them constantly changing management allowed them to get away with it because they know it’s not easy for students to find somewhere to go mid term.  Constant gaslighting by the staff. I would recommend anyone staying here to ensure they get absolutely anything they communicate with you in writing or they will lie about it. Don’t allow maintenance issues to go unresolved because you’re paying a lot of money for that service. My living conditions were poor and instead of being understood I was blamed and gaslighted. Problems would take months to be resolved with poor communication. Wouldn’t recommend it but it’s a great place location wise so just be wary.",

You may even get visited by a couple of really cute and friendly dogs!\n\nI'm currently planning an Offa's Dyke Path adventure, which I'll finish off by walking home from Prestatyn, and I'm fully planning to make a stop here on the way home. I can't think of a more perfect place to have as my last camping stop.",

They should be very proud of the high standards they are providing for their guests. There is 10amp EHU at excellent Kwh prices. 20pence for a 3 minute HOT shower 40p for 6 minutes etc. Etc 2 toilets BONUS is a utility area for washing pots. Grounds are extremely well kept. Facilities are Beautifully clean. Terry and Jean go out of their way to ensure you have a memorable stay. Flint is close by and definitely worth the 30 minute drive to reach an excellent estury to walk around . Castle ruins on the grass hill. X30 bus to Chester 2mins from the site gate approx 11 minute journey. Breathtaking Cathedral in Chester. WIDE ENTRANCE which provides easy access into the site. Love the fact the dog owners have to take their beloved dog to the near by dog walk and use the doggy bins thus avoiding other campers from stepping into a mess. Thank you Terry and Jean for 4 perfect night stays.",

In the centre of the pitches there is a shelter with very long hoses to fill your water, and an Elsen point. Waste water had to be taken from the pitch in a container which was fine. There are male and female toilets, each had 1 shower and 2 toilets. These weren't heated but they were very clean and tidy.\nThe walk from the site into Chester was along the canal and took about 50 minutes.\nWe would definitely go back to this site as it was small, very well looked after and very quiet.

          "reviewText": "A \"back to basics\" experience that turned out to be a bit too basic for me, but could suit others.\n\nWe primarily picked this location due to being close to Mouldsworth train station; unfortunately though the \"reception\" (really just a farmhouse) was a breezy 10 mins from the station, it turned out the actual campsite was another 10 minutes past that (the Google Maps pin is for the reception, the campsite is at the end of Stable Lane). For us as backpackers with no car this was a little more than we'd been expecting to walk with the heavy packs.\n\nThe actual campsite is divided into two areas, and sits on a hillside sandwiched between a sheep field and a horse field. By the entrance is a basic but clean toilet block, with one shower. On one side of the toilets, further down the slope, there is a small lake reserved for fishers; you aren't allowed to walk around the lake unless you are there to fish, which was disappointing. On the other side, going up, there is the campsite. There are a few caravan gravel pitches which were all taken while we were there on a Sunday night, and further up the slope there are two large fields to take your pick of. There are no labelled pitches, you can simply pitch anywhere.\n\nThe surroundings are beautiful and peaceful, there are a few picnic tables dotted around for you to use, a barbeque and even a basic tree swing.\n\nMy main issue was the distance from the toilet, I have what you might call a finicky bladder but there was no real way for us to pitch close to the loos. The campsite owner was very friendly and helpful but got around in a very loud little off-road vehicle which sometimes broke the peace at random times, as you never knew when he was going to show up. When we pitched he said he was planning to mow that field the next day but would mow around our tent, that made me a little nervous, though I understand he has to mow sometime.\n\nIn the end I could see this being an ideal campsite for someone else but sadly was just a little too basic for me. If I had a car and there was another toilet block at the top of the campsite I think I would happily return.",

In our party were 2 tents & 2 caravans but wouldn't recommend this site for people in tents. No hot water tap working in what was a very basic hut with just 1 toilet, 1 shower & 1 sink in the ladies, that weren't cleaned the whole time we were there. Also no washing up facilities 1st campsite I've ever been on with no washing up facilities & I've camped on many sites in the last 12 years. When I mentioned this to the owner he seemed very surprised this was an issue & when I mentioned about no hot water to wash hands & face with etc,  his reply was to use my friends caravan!! Therefore don't camp there unless you go with people who have a caravan!! It's a real shame because if just a little bit of money was spent on this site it could be amazing but sadly we won't be visiting it again",

There is one toilet and one shower with no loo roll, soap etc and it’s quite far from where you actually camp - bit of a pain if you need to go in the middle of the night!\nThe other big issue is that’s most of the other people were in caravans - mostly big groups of adults who stayed up until after 1am loudly playing techno music on outside speakers, swearing and arguing. It was a bank holiday when we stayed so might not be an issue at other times but there were no notices asking people to be mindful of noise after a certain time as we have seen at other sites which was a real shame as we could hear everything in the tent - the ground was literally thumping! Probably great if you’re up for a party but if you’re just looking to relax or have a quiet night away as a family then this might not be the place for you.",

We receive a PCN Fine for £100 and are informed that I was in the car park for 1 minute 20 seconds too long!  Is it a customer car park or is it not a customer car park??? I was a customer going in and out of the car park.  How grossly disgusting is it to fine a customer £100 for being in a customer car park! So 50 minutes of swimming has now become £111 (people cannot afford this kind of stupidity at this moment in time). Suffice to say we'll never return and you will lose any future income and I will tell all family and friends and anyone I talk to avoid this nasty place.  It's old and tired and dirty anyway so just go to Swim Central instead of this revolting place!  They trick you by not making the parking rules clearer - it's not visible enough on their website, the email booking that you actually read has no information about this, it's not clear in the car park there is a camera and if you are going in with kids you'll likely be too distracted to see the kiosk.  I think that the management of this place needs to get their heads examined as the customer should be treated nicely and they are just going to end up closed - I think that this place needs to get shut down.  You can see it's decline in the reviews on various sites - it's useless! They are no help with the parking fine and from reading other people experiences customers are treated horribly - it's just not the way to behave when running a business.  It's totally shameful and utterly disgusting in everyway!  You need to make some changes starting with getting rid of that parking camera.  The company that runs the parking camera has no way of contacting them (not email and you can't talk to them 1-2-1 on the phone) so they hide digitally and you cannot even try and get a resolution.  I reckon they ignore the appeals and let the fines get bigger and bigger for their own benefit - these two are in the scam together. Do not go to this leisure centre - stay clear of it - they don't care about their customers at all - you're just a cash cow! I hope this place gets closed down! It's the most disgusting experience ever!!!",

They trick you by not making the parking rules clearer - it's not visible enough on their website, the email booking that you actually read has no information about this, it's not clear in the car park there is a camera and if you are going in with kids you'll likely be too distracted to see the kiosk.  I think that the management of this place needs to get their heads examined as the customer should be treated nicely and they are just going to end up closed - I think that this place needs to get shut down.  You can see it's decline in the reviews on various sites - it's useless! They are no help with the parking fine and from reading other people experiences customers are treated horribly - it's just not the way to behave when running a business.  It's totally shameful and utterly disgusting in everyway!  You need to make some changes starting with getting rid of that parking camera.  The company that runs the parking camera has no way of contacting them (not email and you can't talk to them 1-2-1 on the phone) so they hide digitally and you cannot even try and get a resolution.  I reckon they ignore the appeals and let the fines get bigger and bigger for their own benefit - these two are in the scam together. Do not go to this leisure centre - stay clear of it - they don't care about their customers at all - you're just a cash cow! I hope this place gets closed down! It's the most disgusting experience ever!!!",

New changing rooms look miles better but they were about 6 years overdue. Please invest in some more chairs for parents swimming lesson viewing... I'd recommend get rid of the children's mini chairs and replace them with adult ones. Finally there needs to be more 'general swims' at the weekend.. if I want to bring 1 child instead of the whole family, I have to pay the full family of 4 rate... which is silly as my child gets in free due to having swim lessons. It just isn't logical. Staff are all very lovely and friendly and extremely helpful, but the place still needs more investment and running better.",

After ~ 2 months of once weekly lessons I’ve graduated :) Becca and Zara in particular have been great in helping me improve, giving me insightful feedback and meaningful instructions. I now do lane swimming a couple of times a week to get the practice in. I’ve never found the sessions too busy, either morning or evening.\n\nSo as summary … easy to get to, ample parking, fresh clean facilities, good instructors and never feels too busy.

When I first joined, there was a consistent peak time at around 5-6pm. Now, that peak time seems to stretch from 4-8pm with not enough equipment throughout to facilitate the influx of new members. Obviously I understand that the upper management are trying to pack in as many members in as possible but the outdated machines and lack of free weights makes for a subpar experience at best.\n\nI am lucky enough to be on a friends and family membership which meant that I pay £51 however, I recently got an email stating that my next payment will be £63. The email justifies this by saying we have had investment into the club. This ‘investment’ however, has only included 3 new racks and a couple of kettle bells here and there. Everything else in the gym feels like it is either second hand or still there from the early 2000’s. We were told there would be stair masters by the beginning of December, but nothing.\n\nThe pool area overall feels unclean, almost slimy and the steam room absolutely stinks of mould all of the time. The changing rooms are outdated, like something from a 1990’s leisure club. The showers are vile, slimy and full of hair. The lifeguards are polite and respectful but that is about it.\n\nHaving spoken to many members across the gym, I know that not many are planning on staying. Nuffield Management need to find a way to make this club worth paying the hiked prices otherwise they will forcing the old members out and only staying afloat through no joining fee offers. I will be taking my membership across to another gym as soon as this membership runs out.\n\nI have already sent an email to management about this but they are not bothered about members leaving. I just got an email back basically saying ‘we have actioned this’ and nothing more. They are clearly more bothered about quick fixes and piling the gym full of people rather than creating a quality experience that means they can justify the ridiculous price.\n\nDo better Nuffield.",

Obviously I understand that the upper management are trying to pack in as many members in as possible but the outdated machines and lack of free weights makes for a subpar experience at best.\n\nI am lucky enough to be on a friends and family membership which meant that I pay £51 however, I recently got an email stating that my next payment will be £63. The email justifies this by saying we have had investment into the club. This ‘investment’ however, has only included 3 new racks and a couple of kettle bells here and there. Everything else in the gym feels like it is either second hand or still there from the early 2000’s. We were told there would be stair masters by the beginning of December, but nothing.\n\nThe pool area overall feels unclean, almost slimy and the steam room absolutely stinks of mould all of the time. The changing rooms are outdated, like something from a 1990’s leisure club. The showers are vile, slimy and full of hair. The lifeguards are polite and respectful but that is about it.\n\nHaving spoken to many members across the gym, I know that not many are planning on staying. Nuffield Management need to find a way to make this club worth paying the hiked prices otherwise they will forcing the old members out and only staying afloat through no joining fee offers. I will be taking my membership across to another gym as soon as this membership runs out.\n\nI have already sent an email to management about this but they are not bothered about members leaving. I just got an email back basically saying ‘we have actioned this’ and nothing more. They are clearly more bothered about quick fixes and piling the gym full of people rather than creating a quality experience that means they can justify the ridiculous price.\n\nDo better Nuffield.",

I've had memberships at both the old JD Gyms site and new site here. The new site is definitely better than the old. Fantastic varied kit for everyone that can be adjusted at multiple different points to be personalised for the best work.\n\nThis gym is also ACTUALLY 24/7 unlike some gyms which will advertise as such but not be open 24h on Sundays. Staff are very friendly. The gym is busy but never overly busy from what I've seen, I'm never struggling waiting for equipment.\n\nIn regards to some critiques. It would be beneficial if the staffed hours began at 5am instead of 6am to bring it in line with some competitors in the area, meaning the main changing rooms can be open earlier too. Also, since the last site, I've noticed there's less equipment for abdominal exercises now and they no longer have a seated dips machine (bring back please!). The QR code system is also highly flawed and some members have to use codes. Finally, in terms of those with disabilities which may wish to attend, they will likely struggle to park in their designated spaces here. I'm consistently noticing most of not all accessible parking spaces taken by cars with not a single blue badge in sight, meaning the drivers are more than likely not entitled to park there and may be doing so for convenience.\n\nOverall, I absolutely love this gym and very happy I got a membership here!",

The sauna looked clean at the time, but I'd recommend that staff educate their members on sauna hygiene. One guy was sitting in his boxers (which can spread dirt and diseases) and clipping his toenails. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Use a towel (or at least swimming shorts) and don't groom yourself in the sauna, please...\n\nI'm not a member here, but look forward to using the club again next time I'm passing through Preston.",

          "reviewText": "I heard about Swim pro from a friend, as I was looking to hire a private pool for me, my mum, daughter and granddaugher. When I contacted them on WhatsApp and I had a very prompt response. I asked how to pay for the pool\nand the instructions were easy. I needed to set up a bank transfer which is an easy way to pay. This was paid up front before the pool was confirmed. I was impressed that they try to provide an allocated time to use the pool that was convenient for us. Unfortunately you can't park outside the house where the pool is as there are 2 other houses in the Triangle. It woukd be a tight squeeze if people where in and out but that was explained before my visit. My daughtet parked at the other side of the road on the other side of Garstang Rd without any issues. On arrival one of the instructors was moping the floor, cleaning and checking the pool before we went in. They had just had a grouo of children for their swimming lessons. It was totally private to get changed, and there are screens if you want to get undressed behind them. There is somewhere to hang your bags and coats etc.\nThere is a toilet as you go through to the pool which i thought was a bit strange at first but I understand why this was designed like this for the children. There is  separate shower room at the pool side. I personally struggle with getting changed but there were disabled seats that I could sit on to get dressed. You have everything you need. I chose this particular pool because there are steps and a bar to hold onto when you're entering the pool, and that was great for me too due to struggling with my mobility and balance. There are floats and armbands in the box at the side of the pool if you forget them for your child. My daughter and I tried the armbands and thought they didn't work but when I contacted them you need to put 3 armbands on each arm as this is how it works when the small children have their swimming lessons. This is now good to know but hopefully my daughter will not forget my granddaughters life jacket she wears.\n\nIf you are going swimming with another person it is £30 and this is the going rate with most private pools for an hour, which is great. I am happy to pay this. If you have more than 2 people it becomes more expensive and it is £55.00 for an hour but if you have 5 people or more you can split the cost between you and again I say the cost is quite reasonable. The pool is nice and warm and a great size for doing lengths. A perfect place for teaching your young ones to swim but at Swim Pro they offer professional instructors and swimming lessons tailored to your child or you as an adults needs. The website is very informative or you can contact them on WhatsApp where you can look back on the service they provide.\n\nI have only been once to the pool but I would highly recommend it and I definately will be booking again soon. Hopefully as soon as this week!!\n\nJoanne F 😃",

The bathroom had an empty handwash bottle, this should have been restocked. The seating area had clearly not been cleaned with dirt and hair on the floor. We were told we had a 2 hour slot in the pool and with 30 minutes to clear up. It was not clearly communicated, as we were not even sent a basic confirmation email, that part of that time was for the owners to clean up the pool. Rather than having these details written unclearly in fine print, it should have been clearly communicated. Towards the end of our time, of which we still had a few minutes, the assumed owner came barging in shouting in a very rude manner saying \"you need to get out now\", and without our permission started to touch and move our personal belongings, we were all shocked and deeply disappointed by the level of rudeness and unprofessionalism. Despite being told that there was someone in the bathroom, she tried barging in twice into the bathroom without knocking whilst i was changing, which made me feel very uncomfortable. When we tried to speak to her to ask about the leaving time, we were rudely and repeatedly spoken over. A very disappointing end which ruined the entire experience, which was for a special birthday. Unfortunately, we will definitely  not be coming here again. Basic manners go a long way especially with customers, hugely disappointing.",

We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

Architecturally beautiful and lovingly restored with incredible attention to detail from the pool side cubicle changing curtains to the tasteful period furniture in the upper floors . The members and staff , friendly and charming shared their special place with us and we very much appreciated . Pool , steam , sauna and jacuzzi left us refreshed and ready for breakfast. Changing rooms and shower  areas were super clean and tidy . Then to breakfast well !!! This was another level and unexpected , ibérico chop with Catalan beans duck egg , morcilla and membrillo was a Hispanic combination I would have only expected to find in heaven , congratulations to the genius who pulled that baby to the pass at menu development . As in many cases sadly wonderful food not matched by service , would you like some toast with that or anything else we can get you would have been nice and a simple upsell , regardless come to expect these things and move on albeit annoying.

Plenty of space to swim-lovely and warm once we got in but could have been a little warmer for us.. Great to have the showers on site and change facilities if required too. We had a lovely coffee from the on site catering van -highly recommend..\nWe returned today to try the restaurant and were not disappointed. We had really lovely meals. I can recommend the house salad ,it was not just a pile of lettuce leaves with the usual chunks of tomato and cucumber but a delectable plate of finely mixed ingredients and gorgeous dressing -well worth the price and even  though the restaurant was busy over the lunch time and had a 'kitchen crisis' it still felt very relaxing. The staff are amazing and seemed to be really enjoying their job... There is lots more to try and we have already made a booking for a family birthday celebration.\nWe will be back very soon Saltdean Lido as there is more to explore...",

Booked tickets in advance and the price is reasonable (especially compared to Sea Lanes). Free parking on site.\nNot sure if the current changing area is temporary? These seemed fairly rudimentary and relatively few changing cubicles. Lockers available, although you'll need somewhere to store the locker key! Showers lovely and warm.\nDeco cafe looked lovely, but was already full when we visited - obviously a popular spot!\nWould return again when restoration fully completed. Definitely one not to miss!",

There were many like us hoping to have a proper swim, but there was only one very small section of the pool separated off for this (equivalent to a lane). The area for diving was bigger. This was a shame as the pool was starting to empty out but there were still a number of children in the areas that were deep enough to swim. It is a lovely setting and the pool was very refreshing, it is unheated. There are grassy areas where you can sit if you are planning to be there for a few hours. It is definitely aimed at families. It would be nice if Bradford Council set aside the last hour of opening for adult lane swims. The changing rooms are in serious need of a revamp - 3 showers, 2 sinks, 6 cubicles, dirty and wet everywhere. For £11.95 a swim, they should be much better than they are. Bizarrely we were asked twice to be quiet as there was a soundbath going on in the next room - this at the end of the evening when lots of people were showering (or queuing to shower!) and changing.",

          "reviewText": "A Perfect Day at Woburn Lido\n\nFrom the moment I arrived at Woburn Lido, I knew I was in for a treat. Nestled in the charming village of Woburn, this historic outdoor pool is a hidden gem that offers a delightful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the stunning Art Deco architecture. The beautifully restored changing rooms, with their vibrant tiles and classic arches, transported me back to the 1930s. It was like stepping into a different era, and I couldn’t help but admire the attention to detail that has gone into preserving this piece of history.\n\nAs I dipped my toes into the crystal-clear water, I was pleasantly surprised by the perfect temperature. The pool is heated to a comfortable 26°C, making it ideal for a leisurely swim or a more vigorous workout. The separate paddling pool for children is a thoughtful touch, ensuring that families can enjoy their time here without any worries.\n\nThe atmosphere at Woburn Lido is incredibly relaxing. Surrounded by lush greenery, the pool area feels like a tranquil oasis. I spent hours lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun, and taking refreshing dips whenever I felt like it. The friendly staff were always on hand, making sure everything was just right.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the sense of community. Locals and visitors alike come together here, creating a warm and welcoming environment. I had some lovely conversations with fellow swimmers, sharing stories and tips about the best spots in the area.\n\nAfter a day of swimming and relaxation, I treated myself to a delicious snack from the on-site kiosk. The selection of refreshments was impressive, and I enjoyed a tasty ice cream while basking in the late afternoon sun.\n\nAs the day came to an end, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for this wonderful experience. Woburn Lido is more than just a swimming pool; it’s a place where memories are made. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful retreat or a fun day out with family and friends, Woburn Lido is the perfect destination.",

There's also a cafe on site for hot and cold drinks, snacks and ice creams.\nLovely pool, lovely staff, will be back regularly ☺️☺️",

In the summer I find it’s better to book a week in advance. Right now it’s limited to 10 swimmers at a time, which tbh is about the max number I’d want for lane swimming anyway. There’s a slow lane and a fast lane, and there are not usually any issues with people being in the wrong place.\n\nThe changing rooms are clean though small. The cafe is good for a quick hot drink to warm up afterwards & is reasonably priced. Lifeguards are welcoming and encouraging. The car park is tiny, but there are hundreds of spaces across the road, which is clearly signposted. Everyone I’ve encountered has been very friendly and at the right time you can spot elephants over at Woburn Safari Park!",

The location is beautiful but the apartment itself was a little run down the cleanliness itself wasn’t too great. There was a musty smell in the hallway which I felt I had to apologise for to my bridesmaids and family who were helping me get ready on the day. the stairs are uneven which was a massive problem trying to get down all 5 flights of them in a wedding dress as there is no lift in the building. The fridge in the apartment smelled of gone off milk considering we was booked for 2 nights there was only 2 very small bottles of water and enough coffee sachets for a coffee each in the morning for one day. The tv had no signal in the lounge area the bath took 45 minutes to fill so as lovely as it was it was a pointless task. The shower was worse a very small shower couldn’t move in it. The sink in the bathroom was blocked. The heating came on automatically which is ok for winter months but not in summer we would have turned it off but the thermostat was broken the toaster was dirty and full of crumbs to someone who is gluten free with an autoimmune disorder I couldn’t even make a slice of toast without the risk of being ill so couldn’t even eat the morning of my wedding very very disappointing stay and definitely wasn’t worth the money paid. I will not recommend or return",

The shared living space has large windows and plenty of seating. The shared kitchen was spacious and tidy. The host, Waseem, provides tea, coffee, milk, sugar, and breakfast cereal. They provided me with fresh bed linens and towels, whenever I needed them. I had my own personal hygiene products, but they did provide hand soap, shampoo, and body wash if needed. I was always greeted with a warm smile and a captivating conversation. I wish I had taken more pictures of the place. I truly hope to go back there again soon. What a wonderful place to stay!",

Well kept gardens and grass between each pitch are pleasant.  The site is bigger than it appears on entry as there are roughly 3  areas of around  10 pitches positioned so that you can't see other campers.  I believe that every pitch has electric hookup. Surrounded by fields and a wood and located a 15 to 20 minute walk downhill into Ribchester.\nIn Ribchester there is a Spar store, the  river, a beautiful church and a fabulous museum explaining about Roman times. There is the remains of a granary and roman baths within the town and clear notice boards giving information  about them. £4 museum entry open 12 till 4 ( longer hours I summer). There is also a very friendly pub, the White Bull, that does food and had a roaring fire.\nSo plenty to do in the area, pleasant woodland walks directly from the site.  Clean toilets,  super washing up area, even an area to wash your dog or bike. Good value, great location.  I'll definitely be returning.",

There is a toilet/shower block and a lovley cafe next door, open Thurs, Fri, Sat. It's tranquil and quiet,  but you are in easy travel to the shops for provisions. Its dog friendly and decent spaces between the 6 pitches . We stayed at a club site recently for a similar amount per night , it was shocking and I've told them so. This beats it hands down and we will be back, I stayed with my partner Sue, 2 dogs and visiting 3 other adults all who stayed at various points. Well worth it, the weather was great and the site even more.\nSusan Parker , Gary Etchells MBE & family",

There is no check out time, just be courteous and leave before the night starts. We met the owners presumably children or grandchildren, 2 boys who my son was absolutely taken with.

The site is a swamp!! Make sure you wear thigh high wellies. Pay an extra £3 a night for your awning to be up whether it sinks or comes unstuck from the swamp of ground they don’t care. You won’t get no help from the owners once you have paid. Oh and to shower? 50p per shower for 7 mins then cuts off. No laundry facilities. No toilet roll in the loo! Baring in mind you have to share 1 toilet & 1 shower with everyone on site! VERY UNHYGIENIC. You can’t make no noise, no luxury drinking, no vaping, no smoking. All around an awful experience!",

There is no laundry or washing-up facilies\nor even a public payphone, wi-fi no sorry, not even toilet paper in the loo! I did ask the question what exactly do you get for your money, as i thought a more realistic figure would have been approx £50 per week (which incidently is all i paid her but she cut off my electric) overall if you want peace and quiet and don't mind paying o over the odds for not alot in return then go for it......",

Includes one field designated for ball play, but otherwise no child play area (not a problem for us).\nShort walk from a pub / restaurant (Grapes) which was nice and a 10 minute drive from town with good shops and takeaways.\nGood for travelling to Blackpool (approx. 30 minutes drive). We used it to travel into Blackpool most days.\nWe were not told at booking about the arrival time (2pm or later). I think the owner forgot to mention on confirmation; we arrived early, she was accommodating just asking to finish her lunch first but instead we went to buy our own lunch and then went back at 2pm.\nI recommend this site.",

The dog walking field is well kept and the gates make it feel secure.  Pitches are hard standing ones and electric and water is close to the pitches, we never had any issues with them.  We took our son who loved the freedom to bike around the site, we felt relaxed knowing the main gate is locked and he couldn't go anywhere other than on the site.  We didn't use the showers but the toilet was clean and tidy and Mrs. Johnson is always about making sure everything is OK.  We will be returning as the site is relaxing and a world away from daily life.  Highly recommended",

Linda drove around a couple of times which I felt was good that she kept an eye on things. Dog walking field was good and gated off. A little inconvenient unlocking and opening the entry/exit gate each time but added benefit of safety there. Only the disabled toilet and shower room available for 30 caravans so a little inconvenient. However once the one ladies and one gents is opened this will be better. Chemical waste point was a plastic bin lid over a sewer drain so could cause splash back if you weren’t careful. Could do with better some cleaning agent left there. A nice stay and would definitely go back.",

Linda was a great hostess. As it was out first time, she checked to make sure all was OK and set us off on our way home. Only 2 toilets open but this was no issue and never had to queue. 50p to use the shower but get ample time (5 minutes or so) and the showers are very powerful (not great for sunburn), absolutely loved it and will be booking again for the summer. Thanks Linda - beautiful site with some lovely caravanners.",
