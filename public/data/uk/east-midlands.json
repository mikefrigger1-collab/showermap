My son has done Stage 1 three times and Stage 2 three times as well. This wasn’t necessarily due to his progress, but more because of frequent changes – either the swimming teacher changed, or we had to switch the day or time. As a result, it felt like we weren’t moving forward as we should have.\n\nThat said, the swimming coaches themselves are excellent. They’re dedicated, friendly, and genuinely try their best to work with each child. It’s just a shame that the inconsistency in the structure or scheduling of the lessons can impact a child’s progress.\n\nOverall, it’s still a very good centre with plenty to offer.

It set her back months and I only realised how bad this place was when I eventually left and went to a local swimming centre with instructors who are actually in the water with them instead of standing outside the pool singing nursery ryhmes.\n\nThe experience in rushcliffe set my daughter back months!

Usually use Harvey Hadden, Ken Martin or Victoria baths, but the only swimming session listed as available and not fully booked was Clifton so I thought we would give it a go as it said swimming session with flume. The swimming pool was however closed and only the \"Leisure pool\" was open with the flume which is the baby pool for lack of a better description. You can imagine my teens face when she realised! This should be clearer when booking as no Adult or over 8 year old can swim here. We made the best of it though which is the only reason for the 3 stars.\n\nThe staff I'm sorry to say are miserable as sin.\nSaw at least 5 staff members not one smiling or welcoming.\nVery odd atmosphere where they almost make you feel unwelcome due to how miserable they are.\nBeing the Mum of a competitive swimmer I'm very regularly at Noytinghams Leisure centres and this is worlds apart from the atmosphere and staff at other centres. Not a happy work force or welcoming environment to say the least.\n\nI dobt like leavibg bad reviews but this place warranted it. I wouldn't recommend or visit again.",

Usually use Harvey Hadden, Ken Martin or Victoria baths, but the only swimming session listed as available and not fully booked was Clifton so I thought we would give it a go as it said swimming session with flume. The swimming pool was however closed and only the \"Leisure pool\" was open with the flume which is the baby pool for lack of a better description. You can imagine my teens face when she realised! This should be clearer when booking as no Adult or over 8 year old can swim here. We made the best of it though which is the only reason for the 3 stars.\n\nThe staff I'm sorry to say are miserable as sin.\nSaw at least 5 staff members not one smiling or welcoming.\nVery odd atmosphere where they almost make you feel unwelcome due to how miserable they are.\nBeing the Mum of a competitive swimmer I'm very regularly at Noytinghams Leisure centres and this is worlds apart from the atmosphere and staff at other centres. Not a happy work force or welcoming environment to say the least.\n\nI dobt like leavibg bad reviews but this place warranted it. I wouldn't recommend or visit again.",

The staff and facilities are second to none, however there are some issues, if improved could make it even better!\nSwimming - only one lane that caters for the doggie paddler all the way up to Michael Phelps, which is extremely frustrating for all. I have stopped going as toes and arms are going everywhere and makes a decent swim a challenge due to start/ stop a lot of the time. The gym is where I really do believe there is an accident waiting to happen. Although you have gym etiquette signs displayed throughout the gym it is blatantly obvious that these are completely ignored by many. Some members think that when they are in there, it's their gym.  I've seen members walking around the gym with no trainers (constantly), wearing training bottoms that are that long, it's beyond belief how they have not fallen over and hurt their self ( there is a lot of nasty equipment in there to inadvertently headbutt). My favourite is where you see someone on a running machine, they then leave it going at a good old speed, then go on to another bit of equipment, to then hop back on the running machine whilst it's in mid flow ( i shudder to think what would happen if someone didn't realise it was going and tried to hop on). Another good one I've seen is someone using the step machine whilst using weights (thats and accident waiting to happen). Last point is the younger members, some must be 16 at best. I see some of them training, and it makes me look away, as some of them are trying to lift weights that must be nearly touching their body weight. I asked one of the staff the other day if it was OK to leave your kit over the floor for someone to potentially fall over (which will happen), and he didn't know? If a member of staff us manning the desk in the gym surely he needs the information on what he should be monitoring? , gym rules? Etc..\nI'm not usually one for moaning about a gym, I like to turn up, get my training done, and get home. That said, I do believe in gym etiquette, respect for others using the facilities,\nand most importantly Health and safety. There is a big accident waiting to happen if some matters are not addressed soonest.",

I want to start by highlighting the fantastic instructors — Paul, Norah, Martin, and Noah on the kids' swimming side — who are all incredibly professional, patient, and engaging. Their dedication really makes a difference in the learning experience.\n\nHowever, I do feel the facilities leave much to be desired. The state of the female changing rooms is frankly appalling and not up to the standard one would expect from a centre of this size and reputation. It’s disappointing to see such neglect in an area that’s essential for comfort and hygiene.\n\nAdditionally, the new policy around class cancellations feels far too rigid, especially considering how frequently classes are overcrowded. Flexibility is important for members who are trying to balance busy schedules, and this policy doesn’t reflect that.\n\nLastly, while staff interactions in person have generally been fine, my experience over the phone has been frustrating. I called twice this week with queries and felt fobbed off both times. It’s not the level of service I’d expect, and it’s something that definitely needs improvement.",

I enjoy swimming some mornings its a battle to swim as it can get really busy tho. Now for a few negatives ….. so having booked for hip hop step this week, having confirmation on the app and reminding me i must cancel 2 hours before if i can not make it . I am informed by my class mates that group is cancelled do i get a call or a notification? No which is poor service. Then to tonight and water aerobics now with Lorraine being away ive not been to any classes as when I did book one it got cancelled on the morning so I gave it a go this evening and we get in the pool after five past and I told that the instructor is coming turns out the instructor is double booked and the class is taken by Tyler , now Tyler was absolutely fantastic. He improvise last minute and with the music Tyler was an absolute saviour to the day and kind of restored my faith in the place a little bit but it is still poor for that instructors to double book or customers to not be informed when classes are cancelled I understand things can happen at the last minute but the reason for this class being cancelled yesterday was not a last-minute thing, and no effort was made to tell us. So to recap the Positive stuff most of the staff friendly , Lorraine is Awesome and Tyler is a awesome !",

I couldn’t believe how he managed to get a very anxious little girl from swimming to get all that confident to swim unaided on the same session, she had another session the following week and swam again on her back unaided. He’s attentive and gives every child their focused time. My daughter was struggling with her goggles he even picked up on that and took them off and gave them a wipe and carried on. After her first session he came over to have a chat and gave lara the biggest words of encouragement for learning how to swim so quick. She came back home and would not stop talking about her achievements and couldn’t wait to come back. I would honestly recommend this swimming center for any parents, no frills, you’re in and out quickly, they learn so much in a short space of time, i hope this gets passed on to henry, he deserves some sort of recognition for being an incredible teacher, i’ve seen swim coaches in the past whilst i’ve been swimming myself and yet to see someone with that level of attentiveness, assertiveness that children need to focus on their swimming and encouragement they need to thrive in. Thank you for teaching my daughter how to swim on her back in the shortest time and getting her our of her shell!",

I visit the gym first thing in the mornings too and the showers are filthy (grime, bits of fluff and body hair clearly not washed away).\nWhile some of the new equipment is good, some has not been properly designed so for example, some pulleys often render other equipment useless.

This was Saturday day time.\n\nSuppose Wilford/Compton Acres is a nicer area…\n\nReally wish they had 7kW EV charging on site (Aldi’s over the road don’t count/work and BP Pulse are too fast) to top up while working out.\n\nAnd if their SM guys read this. Put an individual QR on each piece of equipment, that you can scan on the PureGym app to learn how to use or report broken. Will mean quicker reports (verified by staff on site) and visibility as to how long it takes to fix.\n\nNo one thinks machines won’t break, but seeing you fix them quickly is the key.\n\nThink that’ll do.",

So glad I took the plunge. It has been one of the best things I have done in recent years. Having managed one winter in my swimming costume, getting in the water with ice on top, I really feel like I am capable of so much more in all aspects of my life.

I was warmly welcomed by the owner and local swimmers, and everything is really well organised — clear buoyed course, canoeists on the water, and a lifeguard keeping watch. The lake (or pond, but it feels like a lake!) was a lovely 19 degrees, much warmer than my usual Irish Sea swims, and it was amazing to be surrounded by nature and even dragonflies while swimming.\n\nGreat atmosphere, very safe, and even a super cute dog to greet you.

And they know they will be stuck doing that for the rest of the days that week. In the afternoon they did swimming which consisted of one length following by a free for all of kids and floats, very little structure and no chance to really swim as pool was so full. In between they did indoor games which seemed ok, but the whole thing is made worse by them being able to see the kids who are there all week rock climbing, bike riding, scootering, skate boarding  and all sorts outside while they seem to be killing time or doing stuff they didn't choose. The website and brochure is full of pics of great activities and the kids were really looking forward to it. we mentioned it to the staff onsite who said, \"yes we know it isn't great and we've fed this back before to the marketing staff because we think its misleading and it shouldn't be advertised in this way\"",

Buses to the northern side of Nottingham, City Hospital or towards Mansfield can be found within a 2 to 5 minute walk.\nAcross the road is Lidl, and many restaurants are nearby or further up Mansfield Road. There is a laundrette across the road.\nBad location if you want somewhere very quiet as it is a built up area, but it's not the noisiest city area.\n\nRoom: There are rooms of different sizes. Room 2 is a very small room, with a single-sized bed. There is enough space to get changed. The floor space may be around 2 metres by 1.5m at the foot of the bed and 30cm wide next to the bed (the other side of the bed against the wall). The ceiling is high, so even a person well over 6ft would be ok. The bed would be ok for someone a few inches over 6ft.\n\nThe two pillows were firm, which was good. The bed is firm which is good, however the mattress was indented in in the middle.\nI did not have bed bugs. I did get stung by a wasp, but I brought that in.\n\nIt has plug sockets and surpringingly two USB wall sockets, which was a good addition.\nThe dark curtains well-covered the window. The window can be opened and closed. The room was dark at night with the lights off. The lighting was bright, with multiple small lights in the ceiling.\nThe carpet seemed clean. It is spongey to walk on, which is unusual.\n\nThe room was a comfortable temperature - I never felt cold and could wear just a t-shirt/trousers/socks, despite 10-15C weather outside.\n\nThe en-suite bathroom is an ok size and layout - small, with the toilet and sink on the right, shower on the left. The sink is very small and has separate cold and hot taps. The shower was electric and adequate. There is shower gel in a holder in the shower and at the sink, plus body lotion near the sink.\nThe bathroom door handle doesn't work, but it doesn't need to because the latch thing is a circular roller so it opens by pushing or pulling the door without the need of pushing the handle down.\n\nThe room can be noisy as it's at the top of the stairs so you may hear it when people go up them or when they close the door at the top of the stairs. When people walk in the corridor it's like a mini earthquake. You can also hear people if they talk at the top of the stairs. The cleaning cupboard is outside, so it can be noisy when cleaning is happening.\n\nMisc items: in the room/bathroom there was tea, instant coffee, milk pods, a small mug, a small glass, a kettle, two wooden hangers and a hanging rail, a small-medium wall-mounted TV, TV remote, bath towel, shower gel at the sink, shower gel in the shower, body lotion near the sink. The TV was not tuned well, but I retuned it and then it was fine from BBC1 to the higher channels (not that I watch TV). I never used the kettle.\nThe door uses a mechanical key, on a wooden keychain.\nThere's no desk but the windowsill is big enough to write some notes on if you knelt on the bed. There's a very small wall-attached table in the corner by the bed (A5-sized), a chest of three drawers below the TV (upon which is the tea etc, but you can put a few small items here).\n\nService: didn't bother me and friendly enough. I left my phone charger plug in the room and called about it and eas told to contact the next day. I went the next day and they gave me the plug.\n\nSome people did laughing gas here. I heard the staff saying it. I guess you find some sleazy guests here.",

The sink is very small and has separate cold and hot taps. The shower was electric and adequate. There is shower gel in a holder in the shower and at the sink, plus body lotion near the sink.\nThe bathroom door handle doesn't work, but it doesn't need to because the latch thing is a circular roller so it opens by pushing or pulling the door without the need of pushing the handle down.\n\nThe room can be noisy as it's at the top of the stairs so you may hear it when people go up them or when they close the door at the top of the stairs. When people walk in the corridor it's like a mini earthquake. You can also hear people if they talk at the top of the stairs. The cleaning cupboard is outside, so it can be noisy when cleaning is happening.\n\nMisc items: in the room/bathroom there was tea, instant coffee, milk pods, a small mug, a small glass, a kettle, two wooden hangers and a hanging rail, a small-medium wall-mounted TV, TV remote, bath towel, shower gel at the sink, shower gel in the shower, body lotion near the sink. The TV was not tuned well, but I retuned it and then it was fine from BBC1 to the higher channels (not that I watch TV). I never used the kettle.\nThe door uses a mechanical key, on a wooden keychain.\nThere's no desk but the windowsill is big enough to write some notes on if you knelt on the bed. There's a very small wall-attached table in the corner by the bed (A5-sized), a chest of three drawers below the TV (upon which is the tea etc, but you can put a few small items here).\n\nService: didn't bother me and friendly enough. I left my phone charger plug in the room and called about it and eas told to contact the next day. I went the next day and they gave me the plug.\n\nSome people did laughing gas here. I heard the staff saying it. I guess you find some sleazy guests here.",

Same note also stated check out was at 10:30, it’s 10am.\n\nJust a lot of stuff needs updating and sorting.\n\nI think for £35 and for a night or 2 isn’t unreasonable.

They had cancelled a booking due to a card blocking that day (due to a too much contactless swiping  - but I was at a business conference)\n\nWith great kindness, the owner honored my booking, was hugely helpful and swiftly checked me into a pleasant, airy shared room. I got a quick and helpful tour and a soul-reviving shower, after a quick brief of the sensible house rules and a few local quirks (a nearby pub empties its glass bins late at night - nothing too onerous). He also mentioned a few disappointing occasions when he had been unable to help people 'auto-messed up' by online booking systems.\n\nThe kitchen and lounge are very pleasant and bright, and the beds are good.

The staff on reception are so friendly and helpful- around 24/7, and follow up issues quickly. The social spaces are modern and a great space to work in. They put on events fairly regularly, but maybe not quite as often as other student roost buildings- more events/activities would’ve been good. My room was a great space- (I had a silver studio), and it was big and modern (gray carpets and gray walls, unlike the photos that look much more run down) but am aware not all rooms are updated yet. I was on the 1st floor and expected lots of noise, but the windows block out most of the noise and it’s actually really quiet at night! Shower, heating and hot water works perfectly, unlike what some of the reviews say. Location is fantastic, bus service, tram service and NTU city campus all within 5 min walk- and right in central city centre. Overall, really loved my time at Hydrogen!",

Wonderfully quiet from 21st century noise, just beautiful bird song.\nThe only “improvement?” I would ask would be some means of getting a decent WiFi signal for when the weather isn’t good. Site is ideal for caravans as you need some transport to get around. Apparently the village is an “easy bike ride” away, but for us two geriatric motorhome dwellers this wasn’t an option.😏 In the sunnier months of the year we’d definitely return.",

Our Sherwood Forest chalet was more spacious and had 2 rooms, so could definitely accommodate kids or another couple - we stayed in Harmony 29.\nAfter reading mixed reviews, we weren't sure what to expect but our September stay was fab! We were allowed to check in a little earlier than 4pm, and the both staff members when we checked in and out were lovely.\nThe grounds were quiet due to the time of year, however it was perfect for a couple who were after a quiet break. The chalet was clean and warm, the bedding was clean and comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed for a 2 night stay.\nAt first we weren't sure about the placement of the hot tub as it was more exposed than our one we had in Norfolk, and was on the side of the chalet in view of a small road that led to the last few chalets - however our tub was more set back than others next to us and there was a short wooden fence, so you got used to it!\nThere were always staff onsite so I got the impression that they are quite on top of maintenance. Somebody popped by daily to check on the hot tub so I feel like any issues would have been resolved.\nThe location was great for visiting Nottingham and Rufford Abbey and there was enough to do for a mini break.\nThe surrounding woodland provided a nice walk and a few chickens, and there was a swimming pool onsite too.\nIf you're after a less intense Centre Parcs stay at a much cheaper cost I would recommend Sherwood Castle. We would definitely return.",

The secret room looked exactly as in the pictures very romantic but had a few issues, tv didn't work with remote as it had gotton damp so rang reception and maintenence came within 20 mins to sort it great size tv 65\" but you do have to jump on your own hotspot to watch anything,there is no heaters in the secret room which let's it down as it got really cold once you was out the hottub,the table and bar area were great the bar area had a fridge big enough for lots of drinks,we played a few card games at the table but the huge tree stump coming into the room made the roof squeek,the day bed was so cold and damp from the condensation you couldn't lay on to get warm,the hottub was the best bit of the room was huge and set to a lovely temperature with lights and bubbles,however it wasn't working on first morning so again had to phone reception which didnt open till 9am we was up early and wait for a member from the leisure team to come sort which took about 40 mins,a few tweeks and this could have been perfect but we're happy we had a break away and made the most of the bits that were great 👍",

It was obvious it hadn’t been cleaned at all — filthy appliances, a mouldy, rusty microwave, and ripped flooring with carpet covered in hair. Completely unacceptable.\nAfter complaining, we were moved to another lodge, but it honestly wasn’t much better. Two of the beds were snapped, the sofa legs were broken, and the TV didn’t work. Basic maintenance has clearly been ignored throughout the site.\nThe facilities were just as bad. The swimming pool looked unappealing, with paint visibly flaking off into the water. The sports hall was even worse — half the lights didn’t work, and there wasn’t even enough equipment available to use it properly.\nThis place is advertised as “luxury,” which is laughable.

The facilities are good for the most part, with good machines but a cramped free weights section where people often get in each other's way.\n\nThe showers are clean, both for the pool and in the changing room.\n\nThe staff range from friendly with a good sense of humour to miserable and cold. I don't expect them to have smiles on their faces all the time but one or two members seem like they want to be anywhere else.\n\nAnother downside is that they are shut on bank holidays, which is pretty poor compared to other gyms I've been to; have reduced hours, sure, but to be closed entirely? The swimming hours also leave very little options for anyone working full time. Most gyms with pools I've been to have allowed people in as late as 8 or 9pm, but here? The last swimming session you can book is as early as 5 or 6 on many evenings. Very restrictive and if they don't extend the hours then I'm not sure I'll renew my membership in a few months' time.",

The facilities are good for the most part, with good machines but a cramped free weights section where people often get in each other's way.\n\nThe showers are clean, both for the pool and in the changing room.\n\nThe staff range from friendly with a good sense of humour to miserable and cold. I don't expect them to have smiles on their faces all the time but one or two members seem like they want to be anywhere else.\n\nAnother downside is that they are shut on bank holidays, which is pretty poor compared to other gyms I've been to; have reduced hours, sure, but to be closed entirely? The swimming hours also leave very little options for anyone working full time. Most gyms with pools I've been to have allowed people in as late as 8 or 9pm, but here? The last swimming session you can book is as early as 5 or 6 on many evenings. Very restrictive and if they don't extend the hours then I'm not sure I'll renew my membership in a few months' time.",

When I started there were actual staff who helped people train and made sure that the public were safe but now the only time male staff members enter the area is if there is a young woman training that they can ‘chat’ with. People train in their outdoor coats and shoes. Personal hygiene is often an issue. There is no gym etiquette - people sit chatting on equipment for literally ages or play on their phones. . The music played is non inclusive - rap music and continuous Radio 1 Xtra drivel when the clientele are often mostly well into their 50s. Now I’m a pensioner and I still pay a fortune to go 2/3 times a week -  I wonder why I don’t go somewhere else - but I’m trapped by convenience and the lure of Tesco.

I’ve often seen my child not swim more than a couple of times during a half hour session because they are so busy. The changing rooms are filthy, the showers are all cold except 1. I don’t know how they get away with it in all honesty. I should have cancelled a long time ago. On the other hand, the gym is nice and the soft play is good for kids. But my review is based on the almost £11 per 30 mins swimming lesson, which, in real terms, is about 5-8 mins of actual swimming.",

I have a 2 and a 6 year old and they were loving it, climbing walls not that we got to that or had time but find yome they're walls are worth it they are very high and all of them are at different levels of difficulty so gives a good challenge! They have vending machines in the playworld and they're is a cafe that the gym open's so you are able to bring things through. I personally think they're was enough tables and chairs they also had lockers for parents or sibling that really want to get involved, but I do believe if it was really busy we would struggle with seating but as i said it's very spacious lots of places to lean. Gave it a 4 star as to find out alot of the information I had to gi they're or ring as they're was no clear pricing I thought they're was but only if you had an active fitness card. I didnt and paid 14. 52 for 2 children and tbh I thought that was brilliant as not on a school day!",

The area around the pool is even worse all dirt in the grout looks like it needs jet washing I make my daughter wear crocs. Also charge you 10 extra if god forbid the dd doesn’t go through they won’t try to take the money just charge you £10 which is disgusting as a single parent in a cost of living crisis. The swimming instructors are great but the rest of the staff are rude and have no compassion. They need to invest in a cleaner. Maybe people wouldn’t mind paying the extra 10. £35 swimming lessons for my child this month right before Christmas and the woman didn’t care at all. As a single parent it’s disgusting",

That’s it.\nThe spa section and changing rooms are still in a terrible state—dirty and far from what you’d expect from a so-called “premium” club. Dirt is everywhere, all the time. The showers are full of mold, which is extremely harmful to health, and nobody seems to care or do anything about it.\nThe pool is filthy, and the temperature is inconsistent. Whenever it’s family time and you bring your little one, the water is freezing cold—this has been the case for at least five years. It almost feels intentional. The jacuzzi and kids’ pool have parts missing, leaving sharp edges exposed—how is this even compliant with health and safety standards?\nI’ve complained multiple times through the app—no response. On Wednesday, I even left a message at reception with a lady (curly hair) who took all my details and promised the manager would call me Friday. Today is Friday—still nothing. I submitted another complaint through the app requesting a callback—again, nothing.\nAnd yet, they have the audacity to email me saying membership fees will increase from January, which I clearly stated I do not agree with.\nDavid Lloyd might have been a premium gym years ago, but now it’s worse than PureGym. Honestly, Nuffield is ten times better. So think twice before locking yourself into a one-year contract with a company that clearly doesn’t care about its customers—or their safety.",

It certainly feels like Nuffield aren't interested in listening to feedback of members but also provide a premium gym. I guess it's because they know they have a sort of a monopoly in the area as a premium gym. Although they are happy to charge like a premium gym.\n\nOverall, this gym is like a pure gym/ gym group but with a swimming pool and gym classes.",

The equipment is very limited — for example, there’s only one bench press bar, so it’s quite possible you come in and can’t even do your main workout because it’s always in use. The membership price is similar to other gyms like PureGym, but PureGym has several times more equipment and you don’t need to wait in line or change your plan.\n\nThey also have strange rules. I usually train with my friend and sometimes we do a video call while working out, just to check each other’s form. Here, you’re not allowed to make a video call at all (even if there’s no one else on your screen). I emailed the university and even they couldn’t explain why, just said it’s the “policy.”\n\nHygiene is another issue. They put wipes to clean the equipment, but honestly, I felt like only me and one other person ever used them. There’s also a sign that says no outdoor shoes in the stretching area, but everyone walks straight in with the same shoes they wear outside — so the mats are actually quite dirty.\n\nThere’s hardly any space for stretching, and the ventilation is really poor. On hot days, it feels like you’re being cooked inside.\n\nOverall, not worth the money compared to other gyms in the city.",

Changing rooms are always dirty and smelly, not enough seating for spectators during lessons , so you cant even watch your child swim with ppl standing up . Not enough showers either. Quality of teaching depends on what teacher you get. We have been lucky to get a very experienced teacher but now the glass sizes are so big the value for money isnt their. We started in 2021 and it was £22 a month and now 31, and its not worth it now.",

We did look online so knew exactly how much entry would be and that it would be no towel day. I was fine with this whilst the other 2 were a little more apprehensive and reserved at first. Unfortunately upon arriving around 19:30 the area for parking was very busy. My partner and friend got out to ask if the no towel was optional (it was not), which was fine for me. When they came out to let me know that having a towel/swimsuit wasn't an option for a today they decided they wanted to give it a shot because it looked nice and the staff member was very friendly and helpful.\n\nWhen we had managed to find a parking spot we all went in and the staff member on the door was very helpful, friendly and informative. He gave us a little tour of the facilities and what to expect.\n\nThey provide you with a large towel, small flannel towel, flip flops and a locker key all for the price of entry (£15). This also allows you to stay all day if you wanted (open -close).\n\nThe facilities are on the darker side compared to your typical type of spa but as a fan of the dark and dingy I felt at home 😅 the facilities could honestly do with some updating in some areas but don't let this deter you as everything was very clean and seeing the staff members very frequently changing bins and cleaning up the different areas was fantastic.\n\nClientele was very mixed in age, size and race which was nice to see. The majority of the clients were exceptionally friendly and said hi or started small talk which was also nice of them, especially as first timers. We never once was made to feel like we were outcasts or unwanted there.\n\nIt's a shame that this was our first visit and not our millionth. We will definitely be visiting again and more frequently possibly weekly (no towel Tuesdays) for me, but the different days and events they hold caters to a wide variety of people, needs and interests.\n\nI would however recommend as a first timer that arriving after 6 on a weekday seems to be a good time as it's not very busy and let's you get used to it before being thrown in the deepend as they say. Multiple people had mentioned it can get rather busy and overcrowded on some days and times.\n\nAll in all a fantastic place for the LGBT+ community in the Leicestershire area and will look forward to many more visits in the very near future.",

At 23m long, 9m high and 2.5m thick, it is one of the largest pieces of Roman masonry still standing in Britain.  Since the medieval period, when it was commonly believed to be part of a Temple to Janus, there has been much discussion about what the Jewry Wall may have been.  It was not until it was excavated in the late 1930s by the pioneering archaeologist Dame Kathleen Kenyon (coincidentally in preparation for the building of a new swimming baths) that its role as part of a substantial bathing complex was demonstrated, and not the town’s forum as previously thought.  Kenyon’s excavations were the first large-scale archaeological investigation of Roman Leicester and paved the way for eighty years of archaeological discoveries",

People regularly leave weights lying around instead of putting them back—expecting someone new or less strong to unload multiple 25 kg plates from a barbell or leg press is unreasonable.\n\nDumbbells are often left scattered on the floor near benches, creating obvious trip hazards. If someone were to fall or injure themselves because of this, it could easily lead to legal action. Safety should be taken seriously. If someone is strong enough to lift the weights to use them, there’s no excuse for not racking them properly afterward.\n\nI also can’t stand how some people have no respect for personal space or hygiene—including groups of students and Uber drivers who seem more interested in staring at women than actually training.\n\nI understand people need to rest between sets, but it’s frustrating when they take 10 minutes just staring at their phones or having long conversations, with no regard for others waiting to use the machine.\n\nOn top of that, some of the equipment is badly in need of maintenance or replacement. For example, one of the calf raise machines feels like the bearings are shot, and the loading pole on the leg press is so angled it looks like the plates could fall off at any moment.\n\nOverall, the entire branch feels neglected and seems to be relying solely on the JD Gyms name to keep attracting members. With so little competition in the area, it feels like there’s no incentive for management to address these issues.",

If someone is strong enough to lift the weights to use them, there’s no excuse for not racking them properly afterward.\n\nI also can’t stand how some people have no respect for personal space or hygiene—including groups of students and Uber drivers who seem more interested in staring at women than actually training.\n\nI understand people need to rest between sets, but it’s frustrating when they take 10 minutes just staring at their phones or having long conversations, with no regard for others waiting to use the machine.\n\nOn top of that, some of the equipment is badly in need of maintenance or replacement. For example, one of the calf raise machines feels like the bearings are shot, and the loading pole on the leg press is so angled it looks like the plates could fall off at any moment.\n\nOverall, the entire branch feels neglected and seems to be relying solely on the JD Gyms name to keep attracting members. With so little competition in the area, it feels like there’s no incentive for management to address these issues.",

Loving the Sauna, it’s honestly the icing on the cake.",

Honestly, give her a pay rise.\n\nThe gym has a good selection of equipment, including seated hamstring curls (which some other gyms weirdly don’t have).\n\nThat said, the hip thrust machines and benches are rubbish . They’ve got about four or five, but they’re all awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe look at what Moorways Gym or Nuffield use the ones with plates on either side and proper padding.\n\nAlso, there’s only one hanging leg raise/dip station for the entire gym, and it’s always in use. Would be great if management added another one (and maybe a few more gymnastic rings too).\n\nThe volume of the music can be hit or miss. Sometimes it’s loud, and if you’re under a speaker it can get really loud. Other times it’s at a decent level (would be great if it stayed that way all the time). Still, it’s miles better than my previous gym in that respect.\n\nPricing is really good, great offers and genuinely affordable memberships. That does mean you occasionally get a group of kids messing about, probably until their pocket money runs out.\n\nOne real gripe though: how can you call yourself 24/7 if the changing rooms close from 12–5am? PureGym manages to stay open and keep their changing rooms accessible, so that’s something to fix if JD wants to live up to the 24/7 claim.\n\nThe parking bays are quite tight, which can be a bit annoying when it’s busy but that’s just me being picky.\n\nOverall, great value for money, clean, and well-equipped just needs a few small improvements to make it a proper 5-star gym.",

My first visit went smoothly, but on my second visit the following week I had a very frustrating experience.\nI arrived just after 6:30 and couldn’t get in—neither my QR code nor my membership number worked. I pressed the help button several times and waited about 35 minutes before I was eventually let in by the manager. She was teaching a class and could clearly see me outside but made no effort to buzz me in. When she finally came over, there was no apology—just the explanation that “5G doesn’t work because of the tin roof” and I should have connected to the WiFi. Because of the delay, I only managed a 12-minute workout before needing to shower and get ready for work.\nOn the way out, I had the exact same issue. Even when connected to WiFi, the system still didn’t work, and I had to ask the manager again to let me out. Again, no apology.\nI’ve since heard that I can buy day passes at other gyms, so for days I want to train with my friend (we’re preparing for Hyrox), I’ll be going to her gym instead. Even though it’s not as well equipped as JD, at least I won’t risk wasting my time stuck outside.\nThe equipment here is very good—that’s the only reason I’ve given 2 stars instead of 1. Customer service, unfortunately, was extremely poor.",

To my disbelief a man came out, I did ask him what he was doing in the only female shower when there were several male showers, he said a showers a shower & 'genders don't matter anymore'. This is disgusting, not only is there one shower for women, but its so easily accessible for anyone. Shower floods and the sink and toilet were an absolute state. Shower doesnt last long so you have to keep pressing it. I'm not going to lie it is probably one of the better showers ive been too however it's still not great. There is plenty of room to park & I like the variety of food outlets. However this experience is bad enough for me to complain about it. Around 1500hrs 17/7/25 I went to shower.",

Toilets and electric showers all plumbed and kept in good working order. The support provided when needed was great. Hot water always available. Popular with families and anglers and locals coming for coffee and pizzas. Pizzas are really good and a welcome treat.  Dishwashing facilities, fridges and freezer and firewood are all available in the communal play and living space provided (as well as charger points) - this would keep you dry during wet weather too. There is no wifi and phone signal on site which is a bonus to help switch off. Comms from Mark were excellent. Would recommend and visit again. Kids really enjoyed it and asked to come back!",

Everyone who came (even those anxious about camping) commented on what a great find it was; most couldn't quite believe how ideal it was!\n\nBecause it's an exclusive use site we were able to spread out and not have to worry about bothering other campers - perfect for a lads weekend away, and good for those who wanted to slope off to bed \"early\", as they could go to the quieter end of the field.\n\nWe had a mix of campers and tents, and everyone was happy.\n\nIt's basic - a couple of portaloos and a cold shower (that only the northerners in the group braved!) - but it's all we needed. There's also a big fire pit which we were able to get some fantastic fires going on, picnic benches, garden chairs and a BBQ.\n\nWe spent most of the weekend drinking and eating in the field, but there's also paintball and excellent go-karting (Stretton Circuit) near by. The pub in the nearby village (Rose & Crown, Tilton on the Hill) is only a 15 minute walk away, and is brilliant.\n\nHighly recommend and, if we ever have the need for a large group of people from all over the country to meet up again, we'll definitely be back!",

Everyone who came (even those anxious about camping) commented on what a great find it was; most couldn't quite believe how ideal it was!\n\nBecause it's an exclusive use site we were able to spread out and not have to worry about bothering other campers - perfect for a lads weekend away, and good for those who wanted to slope off to bed \"early\", as they could go to the quieter end of the field.\n\nWe had a mix of campers and tents, and everyone was happy.\n\nIt's basic - a couple of portaloos and a cold shower (that only the northerners in the group braved!) - but it's all we needed. There's also a big fire pit which we were able to get some fantastic fires going on, picnic benches, garden chairs and a BBQ.\n\nWe spent most of the weekend drinking and eating in the field, but there's also paintball and excellent go-karting (Stretton Circuit) near by. The pub in the nearby village (Rose & Crown, Tilton on the Hill) is only a 15 minute walk away, and is brilliant.\n\nHighly recommend and, if we ever have the need for a large group of people from all over the country to meet up again, we'll definitely be back!",

There are space for around 20+ tents and loads of room to park cars.\nThe amenities are basic with a communal tap for drinking water and a cold shower, for the ones who need to \"cool down\", if you know what I mean. A chem loo is provided and professionally cleaned on a weekly basis.\nThe 2 massive pub style benches can easily seat 10 people on each which is handy, come dinner and breakfast time.\nThere is enough room to kick a rugby ball around and it has been known to see bottle rockets flying around to entertain the kids.\nDusk brings out the wildlife, that is, if you are quiet enough and the pheasants and rabbits don't notice any movement, also lookout for the muntjac's and predatory birds, plenty around.\nBring your own fire wood! There is a dedicated area to make a decent size bonfire and enough room for all to sit round.\nYour location allows for spectacular views of the night sky, and on a clear night the sky is packed with stars due to the distance from the nearest city and on 2 occasions we have spotted the space station going by.\nThe owner is an \"old\" rugby player and very much down to earth, so bookings and payments are quickly dealt with, without any hidden catches.\nTake what you need and don’t forget to clean up after yourself to preserve the unspoiled beauty of our countryside.\nI would thoroughly recommend Emily's cut for a relaxing, no fuzz weekend or a few days more!",

We were sheltered from the very hot sun and also the wind. The fire pits are a great touch, we love a camp fire. The kids had a blast hunting for beasts in the woods and making friends with other campers kids. I didn't use the showers at the pub, but those that did said how nice they were. The toilets were clean and the staff welcoming. We didn't see any other campers unless we went to the public areas, it was bliss. Will be returning next summer when we've picked a date.",

This campsite was so easy to find. Andy was very friendly and helpful. Me and my family of 9 shared two pitches at a great price so much space for all 5 of our tents. There was lots to keep us all entertained the box full of sports equipment was a good idea. We all enjoyed a brilliant game of disc golf at a very good price. Lots of space to walk around and explore in the forest campsite we didn't even get to see it all. Great that there's a pub straight across the road with showers for campers to use. Thanks for a lovely memorable camping trip would definitely visit again",

Given this is high season the site was quiet, relaxed and the pitch spacious.\nThe owners were both helpful and friendly. The loo’s and showers, although limited (2 only) were clean and mostly tidy. The pitches varied, some flat and some sloping. The farm shop and restaurant opposite was a great addition. We enjoyed Sunday lunch there and it was excellent value.\nOn the downside the charge of £8.00 for electric hook up per day seemed exorbitant. I  say that because the last site we stayed at had electric meters where you paid for exactly the amount of electricity used. This cost us £2.80 for two nights.\nOverall we enjoyed our time and would definitely stay again.",

It’s a perfect spot for families, especially those with active kids.\n\nThe site is well laid out with spacious electric pitches, and everything is clean and well-maintained. The toilets and showers were spotless throughout our stay, which made the experience even more comfortable.\n\nOne of the best features for families is the range of activities for children. There are proper football goals set up in a large open area, which kept the kids entertained for hours. There’s also a fun and safe bike track where they could ride freely. For the adults (and keen little anglers), the fishing lakes were a peaceful and scenic bonus.\n\nThe owners were incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. They clearly take pride in the site and go out of their way to ensure guests have a great stay.\n\nA lovely surprise was the breakfast wagon onsite – perfect for a lazy morning with a hot coffee and a bacon roll without having to cook.\n\nOverall, this campsite offers a brilliant mix of relaxation and fun. It’s a great base whether you're diving at Stoney Cove, fishing, or just enjoying the countryside with your family.\n\nRating: 5/5 – Highly recommended for families and outdoor lovers!",

          "reviewText": "We recently stayed at this fantastic campsite just a short drive from the Stoney Stanton diving site, and it exceeded all our expectations. It’s a perfect spot for families, especially those with active kids.\n\nThe site is well laid out with spacious electric pitches, and everything is clean and well-maintained. The toilets and showers were spotless throughout our stay, which made the experience even more comfortable.\n\nOne of the best features for families is the range of activities for children. There are proper football goals set up in a large open area, which kept the kids entertained for hours. There’s also a fun and safe bike track where they could ride freely. For the adults (and keen little anglers), the fishing lakes were a peaceful and scenic bonus.\n\nThe owners were incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. They clearly take pride in the site and go out of their way to ensure guests have a great stay.\n\nA lovely surprise was the breakfast wagon onsite – perfect for a lazy morning with a hot coffee and a bacon roll without having to cook.\n\nOverall, this campsite offers a brilliant mix of relaxation and fun. It’s a great base whether you're diving at Stoney Cove, fishing, or just enjoying the countryside with your family.\n\nRating: 5/5 – Highly recommended for families and outdoor lovers!",

          "reviewText": "An Absolute Gem ! A Perfect Weekend Retreat!\nFortway Farm is hands down one of our favourite weekend getaways. It ticks every box: peaceful, well maintained, and packed with thoughtful touches that set it apart from other sites.\nThe fishing lake is beautifully kept and genuinely tranquil, ideal for unwinding. The spacious green area is a real highlight, complete with football goals and a small pump track that’s perfect for children’s BMXs and e-bikes. Our kids absolutely love it. It’s clear a lot of care has gone into making this a fun, safe, and family-friendly site.\nDog owners will be happy to know it’s fully dog friendly. The team that runs the place are outstanding, warm, welcoming, and always willing to help. Security is excellent too, with a large electronic gate giving added peace of mind.\nAnother bonus! There are two fantastic pubs within walking distance. Stanton Lakes is just a short stroll away and offers a great pub with a lovely atmosphere and a fantastic tapas restaurant. Or, take the scenic dog-friendly walk across the local fields to Stoney Stanton, where you’ll find a brilliant pub with bistro-style food and beautiful views over the lake.\nOn-site catering is also great. A food van often serves up delicious evening meals (we’ve had excellent fish and chips here) and breakfast cobs in the mornings. The wash block is modern, spotless, and clearly maintained to a high standard.\nWhether you’re after a relaxing fishing weekend, a child-friendly adventure spot, or a quiet break with the dog, Fortway Farm really does have it all. We’ll be back again and again.",

The site is quiet but in perfect location on a bus route and has the added bonus of a cafe and restaurant onsite. This is open for a delicious breakfast every morning. The staff are brilliant and nothing is too much trouble. The showers and toilets are spotless and shower pressure is perfect. Would deffo use again and ideal stop off if you’re in the midlands area.",

The facilities are top notch – everything is spotless, modern and really well looked after. The gym itself has a huge variety of equipment, whether you’re into weights, cardio or functional training, and there’s always enough space so you’re not queuing to use machines.\n\nThe classes are brilliant too. There’s such a wide range to choose from – spin, yoga, HIIT, bodypump – and the instructors are genuinely motivating and friendly, they make you want to push yourself but also make it enjoyable.\n\nOne of the big highlights for me is the pool and spa area. The indoor pool is perfect for proper lane swimming, while the outdoor pool feels like a treat in the summer. The sauna, steam room and jacuzzi are a great way to wind down after a workout.\n\nThe staff deserve a special mention – from reception through to the trainers, they’re always welcoming, professional and approachable if you need advice. It gives the place a real community feel rather than just being “a gym”.\n\nIt is on the premium side price-wise, but you definitely get what you pay for: a full fitness, wellness and leisure experience all under one roof. If you’re looking for more than just a standard gym in Derby, David Lloyd is well worth it.",

Dylan was very professional and thorough.\n\nI love the range of kids clubs, and the lads that are there are always friendly.\n\nI've had a couple of PT sessions with Izaac, he's very nice and friendly, knowledgeable and professional.\n\nI enjoy using the gym. I have no previous gym experience but it seems well equipped to me.\n\nI enjoy the swimming pools, and they've never been too busy, but be careful where your treading, there's a lot of bird poop and I've seen the same corn plaster every day for the past week.. I heard someone moaning in the changing rooms about kids jumping in and getting in the way. There's lanes that you can swim your lengths in. If you're not in a lane but in the family areas, then suck it up moaners and expect kids.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the spa. My favourite steam room is the amethyst crystal, but I do wonder how many other people's sweat I'm sat in, are they cleaned daily? The hydropool is amazing, a must after a gruelling workout with Izaac!\n\nThe changing rooms are ok, with little corner cubicles here and there. The cleaners are always around too. The showers stay on and you don't have to keep jabbing a button lol The changing room doesn't smell which is one reason I won't use Moorways; there's stink and I refuse to go there, if DL's had of stunk the same, I wouldn't have joined. Only thing is, I accidentally left my blue silicone beaded wristlet in the family changing room, photo of similar attached. If you have it, hand it in, I got it from a cruise ship and can't get another.",

I use the swimming pool 2-3 times per week and they have increased public and lane swimming times over this summer which is greatly appreciated. Yes - the changing facilities could do with a make over, however I can see that they can't do everything at once. The newly refurbed gym looks great! I also use the sauna a lot and it's perfect for me and finally we've got a cold shower - hallelujah :-) The steam room on the other hand needs attention. It has a bizarre smell. I also go to fitness classes from time to time and Jacqui is really my hero when it comes to classes - whether it's yoga, pilates, dancing or body con - she rocks them all! This leisure centre ain't perfect, but what is?! I enjoy the laid back and friendly atmosphere and I'm glad they offer swim classes for the school and kids in general as well as other team sports sessions. It feels like a welcoming hub to me and that is what matters.",

The gym is very run down, a lot of the equipment needs repairs/upholstering, everything felt very unmaintained, out of order toilets and showers, the areas with smaller footfall showed layers of dirt and dust. On arrival when asking for a day pass, no help from the people on the reception desk pretty much left to fend for yourself. Surely a small ‘have you been here before?’ Question would help and then an offer to just show you around so you get the layout of the land. Seems to have a lack of gym equipment only seems to be one of each machine which I imagine at peak times would not be an enjoyable gym experience. Felt very small and cramped. Definitely needs some more attention, it feels like it’s been opened a year ago and just left to fend for itself no upkeep.",

It's always busy, the least I ever see is 30ish people but it's up to 150 plus at peak times. It is a big gym, but you'll still queue for equipment. The male changing rooms and toilets are often gross and smell bad, I've never seen them totally clean in the months I've been going. The pros are, lots of equipment (but still not enough at peak times), in theory a good location, when parking isn't being used by Christmas shoppers, and a wide range of gym users. There are a few not so friendly groups of teenage and young adult boys/men but most people just mind their own business and work out.",

          "reviewText": "First time visit to Onroute Truckstop Jcn 29 of the M1. First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

The truck stop is clean and so are the facilities beside they’re pretty run down and need a lot of attention. Maybe a facility container would be a good interim solution.\nOn the con side: It is quite noisy due to the A38 only a few yards away from the lorry park.

All provided by ADS. Staff couldn’t do enough for me. Seems extremely secure as gates locked at night and constant security patrols.\nAll in all an extremely decent place as far as I’m concerned.

Free parking in their own designated parking lot is included.\n\nClimbing down the stairs in your underwear to get to the showers was a point of concern. The hotel was difficult to find, as it's not clearly indicated as The Elk Inn on any sign except right next to the entrance. Actually, it's *identical* to the East Midlands Guest House - it's the red brick building on the corner of Osmaston Rd and Douglas St. I don't know why they're using two different names for the same place. The room was very basic, indeed. It's only a place to sleep for a few days. There was *no* room service at all on any of the 5 days I spent there.",

While they may have offered me a room switch when I requested one as I wasnt getting on with my flatmates, they were more than happy to dispose of hundreds pounds of equipment and clothes when I went home during the second lockdown. I suffer from mobility issues and extreme hip pain and having refused to offer me any help moving my heavy furniture while I was actually living there they reneged on their promise to keep my things safe. Aside from that the maintenance staff are extremely unreactionary and our flat was littered with mechanical faults, my sink wouldnt drain water, the shower made an awful sound when turned on and when our toilet wouldnt flush it took weeks for them to offer assistance.

Theres a tv in the living room which has great quality.\n\nThere is more than enough cupboard and fridge/freezer space in the kitchen. There is also an eating island.\n\nThere are plenty of plug sockets throughout the flat and bedrooms.\n\nThere is a new double vending machine with very convenient items that you may need in an emergency. Toilet rolls, milk, toothbrushes, snacks, ready meals, drinks etc\n\nThere is a wonderful outdoor social space with fairy lights which would be great for parties during the night time in summer. There are also plenty of other seating areas throughout the site.\n\nThe hot water in the showers have never run out even though I'm sharing with 6 people.\n\nThere are 2 showers and 2 toilets so I never have to wait to get access to one.\n\nThere are designated smoking areas.\n\nThere is a common room which is always warm and has many books and a tv, a pool table, table tennis and comfy chairs.\n\nThere is always somebody helpful in the office whether we need to collect post or chat or report any maintenance issues.\n\nThere is a bus that stops across the road from the accommodation which goes to the university and doesn't stop too far from the city centre. The bus is designated to Abbey lodge students only.\n\nThere are also 2 convenience stores right at the bottom of the drive.\n\nAlso a bonus is i have great flatmates who all get along.\n\nThe only downside is i dont get very good service in the entire area as a whole (including inside of the accomodation) so there may be specific spots in your room which are best to make a call but this isn't a fault of the accomodation itself.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that the rooms are a really really good price. The cheapest student accomodation price youll find in derby. Even the university owned accomodation rooms are ancient and overpriced.\n\nLiving at Abbey lodge I am able to eat well, have a social life and save a lot of my student loan at the same time.",

We were put in a large field which was reasonably quiet other than the sound of the road at night. Ground was fairly level and well drained although drainage seems to be aided by rocks about 4 inches under the ground. Because of this, it was very difficult to peg the tent down effectively. We ended up with about 8 bent pegs and for the ones that went in all the way,  many had to go on such an angle that I wouldn't have trusted the tent to stay put should the wind have gotten up.\n\nWe called upon arrival as there was nobody in reception and a very pleasant gentlemen came to take our money and tell us where to camp. He didn't however tell us where anything was; toilets, bins etc were all needed to be found for ourselves. The toilets and showers near the reception; whilst dated, were adequate, and we did see them cleaned. Hot water pressure was low from taps though so came through at a trickle and if you have a shower, don't leave it too late as we did end up having a luke warm shower later one evening. We never found the 'luxury' toilet block.\n\nAll in all it was easy to find, conveniently located and adequate to throw your tent down for a night or two to get your head down. It isn't luxurious, but then you're not paying the ridiculous price that some campsites are asking these days.",

Pod was clean and contained all the essentials you could possibly think of. Each pod has their own shower and toilet facility within the \"toilet block\" for the pods. It's a clean, small, amd peaceful site with plenty of walks in the area and a nice pub within a 15-20 minute walk. Great first experience in a pod. I would highly recommend this camp site. P.S. we greatly appreciated the owners letting us park our car and small caravan on site while we used the pod as we didn't want to unload and put down  the feet just for a one night, shirt stay.

Read a few reviews about the guy booking you in being obnoxious and rude etc when checking in, he was absolutely fine and pleasant with us, so don't judge the this site based on other people's personal opinions, everyone has worse days than others,",

There's lots of other pubs around and within walking distance. We stayed for Download, as we always do, and although it gets busy, it's never rowdy. Please be aware, that when it's busy, the showers may not be that good. Lots of water points and an elsan point that works well. Lovely marina with ducks and swans that wander the park. There's a bus stop at the end of the entry lane, 5 minutes walk, with 24 hour buses to the airport and Donnington park and to Derby too. Bus fares are capped at £3.00 so you can park and leave your car. If you want curry, then get the bus to Castle Donnington village as they have some superb curry houses. There's a Chinese within a 2 minute bus ride, 5 minutes drive or a 25 minutes walk. Great location although you can hear the motorway as it's near the M1 and A50 but don't let it put you off. It's a good park",

Unfortunately while we were there a fight broke out in the campsite pub which made it not possible for us to go the next evening with our kids. The toilet had fecies running up to it from several meters away up to and in the male toilets and was not cleaned up all day a long with 3 of the toilets being blocked which was also not cleaned all day. The shower only trickled water and cost an extra £2 to use per person.\n\nAs stated all the staff were great and the facilities looked amazing. Unfortunately upkeep was very unsanitary probably the worst we have seen most likely due to being understaffed is our only guess. The fighting obviously can happen however with children it's not what you want your kids around. We left early and only stayed one night and won't be returning because of all the above which ashame as it has all the catching of a great park.",

Lovely areas separated by hedges and trees.\nThe toilets and showers were clean and spacious as was the pot washing area.\nWe walked to the local pub (The Gate) which is as other people have said about a 20-30 min walk down a long hill. Well worth a visit for the food, also a playground if you have kids. People have said they ordered taxis to get back to the farm but the walk back really isn't that bad.  We also walked into Matlock which takes you through woods and past Lumsdale waterfall. The walk took about 45 mins and again was worth it.\nAll in all this is a great little campsite with very nice owners.",

Definitely worth doing just for the views but the first bit of the walk is very hard going up hill. I only have one criticism of the campsite which needs addressing.. the washing up water needed to be hotter. I ended up boiling a kettle for the washing up because the sink water wasn't hot, also didn't bother with the showers because of the same issues. All in all excellent value for money though.",

Everything you need and expect to be there.\nPlenty for the young ones to enjoy. 3 big play areas. A giant sandpit which is under cover. So great for rainy days! There are pool/football tables too! Again , under cover for rainy days entertainment! Fishing is great for everyone to have a go at! A great pond and well stocked!\nWe tried the café and we loved it! Great choice, great price and, great taste! Their Latte's are out of this world!

I enjoy going to the gym, apart from helping me to achieve my goals in relation to fitness, it is a really friendly place, the other members are great, help to provide motivation and are happy to engage in friendly banter, for me - its also a social experience.    The classes at the gym are excellent, there are a wide range of activities to suit most people. I regularly attend box fit, group cycle, core stability, yoga, swim fit and step.  There are other classes I haven't tried yet, but all are well worth checking out with very positive feedback from people who participate. The classes really demonstrate in a practical way just how brilliant all the instructors are:  Swimming at the Leisure Centre is also excellent, clean facilities,  enough lockers. great showers.  The sauna and steam rooms are also available if needed.   There is a separate area available for the little ones.   The swimming classes for kids are also great.  So yes - attending is a positive experience, Reception staff are brilliant and there is even an app you can use to book onto classes , its really easy to use.     I'd recommend joining 100%",

The pool is heated to a nice warm temperature and is a good size so your not crowded and on top of each other. There's also a kiddy pool as well with a big splashing water tap. The onsite Caffe serves both hot and cold food for a good price. We spent £18 for two burgers, a tea, a cookie, a hot sausage roll and a latte. It's an amazing activity for all the family as there's a grassy area next to the pool which allows for a picnic to be taken. You can go in and out of the pool as much as you like during your allotted time. There are also lockers both in the changing room and pool side which cost a pound. The changing rooms have showers which are a good size too as well as free hairdryers. I would highly recommend, it's a great day out and they also offer midnight swims.",

From the outside, it looks like an unassuming tin shed, but as you walk through the modern, clean changing rooms there are posters of other iconic lidos - Saltdean, London Fields, Brockwell - and Jubilee Park certainly holds its own in this illustrious company. The main pool is 33m and gently heated to around 24° when we visited. There is also a sizeable learner pool with a giant tap which provides intermittent downpours. The pools are clean and well-maintained with attentive lifeguards. A smashing pool which is operating an extended heated season for 2024 - don't miss out!",

The pool is clean and well maintained for all to enjoy. Unfortunately my experience wasn't completely satisfying.. the pool quickly became busy and crowded, there were signs that children couldn't go past if they aren't confident swimmers which is understandable but it means everyone is bottled together in the shallow end making it difficult to swim, relax and enjoy. I took my son who is a confident swimmer aged 8 and who has had swimming lessons at jubilee park, to the deep end and we was quickly called on by the life guard who wanted my son to prove he could swim from sign to sign.. it turned from a fun, relaxed and playful swim, which is what I paid for, into a swimming lesson just to have a little bit more room to swim.. this pool seems more of a strict regime swim then enjoyable.. many parents were called on by the life guards for doing small playful things with their children in the pool and being told to stop.. takes the fun out of it all.. I 100% agree swimming should be safe and pool safety is important but this pool feels over the top.. I feel like I've paid for a regimental swim and not a fun, relaxing family swim. Over all jubilee is a beautiful place to visit and to bring the kids for a swim but best visiting on less busy days.",

It was impeccably clean! Loved that we could connect music to the sauna to play as we swam! The views were amazing, some building work is happening in front of the building but this didn’t spoil our opinions of the place! The showers were perfect and again spotless! The only thing we felt was missing was a couple of hooks within the changing rooms to hang clothes/bags! Pool was just the right temperature for us!! We will definitely be back!",

The hot shower was a nice touch, and the little sauna with a Bluetooth speaker was definitely a highlight – it was so relaxing to unwind while listening to our own music!\n\nAs a former pool owners who used to rent out our own facility, we know the effort and dedication it takes to keep a space like this so immaculate. We know firsthand how much hard work goes into maintaining a pool and they are doing fantastic job.\n\nPerfect for a family swim or just some time to relax and recharge.

The pool isn’t wide enough for 10 swimmers so your constantly having to navigate around another body or two to avoid a collision, and lord help you if you break out into an over arm swim as it’s just not the done thing amongst geriatric swimmers, as it’s breast stroke all the way.\nAfter watching blue balls of fluff floating on top of the water pass me by from time to time during my swim, the sight of a clump, and I mean clump of grey/black hair floating next to me made my stomach turn as I wasn’t sure if it was the chest, head, or pubic variety, but I was out of there sharpish as it was totally vulgar.",

As the facility is just for personal training clients it is never crowded. All the equipment is excellently maintained and there are showers to use too.\nMy personal trainer Josh is brilliant. He is always professional but has a great sense of humour and always makes the sessions enjoyable. From the first assessment , everything is a very personal approach, the sessions are designed for my specific needs and goals. Josh also spent the time to make me an individual nutrition plan to help me achieve my weight loss goal. We do a check in once a week to discuss progress and makes plans for the following week.\nThe sessions are updated and changed as you progress so there’s no boredom or stagnation.  There is also a fantastic sports therapist on site every Thursday. She really knows her stuff and is amazing if you have any sort of injury or general niggles. I would 100% recommend Signature health and fitness to anyone wanting to improve their health and well-being and fitness in a personal, professional environment that also allows for a bit of fun.

The disinfectant spray and wipes were removed about a year ago so you have to settle for sweaty and sticky equipment if you don't take your own wipes. The weekday cleaning lady with dark hair and glasses is really lovely and does an amazing job, the locker rooms (I can only vouch for the ladies) really suffer when she is not in.\nThe ladies gym area is such a good feature. It allows you to have access to equipment in a safe space which usually is never available in the main gym.\nI avoid going to the gym after 4pm as it is over run with groups people who crowd machines, even if not using them and never seem to get moved on.\nSometimes trying to find a staff member can be an impossible task.\nThe classes are good, although they were cut back last year so it makes it hard to attend the ones I want to around work. The best class is run by Tiff which is the yoga. I've been going to her class for 4 years now and it really has changed my life from giving me coping mechanisms to deal with unwanted thoughts to strengthening my body.\nOverall it's a good gym and it's convenient to where I live.",

Not seen since Glasgow 1994. Parking was ok, large yard, well organised if you don't get boxed in, the toilets and shower were like Cub Camp 1978. If you have a less than clean toilet area at least invest 30p in each cubicle so there is a hook to keep stuff off the floor - 2 stars. Restaurant - 0 stars. When you have a lorry park, rammed for the evening @ £24 each, surely a quality breakfast is a possibility - filter coffee or espresso? Just because there is a lot on the plate doesn't make it good. Very few in for breakfast, it would be busier if the breakfast was better.  I sometimes wish that the owners of these places would take a trip to mainland Europe to see what a truckers restaurant is supposed to be like in this day and age. I try to support smaller establishments rather than give money to Moto etc but please help make our job a little more comfortable when away from family home for the week!  Thanks",

So I have no issues with my cleaner,  only genuine praise.  My only gripe is that I expected the company to contact me after a few weeks to check everything was OK etc. This didn't happen although when I contacted the company their representative did at that time ask how things were going.",

This one is standard on first appearance however the room I had was facing a huge busy network of roads, the traffic was so loud and meant I had a disturbed sleep. The bed was tiny for a double,  lumpy and uncomfortable which also contributed to a poor night's sleep. The worst of all was the sink in my room 304, It stunk of sewage. I should imagine it was because the drains needed cleaning, but it put me off using the sink, especially brushing my teeth felt like a risk. The shower head was also grimy and orange, I  felt grubby using it and showered again when I got home. All in all not worth staying again as these things should be kept clean as a minimum standard. I did tell the staff on check out, they just said, 'Thanks for letting me know' Once they've got your money they don't really care I suppose!",

          "reviewText": "Hayes Wharf is one of the nearest accommodation sites to Lincoln University, with the exception of the University-run sites and possibly The Junxion (Mezzino). Located on Carholme Road, marginally within the West End region of Lincoln, its surroundings bear less of the urban intensity as that of other sites, but essential facilities are conveniently accessible (including a small Sainsbury's and the West End Tap, a micropub located one street to the North). A particularly attractive local feature is the immediately accessible Fossdyke footpath, running along the Roman canal and towards the cycle route 64.\nBeing in its 14th year of existence, I was expecting the building to be riddled with battle scars inflicted by the carefree habitation of rowdy students. However, it is remarkably well-maintained and the interior was largely refurbished in 2018, providing a new kitchen and re-decorated bedrooms. Whilst the site's design and execution lacks some of the elegance and simplicity as at Cygnet Wharf (my 1st year accommodation), its appearance actually looks quite respectable today... something which cannot be said for the related Pavilions site of the same age: a severe collection of monolithic, steel-framed blocks, snaking ominously across the South of Lincoln.\nThe site is very secure, requiring an electric key fob to enter the site, and again to enter your own block, and then a key for the flat and bedroom.\nThe bedrooms wildly vary in size and layout, depending on the specification chosen and the part of the site it happens to be. My room (Silver en-suite) is exceptionally spacious and has a view of upper Lincoln and the Cathedral (don't get too excited, some rooms will have a view of a wall). In the room, there is actually too much storage to completely fill, which is only a good thing, and the sliding storage crates under the bed are particularly useful. The desk chair provided is not an adjustable office chair, but is just about comfortable enough, despite using hard plastic. The deskspace is very generous, 60cm deep and extending the full width of the room (2.7m in my case). A large slot has been cut out of part of the desk, under which is the electric radiator, to stop the desk surface from overheating and being destroyed. The radiator operates on a maximum 2 hour timer, and seems quite capable for the room size.\nA major rearrangement of the bed and surrounding furniture was required to make the bedside light switches actually be beside the bed. There is also an additional LED spotlight above the bed which is useful for reading, although the light is very bright and cold white in tone (made suitable for night use by taping an orange Quality Street wrapper over it). The bathroom is the usual arrangement, but the shaving light and power source above the mirror is a useful addition. Once the inevitable teething troubles of blocked shower drains are addressed, you will find that the showers work well enough. The electric shower unit is quite underpowered, but should be adequate for those who have not been spoiled with mixer showers like myself.\nThe kitchen works quite well for five people, each person has two large cupboards, one drawer, and a shelf in the fridge and freezer. This leaves one remainder cupboard, an under-sink cupboard and an excessively sized cleaning cupboard that is larger than the fridge: the exclusive home of a mop. In addition to the single ***INDUCTION*** cooker/oven and sink, is a kettle, a microwave oven, and two rubbish bins. There is no toaster included, nor a vacuum cleaner. The lounge features a modern television, with 'smart' features.\n\nInevitably, there will be problems which need fixing by the maintenance team, and so far they have been extremely helpful and efficient. The staff overall have been excellent - incredibly friendly and keen to make personal conversation. My first month here has proven that Hayes Wharf is a very comfortable place to live, and that its non-University ownership has no negative effect on quality.",

Site is part of a county park so lots of good walks to be had, plus bus route just a short walk away for visits to historic Lincoln, which is well worth a visit for either history or the shops (used to live only 10 miles away so regular visitor). But back to the site .... it's well laid out, with booking online and coded security gates for access. Pitches have hook up, and some are hard standing, and some are dedicated for disabled use. The toilets and showers are separate for men and woman, and each has 2 toilets and 2 showers with lashings of hot water. There is a separate wash room with 4 sinks and again it's immaculatey clean. Tv reception is good as is mobile signal with THREE/Smarty for streaming etc. Looking forward to the next 4 days.",

The pitches are nice and large so we had plenty of space to pitch our tent and have an area to put our windbreakers up on the side. The toilets and showers were kept nice and clean as well as the kitchen area. The site is nice and quiet bar the donkeys and chickens! but we loved having the animals there. The staff were great and can be found when needed. The fishing was good but didn’t seem to see any fish larger than 12/13lb. You are also locked in as the site has a locked gate which code changes regularly to give you piece of mind. The kitchen area has a washing machine, a tumble dryer, a microwave and a kettle which was a pleasant surprise. There are also a selection of local attraction and takeaway leaflets to read. At the back of the lake there is a field which we let the dog have a run on although it is not fully enclosed it certainly was more than enough. We will definitely be visiting again.",

It's owners were very helpful and told me all about their plans for the site. It was easy to find and access was good. Water was available although at that time electric hookup wasn't. Since then they have done a lot of work improving the site putting in five individual hard standing bays and gravel road access to them along with ten grass pitches for tents. Electric hookup and a water point is available individually for all hard standing pitches and two bollards with four hookups for the tents. A toilet is available and showers are coming shortly.

          "reviewText": "We stayed on this site for 9 weeks: we had sold our house and were buying another nearby, so it was convenient.\nThe site is large with flat pitches, all have water and elec hook up. But there’s no dividing hedges, so no privacy.\nThe hardstandings are actually ash with a fine covering of gravel, which eventually gets moved about and the ash ends up inside your awning or caravan/motorhome.\nWhen they cut the grass they don’t pick up the cuttings. So if you step on the grass, the cuttings end up with the ash inside your awning or caravan/motorhome.\nIf you want to stay on a building site, fine. Otherwise go elsewhere. The view is a mixture of metal storage containers, vehicles, farm machinery, stacks of Thermalite blocks, bricks, paving slabs, plastic pipe, oil drums, old wooden pallets, building equipment, sand, gravel and rubble.\nThe shower block is a shower room. It’s very nice, but, with one shower, one toilet and one wash hand basin. The hot water on the basin is hardly more than a drip. Apparently, the site is licensed for 7 caravans/motorhomes and 10 tents – for ONE SHOWER and ONE TOILET?\nThe toilet seat doesn’t fit, it wobbles about. There’s no toilet roll holder, so the loo rolls sit on top of the cistern, which is continually wet with condensation – so the loo rolls are wet too.\nThere is a pot washing room, which we did use. But, personally I’d rather have a washing machine and drier. Beware if you are washing dishes and someone uses the chemical disposal point; your water will run cold until they are finished.\nThe owners are a couple of storytellers. First you will be told that the Wi-Fi is hardwired to each pitch (eh?).  Then they will say that the heating in the shower room comes on for 2 hours, morning and evening every day. Rubbish! I showered at least 45 times on this site and the heating was never on, even when it snowed!! I did complain and was told that Tony would sort it, he didn’t.  And they say that there’s a pumping station under the shower block, sorry “room”, which is capable of sending text messages, amazing.\nThere is no designated dog walk, despite what it says on their site. You will be directed out of the site onto the main road of the village and told to follow the public footpaths.\nThe first time I spoke to Tony he told me that I came from the rough end of town – twice. Then he insulted me about the time I had spent living in France. Then he became an expert in war games, telling me that as we were surrounded by Airfields, if Putin decided to invade (???) we wouldn’t stand a chance. I had planned to avoided him after that, but I didn’t have to; he ignored me completely. He could pass within 2 feet of me and just stare at the ground. Absolutely no hosting skills whatsoever.\nThere’s a five bar gate across the entrance which is closed whenever the Grandchildren are on site, which seemed to be pretty often. You can open the gate if you happen to be a 17 stone rugby player. If, like me, you are an 8 stone woman, you won’t be able to budge it without pulling a muscle – which I did. It’s total overkill for a 2 and 4 year old, especially considering there’s a pedestrian gate feet away with a simple gate latch.\nIf you do manage to get through the gate, more often than not, your access will be blocked by a tradesman’s vehicle. The owners were renovating some outbuildings into holiday cottages, and this seems to be the priority for the owners. They don’t seem bothered about anyone on the campsite, or the mess they have to stay in.\nNo one came to offer help when our awning collapsed under the weight of snow, or when high winds almost ripped it off altogether. They didn’t even notice.\nAs a CL site they are not permitted to have anyone stay for more than 14 days. Nonetheless, they were very happy to take our cash for 9 weeks, until someone complained that we'd been there so long. We were given 2 days notice to leave.",

We stayed at Willowholt for 2 nights with family, and we enjoyed our stay.\nThe tiolets and shower blocks are brand new and are definitely a bonus to the upcoming site.\nI believe the site is upgrading the site in areas as the entrance has a lot of diggers, etc, and the new bulit tiolet block is the only thing that is relatively new. The washing up area could do with a little upgrading.\nThe boathouse is a nice touch to the site. Unfortunately, the night we were planning to use it, the staff put a sign out to say bar only so we didn't get to try the food.\nMaybe next time.\n\nIf your camping with young kids be asked to be put near the park as it was a bonus for us.\nThe park is massive, and our children made friends with others and used the park the whole time we were there. Great addition to the site.\nThe pitch area was fine, big enough, and pitched next to the family, which we requested.\nBeautiful views over the lake.\n\nTake earplugs, the geese that live on the site fly over and make a racket at 4am.\n\nI've given 4 stars for service as when we arrived the lady who served me was a little moody and said if we didn't leave by 11 am the next day they won't be returning the £10 they take for the gate fob to get in and out the camp site.\nWe, of course, are always aware of a checkout time, and 11am is a good time for checkout, but the way it came across wasn't very friendly. Even if it was 11.05am, we wouldn't be getting our money back. I feel sorry for anyone who gets there just a few minutes late (as of course that can happen) with a car full of kids. Things are unpredictable.\n\nOverall, a good stay and make sure you take a trip into Woodhall spa to the bakery delicatessen absolutely 5 star cakes, baps, chocolates our highlight of the trip.",

There are pheasants lining the road and we even saw a deer. Accommodation was spot on. Clean, welcoming and warm. Table was set when we arrived and the heating was on. Modern kitchen with dishwasher and washing machine. Tv in each bedroom and one in dining area. Signal could be hit and miss but you’re in the middle of nowhere, embrace it!  Lovely little walk by the river which the dog enjoyed being off lead. Nice to see the barges too. It’s definitely a place to get away from it all, hot tub was a bonus. We had an issue with the tub one night but as soon as I reported it Gary was straight out to sort it. No issues.",

As  we had our little dog with us we checked if dogs were allowed  in the local pubs and we found only one pub in the vicinity that served food and allowed dogs. Many of the pubs were closed down or didnt serve food.\nWe had a fab day out in Lincoln which we loved so beautiful and lots to see especially the Cathedral and the Castle. Didnt enjoy Boston so much it was quite run down although St Botulphs was beautiful and the people in there very nice and helpful and let us take our fur baby in.\nThere is a gym on site but we didnt use it. Not much else to do so dont imagine its great for kids.\nUnable to find anywhere to eat on our last night i resorted to shopping and cooking which isnt usually part of our plans on our annual mini breaks.\nWe enjoyed the hot tub which was lovely and warm and very clean. We had a slight issue with a dripping tap in the kitchen which flooded part of the kitchen, however a lovely member of staff came to our rescue and got us dried out.\nJust a few slight changes could have scored the site higher.\n+ a bedside light in the single room would have made reading in bed much nicer.\n+ No mattress or Pillow protectors when we stripped the beds with quite unpleasantly stained mattress and pillow\n+ some hooks in the bathroom to hang your clothes while you shower\n+ tidy up around the back of the lodges\nOn a positive note there are plenty of plug sockets, TVs, places to relax inside and out.

          "reviewText": "This place is amazing the minute I walked through the door in my Lodge I felt like I was in a completely different place, solid wood everywhere but with the modern finer things, log burner in the centre off the massive open planned space, traditional yet modern kitchen with everything you could possibly need, such a warm a cosy environment also with that elegant feeling. The outdoor areas are amazing one of which is a canopied outdoor luxury seating area with a bbq beyond what I've ever seen, wine cooler, fridge and 2 fire pits. The bathroom and showers are a little walk down from where you are but 3 toilets and 2 showers plenty of towels and not your typical cheap shampoo and shower gel. I work away allot and unfortunately I was herw by myself and working nights so didn't have chance to explore everything this place has to offer but I'll definitely be coming back with my family and friends",
