Unfortunately when it came time to leave the pool it made getting things from the lockers harder as it felt quite tight.\n\nInto the pool: the pool itself is a beach style pool with a wave machine as well as a broken - bucket fill activity (not sure how else to describe it - the joystick did nothing and the buckets had to be filled manually). The waterfall mushroom was nice and the small slide although I think a slightly bigger slide would have been appreciated by the kids there. I'm not sure exactly what the giant ball barricade was for, other kids were climbing on it and not getting told off and it did provide a sheltered area from the wave machine. It was a nice touch that an inflatable net and several beach balls as well as soft balls were available but they were quickly taken if you didn't get to them quick enough. There were also water cannons that could be moved and angled but these did not get much attention from the children there.\nThe humidity and the pool was much cooler than I was expecting and another swimmer commented that the day before when they visited that people were going blue it was that cold. Which is surprising as you would expect warmer waters over a half term when more children are going to be using the facilities. Even I found the water to be a bit chilly on the day so had to keep an eye on those I was with.\nFrom the pool you can see the \"cafeteria\" if you wish to call it that. When we went swimming over the lunchtime period and from the pool you could see shutters down so it was closed and your options were two vending machines so we didn't bother to explore it after for a warm drink to warm up with.",

Changing rooms are huge and even have a tv in there, plenty of showers, hair driers and plug sockets for straighteners etc. It has to be the only gym that has 6 tv screens that you can put your headphones into whilst working out on the treadmils, bikes, cross trainer etc, plus they play all the best old school music.",

The gym has two strength and free weights areas, good fitness classes, an excellent spin studio, and a large pool that usually has lanes open. The sauna is small, and the lower benches sometimes get moisture damage, although they do get replaced. The steam room is generally fine, but the area where your back rests can feel a bit slimy. The cool dip pool is great, and there’s an outdoor gym area, although I’ve never seen anyone using it.\n\nThe showers work, but they could definitely use some attention. Some locks don’t work properly, some shelving is loose or tilted, and there’s noticeable wear and tear in some cubicles.\n\nThe everyday staff are consistently friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I’ve always had a good experience with them.\n\nWhere the gym falls short is in administration and communication regarding policies. When I joined, I was told off-peak access was until 5 pm, but in reality, your pass stops working at 4:30. This means you need to ask staff to let you in manually, which wasn’t explained upfront and can feel awkward. To be fair, the off-peak package is good overall, especially with unrestricted access on weekends, but the weekday cut-off should be clearly explained.\n\nThe complimentary guest passes were also disappointing. They come with restrictions that aren’t made clear at the start. Guests receive membership sales calls afterward without having given permission. This makes the passes feel more like a sales tool than a genuine perk.\n\nOverall, it’s a strong gym with solid facilities and excellent staff. However, clearer communication, more transparent policies, and some attention to the changing rooms would significantly improve the member experience.",

There are no barriers or security checks, so it seems like anyone could walk in without paying.\n\n6. **Repeated Issues**: These issues weren't just a one-time occurrence.

Even before 2020 I had never visited a gym which didn't provide wipes!\nTwo days after my last visit, I came down with flu so I won't be going back.\n\nThe gym is big and very busy at all times. There is lots of equipment but the equipment isn't grouped logically and it's not in a good state of repair.\n\nThe open-plan binary changing rooms are like a 1960's bording school and are not inclusive or in-keeping with the times. The showers were warm but the spray comes out in a cone shape so you have to keep moving back and forth, side to side, to get water on yourself. The showers also share a joint run off, so you'll be standing in the next person's dirty water while you're in there.\n\nThe exit turnstiles were confusing because you don't use the keypad on the turnstile you want to exit through, you use the keypad on the next one over. 🤦",

He gave me a guest pass, and I’d always heard it was a premium gym, so I was curious to see what it was all about. Honestly, I left feeling a bit underwhelmed.\n\nThe gym area itself isn’t that big. It feels a bit tight, especially when a few people are using machines or free weights. For the price members are paying, I expected a much larger space and a better range of equipment. It’s not awful, but it definitely doesn’t feel as high end as it claims to be.\n\nOne thing I did really like was the tennis area. Both the indoor and outdoor courts are a great size and in really good condition. If you’re into tennis, that’s probably one of the best parts of the club.\n\nThe pools were another highlight. Both the indoor and outdoor pools were very clean, with a nice relaxing atmosphere. The water was a good temperature and the overall setup felt calm and well maintained. But there’s only one jacuzzi, which honestly felt like a letdown. It was constantly full, and with the price of membership, I really expected there to be at least one more. It just doesn’t seem like enough for the number of people using the club.\n\nThe steam room was actually really nice. It’s spacious, very clean, and has that relaxing eucalyptus scent, which gives it a proper spa vibe. That was one area where it really did feel like a premium experience.\n\nOne thing that did annoy me though and felt a bit ridiculous was being charged two pounds for a towel as a guest. At a place like this, where membership isn’t cheap, you’d think something as basic as a towel would be included for guest passes. It just came off as unnecessarily stingy.\n\nOn a more positive note, the changing rooms were spotless. Modern, clean, with good showers, plenty of lockers, and all the basics done right. No complaints there.\n\nOverall, it was a decent first visit and there were a few things I really liked, but I left feeling like the place doesn’t fully live up to the price tag. It has potential, but they could definitely improve on the gym space, add more facilities like a second jacuzzi, and maybe be a bit less tight with things like towels for guests.",

He gave me a guest pass, and I’d always heard it was a premium gym, so I was curious to see what it was all about. Honestly, I left feeling a bit underwhelmed.\n\nThe gym area itself isn’t that big. It feels a bit tight, especially when a few people are using machines or free weights. For the price members are paying, I expected a much larger space and a better range of equipment. It’s not awful, but it definitely doesn’t feel as high end as it claims to be.\n\nOne thing I did really like was the tennis area. Both the indoor and outdoor courts are a great size and in really good condition. If you’re into tennis, that’s probably one of the best parts of the club.\n\nThe pools were another highlight.

From the moment we arrived, the experience was seamless, starting with getting our entrance tickets and picking up some swimming essentials like goggles and swim caps from the well-stocked shop.\n\nThe pool area was impressive, offering something for everyone. The highlight for the more experienced swimmers in our group was definitely the blue slide. It’s an exhilarating ride that drops you into a 2.5-meter-deep pool—perfect for those confident in the water. The red slide, on the other hand, was a big hit with everyone. It’s long and winding, offering a thrilling but safe ride, ideal for those who aren’t strong swimmers but still want a bit of excitement.\n\nFor the younger kids, the orange and yellow slides were perfect. They’re shorter and designed with little ones in mind, though they do have height restrictions to ensure safety. The kids couldn’t get enough of them and kept going back for more.\n\nAfter all the fun, we took a break at the café. It’s a comfortable space with a good selection of snacks and drinks, perfect for recharging before heading back to the pool. Overall, it was a wonderful day filled with laughter, excitement, and great memories for both families.",

However these instructors are clearly pros with little children and not only managed to persuade an initially crying child into the water and enjoy, but by the second lesson got them to actively participate.

Sometimes it’s OK, other times it’s very poor.\n\nA few months back there were several weeks without access to the jacuzzi due to mechanical faults, damages to the steam room, out of service showers, out of service dryers, rubble in the swimming pool toilets where you’re expected to be bare foot, and very dirty changing rooms.

Sometimes it’s OK, other times it’s very poor.\n\nA few months back there were several weeks without access to the jacuzzi due to mechanical faults, damages to the steam room, out of service showers, out of service dryers, rubble in the swimming pool toilets where you’re expected to be bare foot, and very dirty changing rooms.

Half of the gents was shut off with a barrier. That's fine, it was a quiet time of the day, so why keep it all open (less cleaning). Cleanliness-wise, no issue, it was clean & smelt okay. What was really disappointing was firstly despite the \"caution hot water\" notices on each sink, not a single hot tap worked. In fact, some were hanging off & one was even taped up (so staff know about the problem). Secondly, not a single soap dispenser had any soap in it. The final thing that then prompted me to write this review was the fact that the only two accessible hand-dryers didn't work either (& there are no paper towels).\n\nAll in all, far from the 'Welcome' you'd expect from a Welcome Break. Management at this establishment should be ashamed. All things that should be easily fixable.",

The services provided are good, with clean showers, toilets, water, microwave, and vending machines with a cafe bolted on. I really could not thank them enough for everything they did for me this evening so I hope this review helps show some of that gratitude. Above all the price for 12 hours parking is less than a night out payment. So if you're in the area then come get a good night and also support a family business full of people who have restored some faith in humanity!

I felt completely safe during my stay (in the 4 bed female room) but it was just a weird set up…I don’t know. The lockers under the bed made so sense and didn’t lock haha. No idea what the space was before a hostel.",

I wasnt expecting much but what i was given wasnt fit for a dog to sleep in. Fecies on the walls and floor. Dried vomit on the carpet and only piece of unbroken furniture  (a chair) . The cooker was so dirty it could not be used .it had furry mold all over the inside and the fridge was caked in green black slime with slimy food remnants in it. To make matters even worse the only washing facility, a shower,  was broken and if the water was turned on at all the bathroom flooded with brown smelly water from the backed up drains.  The table and chzir provided were broken into several pieces and stacked in the corner of the room. My 9 month old choked on a shard of wood thtat splintered off whilst i was trying to clean .i reported these problems to a member of maintenance staff who was very rude and insisted that he had cleaned the room himself and that the furniture just needed to be bashed back together. I complained to the housing  officer who placed me there . She came and viewed the room and said she was sorry and utterly disgusted. She asked if i had anywhere else i could stay until the room was sorted out and  new furniture was found. I came back and spent 4 consecutive days cleaning . But i could not stay overnight as there were no washing facility and no cooking facility.   21 days later the shower was fixed and a chair from the tenancy agreement for  admin office was loaned to me. I gave the keys back and continued to sleep on tbe living room floor of a friends house with my children. Im still wating for the housing officer , cardiff council and the housing association who run adams court to contact me .3 months on im still on that sofa still homeless .",

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, making you feel genuinely welcome.\n\nTip for the men’s shower: if you take an evening shower, bring a headlamp – the motion sensor tends to forget you after a short while! 😆",

It also has a good gym with range of equipment, and rooms with a variety of classes throughout the week.",

A decent size of lockers available, the taller one for my folded crutch in it easily.\n\nI used the accessible changing room, which was amazing. It's the first one I've uses that felt intentionally designed and not a forgotten ads one. Even had a seat with handles on which I uses to dress. Loo and shower also in there.\n\nI didn't use cafe or anything, went there, swim, went out. Changing was great and pool was fab. Nothing more to say really.",

As a Physical Therapist, Fitness enthusiast and Natural Bodybuilder, training is very important to me. Even on holiday. Iv trained in Gyms all over the World and this Gym is up there as one of the best gyms iv ever trained in. Huge.. Huge and Great range of equipment.. Great atmosphere. The staff and members are great, very friendly and welcoming. It's got multiple main gym floors, Ladies only Gym, Cardio room, Fitness class Rooms, Outdoor covered training area, Shop, sport supplements, meals, clothing in the reception, Sunbeds if you are into that kinda thing,Huge and clean shower rooms, Sauna, steam, Fully equipped gym and stacked with the best equipment brands in the business(Hammer Strength, Nautilus ect) . An abundance of machines and mind blowing variety , free weights and cardio equipment. It's very spacious and non intimidating. No waiting around for a free bench or any other equipment it's that big and well stocked. Incredible studios too. I'd spend hours here. It's like a candy shop for Fitness lovers and anyone just starting their Fitness Journey. My photos aren't misleading.. It's that huge. I made a walk through video from changing rooms to Gyms end and it lasts more than 4 mins. I wish I could upload it to the review. Plenty  of parking as well. This place is more than a Gym. It is a very important fitness hub for the people of the area and surrounding towns. 5 stars. Simply incredible.",

The cold bucket showers are a great design with the water constantly moving, and the ice bath is also filtered and spotlessly clean (and very cold due to the constant moving water!).

Cooking at 92 degrees whilst overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches in the Gower, then gently cooling down by wandering out to sea. Or you can choose to pour a bucket of cold water over yourself (not for me).\nWe had opted for a communal session but it wasn’t fully booked so didn’t feel cramped, and I quite enjoyed chatting with other sauna guests and compare notes. Although set aside from the public beach, to get to the sea you will come across many beach goers but that only added to the uniqueness of the experience.\nWe did 3 rounds within the allotted time slot which was just right for us. Friendly staff member was available for questions and facilitate the experience.\nThe changing room is small but well thought out and I left my valuables with staff in the adjoining reception/office. We appreciated we could chill out on chairs after the session, and then stoped at the nearby beach cafe/shop for a coffee.\nIt was a really hot day but I would love to come back when it’s cold, dark and moody as imagine it will give you a great boost.\nCouple of tips for newbies - allow plenty of time for parking in high season, we queued for 15 minutes mid morning on a scorching bank holiday and only just made it, when we left the car park a few hours later the cars were tailing back half a mile or more. I also suggest to check the tide when booking as it can be a long walk when fully out. Public facilities near the sauna are very basic and I’m not sure if they are open in the evening.",

The mushrooms chicken was not cooked enough, I didn’t send it back because it was impossible to do anything about it after that and I didn’t want to find some ‘spices’ added. They couldn’t provide me the bank card receipt which I needed.

I was quite daunted at the prospect of returning to uni and having the lovely staff here to welcome me and make me feel at home has made my experience so far, out of this world. The building is gorgeous, very fruity, well maintained with excellent facilities we can all take advantage of.  A lovely study area, an interactive common room, an onsite gym, unlimited free printing and a 24/7 concierge who look after your parcels on your behalf.\n\nThe studio rooms are amazing, very homely and TRUELY beautiful. What brings all this together are the staff that work here. I love a rant and a general chat, to which most of the staff I have been able to share these lovely moments with. I'm a night owl and I love coming down to have a cuppa with the beautiful Susan (a few choice words to how she has her tea made lol) but I feel like I've known her for years and the charismatic Chris with the relaxed and chilled mood from Bode who is always up for some banter of a nighttime. I'm always doing me washing so I have ample opportunities to have a natter with them.\n\nOther staff who work in the day: Lauren Liv, Megan, Lauren, Theo, Robbie, Hughie along with Aggie and Sara, the best cleaners in the world who help maintain the building to a high standard, which is the norm here. Sorry to all the staff I can't remember the names of but honestly, you'll feel at home here. The staff are the ones that make your experience and will always be here to help with any issue that may arise. They're prompt, efficient and on the ball and once you have the opportunity to live here, you'll never want to leave. Thank you for a wonderful first month Team True <3",

The convenience of supermarkets and the city center are within arm's reach, making last-minute grocery runs or spontaneous outings incredibly easy. Moreover, it boasts excellent transport links, which were a lifesaver for someone like me who had to dash to various places around the city.\n\nStaff and Maintenance\nThe staff at Crown Place are genuinely lovely people who make a significant effort to create a welcoming atmosphere. Every issue I've had was promptly addressed, and any fixes were done at lightning speed. The management even gives a heads up before any big changes, which I really appreciated.\n\nAmenities Galore\nWhere do I even start? The cinema room was a perfect escape after a long day of classes, and the lounge was a cozy space ideal for both studying and socializing. The laundry room was well-maintained, and the gym facilities were fantastic. Although I never visited the gaming or karaoke rooms, the word around the dorm is that they're top-notch.\n\nRoom Features\nThe rooms feel modern, fresh, and impeccably designed. Mine still smelled brand new, and the interior design was on point. The room layout managed to encapsulate the essence of a cozy home while maximizing function. I particularly enjoyed the spacious shower and kitchen area—everything seemed meticulously planned. Let's not forget the many outlets and reliable wifi, which are student lifesavers.\n\nThe View\nOne of the best features of my room was the breathtaking view overlooking the river and the cityscape. It was especially magical at night. Additionally, if you're someone who values peace and quiet, the riverside rooms offer a serene atmosphere that's conducive for both relaxation and focus.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe only regret I have is that I can't live here forever, as I'm no longer a student. If you're looking for an unparalleled student living experience, look no further than Crown Place.",

It’s not completely without hope - the location is good - but it is so poorly maintained and frankly filthy that it’s unbearable to spend more than even a few hours in it. Unfortunately, we booked too late so this was our only affordable option, but even then we paid £120 for a double room for ONE night. I understand it was high demand as we came for a gig in Swansea, but I can’t imagine anyone paying to stay in this place.\n\nThe sheets were both stained and dirty - we found hairs and dead insects on top of the bedding. The floors and rugs were not cleaned - there was a plastic bottle under the bed and dust and dirt all over the floor. The bathrooms - one with a sink and toilet and another with a sink, toilet, and shower - are shared among the five rooms in the flat, which led to obvious issues. If there’s such high usage, the bathrooms should be cleaned more frequently, and better stocked - by midnight they had run out of toilet paper. The blinds in our room were completely gone, and our room stank to high heaven because it had not been properly aired out. It seems that they come in to change the sheets and that’s about it, I can’t confidently say anything else was cleaned. I have serious concerns about the level of hygiene in the flats. Funnily enough the kitchen was the cleanest room, probably because nobody used it.\n\nI cannot understand why this place is in business, the people who run it simply do not seem to care. Everything is poorly maintained, and while I have sympathy for the difficulties of running a small business, this place felt like a scam. These people do not care and clearly only provide bare minimum, if that, so do not let them take your money.",

The showers are combined with the toilets in individual cubicles which gives you lots of space. Great for families. Lots of lovely walks either along the coast or inards towards castle ruins, streams or the Gower Inn pub. Standard pitches come with a picnic table and firepit provided. My only minor gripe was that being the end of the season and rather empty, it would be nice if all campers were not placed next to each other. I appreciate this makes it easier to manage, but having neighbours, one a bit noisy, either side whilst 70% of the site was empty, felt a bit strange. You can specify a pitch for extra when booking.

After reading some reviews of this place we were a little dubious of how it would be let's just say some of the bad reviews are a little over the top. So let's start with arriving at front gates ok the place is jam packed with caravan of all shapes and size and yes does look a little untidy but and condensed but that's nothing to worry over if you consider price and what u get is fab for a campsite went to reception the people were lovely very helpful and polite so no complaints there all the areas were clean I'd go as far as saying the toilets/shower block were some of the cleanest ice see and that's the men's toilet the dish washing area was lovely with wash machines and tumble dryers. On to the swimming pool yes swimming pool that was fab for the kids they had absolute blast it's indoor pool with a little slide was awesome for the kids although it's not manned by a life guard to me not a real issues as it's free to use. Then you got a nice big park again the kids loved only issue is it's close to main entrance/ way in way out and no real path for kids to use and was rather busy but people drove sensible knowing kids were about. Then you got the club house indoor and outdoor area with patio heaters for when it gets chilly inside was great with bingo and live entertainment and reasonable priced drinks in turn makes for a good evening they do have like a kids club at times also have a small shop and a nice chip shop  then you have the top end of the side with a beautiful lake with many geese and ducks also does offer fishing at an extra cost the only thing I would say the place needs is some dog poo bins as a there was many dogs around including my own  but if I'm to be totally honest never saw any dog mess left anywhere there are plenty of regular bins about so  no big deal on the weekend we were there they had a car boot sale onsite which was good for a little nose.\nSo to conclude to us it felt like a mini holiday rather than camping in a field and will definitely be back for more great family trips glad we came and didn't listen to some of the negative reviews honestly go make your own opinions\nThanks for having us see you again very soon👍👍",

So let's start with arriving at front gates ok the place is jam packed with caravan of all shapes and size and yes does look a little untidy but and condensed but that's nothing to worry over if you consider price and what u get is fab for a campsite went to reception the people were lovely very helpful and polite so no complaints there all the areas were clean I'd go as far as saying the toilets/shower block were some of the cleanest ice see and that's the men's toilet the dish washing area was lovely with wash machines and tumble dryers. On to the swimming pool yes swimming pool that was fab for the kids they had absolute blast it's indoor pool with a little slide was awesome for the kids although it's not manned by a life guard to me not a real issues as it's free to use. Then you got a nice big park again the kids loved only issue is it's close to main entrance/ way in way out and no real path for kids to use and was rather busy but people drove sensible knowing kids were about. Then you got the club house indoor and outdoor area with patio heaters for when it gets chilly inside was great with bingo and live entertainment and reasonable priced drinks in turn makes for a good evening they do have like a kids club at times also have a small shop and a nice chip shop  then you have the top end of the side with a beautiful lake with many geese and ducks also does offer fishing at an extra cost the only thing I would say the place needs is some dog poo bins as a there was many dogs around including my own  but if I'm to be totally honest never saw any dog mess left anywhere there are plenty of regular bins about so  no big deal on the weekend we were there they had a car boot sale onsite which was good for a little nose.\nSo to conclude to us it felt like a mini holiday rather than camping in a field and will definitely be back for more great family trips glad we came and didn't listen to some of the negative reviews honestly go make your own opinions\nThanks for having us see you again very soon👍👍",

Around this time of year it wasn’t busy at all so we had lots of space for ourselves. The shop is cute too and the owner and Site ranger were both very friendly.

He took me to a huge pitch looking out on a green field with no one camping right next to me. I was sold. He checked back with me the next day to see if everything was good. What a great experience.\nThere was a large, clean sink, toilet and shower  block. A few doors down a washing up station with 4 sinks and pay washing machines.There was also a small shop, recycling area, all as you entered the park. Kids play equipment. Space to walk around.

Unfortunately, the pool was closed due to covid but the showers, toilets and washing up station were open. 20p for a hot shower is reasonable enough, I see people complain about this which is crazy. The showers and toilets were clean-ish I noticed there wasn't a toilet brush and someone had left rather alot of mess after themselves which I had walked in on then went directly to the next cubicle which was cleaner.  I brought my own toilet paper but I think that was also 20p if you had forgot your own, you can it it from reception. A good quantity of cubicles for showers and toilets as well so there's no waiting to get in one to use it which was great. This camp site has its own washing up stations with hot water just remember to bring your own washing up liquid and scrubber. Cash on arrival there was no option for electronic payments. £30 a night which I think is the going rate for a campsite with amenities and a £10 deposit which you get back, then your given a number I just displayed this in my car. We were told our dog had to be on a lead at all times which I can see why so we ended up taking long walks on the beach to burn the dogs energy. The site it's self was still quite loud gone 11pm with kids and adults still having a nice time which for us was a bit difficult to go to sleep but appreciate it is the summer holidays. The water station in the field worked but the drainage underneath was blocked, and the hand sanitiser station was open with dead flies in - see pictures. The staff seemed friendly enough gave us directs to the beach which was about a 10 minute walk away. This was two minutes in the car but it will cost you £6 to park up in the beach car park. Beautiful views to be seen all round and some great little walks. The beach was lovely and clean and lots of space to relax for the day. As camp sites go this one was good just minor issues.",

There's always plates stacked against it which you have to move before you can start your workout. The staff are lovely and always say hello, they are very approachable. But I just wish they'd have someone go around the gym and tidy it up before someone hurts themselves. I saw a kid drop a 20kg plate on his bare toes last week!!

Now he has Zoe and he's all of sudden been crying not wanting to go to his lesson. Very out of character for him. He's always loved going. But tonight I witnessed why he doesn't want to go. The way she treated him and other children in his class was appalling. When the lesson was over she wanted to speak to me to tell me that Theo was very distracted by me standing by the window watching him! Baring in mind she got my husband to go and stand by the window the week before because my son was crying. She spoke to me like something she had trodden in and humiliated me in front of 20 other parents when I said to her about the way she was speaking to me and my child she told me if I don't like it then don't come back or change his lesson! Needless to say I've made a formal complaint and even other parents came over to see I was Ok and confirmed what I was saying is what had happen! He's now moved groups thank god.",

Now he has Zoe and he's all of sudden been crying not wanting to go to his lesson. Very out of character for him. He's always loved going. But tonight I witnessed why he doesn't want to go. The way she treated him and other children in his class was appalling. When the lesson was over she wanted to speak to me to tell me that Theo was very distracted by me standing by the window watching him! Baring in mind she got my husband to go and stand by the window the week before because my son was crying. She spoke to me like something she had trodden in and humiliated me in front of 20 other parents when I said to her about the way she was speaking to me and my child she told me if I don't like it then don't come back or change his lesson! Needless to say I've made a formal complaint and even other parents came over to see I was Ok and confirmed what I was saying is what had happen! He's now moved groups thank god.",

The changing rooms are small, with only a few larger changing areas. The lockers are the old style £1/charity ones you can get, refundable of course. The changing area is hot so be prepared!\nThe viewing area isn't too good as I'd say it's a large double window and only a few can watch their children going through their routines. There's a water fountain, a drinks and vending machine in the waiting area. The centre looks to be popular with dance classes, gym and other sports centre activities going on, though I'm only there for the swimming lessons. There's parking a little way from the entrance but you may need to cross a road (if using the parking near the play area out front). There's also parking at the side, which is a two minute walk and where some of the teachers park.",

However, I had come in today with my partner asking about my membership card, which we had lost and then found again in the upstairs of the gym. We had reported it the day of losing it (yesterday), but had come back today to get it reissued as my partner had found it by going back in the gym with his membership card (we have two as we have a joint ‘couples’ account). The lady at the desk had no consideration for our situation at all, asking us how we could have lost it if we had another card (she clearly didn’t realise we had two). She treated us like we lacked common knowledge, and told us there is a charge to losing our card (which we had absolutely no issue with) and then proceeded to speak to us like children and told us she can’t keep reissuing cards if we’re going to lose them and then find them again. She then cancelled both of our membership cards despite the fact that we had only lost one, and when she realised this she became even more irate realising she now had to reissue 2 cards instead of one, through her own error. The lack of empathy she had for the situation was appalling, as we have never lost either of our membership cards up until this point and have been using the gym since January of this year. She consistently raised her tone and spoke in a sarcastic way whilst my partner and I spoke in a normal, calm and friendly tone despite the way we were being treated. After trying to explain ourselves after being constantly being talked down to and interrupted, my partner finally had enough and we gave both cards back and left. I am overall disgusted at this encounter as we have never had any issues with any of the staff before, they are lovely, friendly and always generous with their help. However, after today, we will be cancelling our memberships and putting our money elsewhere.\nOverall, the gym facilities are fantastic, but if you lose your card don’t bother trying to get it reissued.",

I feel there should be at least one person constantly to monitor for emergencies and for help if needed, or just a friendly face to welcome you.\n\nWhen you come in, there is a separate area before the gym itself which could be improved. There are always giant black bags full to the brim of rubbish, and are put right next to the seating area. There is a fridge for an optional free bottle of water, but is hardly ever stocked. I would also like to suggest better seats to replace the hard metal ones.\n\nOnce you go through, it's the opposite issue for rubbish,  where the only bin is on the main floor. You often see empty bottles and used tissues in the changing room. This does not affect the showers themselves as they are always maintained well.\n\nOn the main floor, the equipment itself is clean, but as someone wary of germs, I would kindly recommend more antibacterial spray for members to wipe down before and after using the machines. My past few visits the bottle was empty.\n\nOverall this is a nice place to workout, with a good selection of classes if you are into that.

And there is a good selection of classes.\n\nSadly ive cancelled my membership with effect from the end of the 12 month contract and will be going elsewhere. Yes it's more money but at least the pool will be warm and the facilities clean.\n\nI hope that they conduct a deep clean and fix the broken items, but I don't think they will.",

Full of machines that look like medieval torture devices? But Everlast Gym in Newport completely smashed our expectations. This place is so well-equipped, spacious, and welcoming that we briefly considered relocating just to make it our regular spot.\n\nThe Gym Floor 🏋️‍♂️\n\nFirst off, it’s huge. There’s plenty of space, meaning no awkward hovering around waiting for a bench or a machine to free up. Cardio, weights, functional training areas—it’s all here, and everything is modern, clean, and well-maintained. The layout is smart, so you’re not tripping over people mid-battle-rope session or feeling like you’re lifting weights in someone’s personal space bubble.\n\nThe Classes 🚴‍♀️🔥\n\nWe didn’t take a class, but judging by the energy coming from the spin studio, those people were definitely working harder than we were. The timetable looked brilliant, with HIIT, circuits, spin, and yoga, perfect whether you want to push yourself to the limit or just stretch out after a long road trip.\n\nThe Pool, Steam Room & Sauna 🌊🔥\n\nLet’s be honest—this was a massive bonus. After a proper workout, being able to cool down in the pool and then sweat it out in the sauna felt like luxury. The steam room was spotless, and it turns out there’s nothing better than sitting in a sauna pretending you’re a pro athlete in recovery.\n\nThe Staff & Atmosphere 👏\n\nThe team here is fantastic—friendly, helpful, and genuinely welcoming, which is a big deal when you’re visiting a gym for the first time. No intimidating “regulars only” vibes—just a great, inclusive atmosphere that makes you want to come back.\n\nThe Verdict ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nIf we lived in Newport, Everlast would be our go-to gym, no question. It’s got everything you need, a brilliant layout, and a great mix of serious fitness and relaxation. Whether you’re lifting, swimming, spinning, or just enjoying the sauna more than you probably should, this place is a winner.\n\nFive stars—plus an extra one for the sauna, because it made us feel like fitness royalty.",

They have a video playing over the bath to show water effects and people swimming (see my videos posted with the review). Looks okay, but could have been so much better with better effects, scaled more human like people, they were about 9 feet tall and had odd body shapes, etc. The wall board says men and women never bathed together and then you turn around and the image of 2 people swimming in the bath is a man and woman. Again, the info wasn’t presented well. Also the staff weren’t great. They were friendly enough but didn’t seem to know much about it and didn’t seem to want to actually talk to anyone.\n\nThere was an interesting cavern under the pools that was the old drain from the pools. There is water in it today, probably ground water seeping through. The main water for the baths came from 5 miles away, amazing the work they put into the baths.\n\nThe other thing that is super neat but not explained well is the heating for the hot room. It had a raised floor and they somehow used the hot air and smoke from a fire to funnel through under the floor and heat the room. Pretty amazing those Romans!",

The steam room was tepid (a regular told me there is no point in complaining as nothing changes), there is no cold water - not even a cold shower, to cool off (fundamental & inexpensive). I was forced to visit the very grubby outside smoking area to cool off. There is no drinking water dispenser, insufficient toilets (despite having the space), insufficient towel hooks and no signage. The main issue though is inadequate core facilities - sauna, steam, jacuzzi given the number of punters. They have the space to add more, and at £20 a visit, they certainly have the funds. Punters travel long distances as it's the only one around. They deserve better. If it wasn't for our primeval need for sex, this place would have closed a long time ago.

When I asked for it, they kindly made a lovely cheese omelette with peppers.\n\nDinner menu was great, although my experience on 2 evenings was not the best I've had. The chicken wings was one of the worst I've had. They were full fried, dry and fibery. I would've wanted them succulent and falling off the bone. Also the side vegetable salad was nothing but overcooked veggies like broccoli, carrots and cauliflower. Bad selection from me, so won't try this next time.\n\nNext evening I got the pulled pork pizza. Thick crust and freshly made one. Was really good, could've been a bit spicier. Will try other pizzas next time.\n\nI stayed for 3 nights. Pleasant experience and definitely lovely customer service.",

They are by far the friendliest and most helpful managers of a site we have been to. They care about the site and you can see from the manicured lawns, painted fences and clean facilities.

It you were not brave (or patient) enough for cooking on a flame you could use the cheats kitchen. Inside the Cheats Kitchen sits the pantry and you could spend a little fortune there on fresh produce that was really tasty!\nThe shower block was clean, warm and good showers.\n\nWe attended the Lambing Live and had the BEST experience with assisting a delivery - I am not suggesting this is a common event as you never can tell with Nature but Helen Hearn was informative and answered every question with gusto and positivity. Feeding the orphan lambs was great fun too!\n\nI would go back to Penhein again and shout it from the rooftops - go if you want a little adventure!",

We fed the lambs, took them and their mother Ewe out to the fields and counted them in the fields to check non had been separated. £35 for a full morning of fun that we all enjoyed - an absolute bargain. The site was beautiful, incredibly clean and peaceful. Everything from start to finish was perfect, and we are already planning our return trip. So much space, wildlife and despite the April showers we were able to stay warm and cook outdoors thanks to the abundance of free fire wood. The cheats kitchen very handy though! Our children loved being able to choose an ice cream from the freezer (delicious btw) and we could of happily spent our entire trip at the farm.
