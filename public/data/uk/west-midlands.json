I was spoken to harshly, pushed out before I could even rinse off properly, and made to feel unwelcome. It felt like I was being treated less than human.

Me and my partner attended a 2 hour lane swimming session and had both a parent teach her child that took up half on the space of a lane, meaning a lot of swimmers had to stop early or swim around her. They weren't lame swimming and the lifeguards were aware and didn't do anything. Later in the session there were 2 schoolchildren who had a inflatable ball and kept splashing around and getting in people's way. At one point all the other swimmers were just doing half laps to avoid the pair as they were so disruptive. It's such a shame that the lifeguards can't enforce the rules as we're all paying guests.",

I’ve made great progress and now feel confident swimming in deep water. I’ve even swum the full length of the pool with my husband during mixed sessions without any issues.\nHowever, during the women-only sessions, I’ve found the attitude of some lifeguards quite disappointing. One in particular has been rude and unreasonably strict. When I tried to explain that I feel confident swimming in the deep end, I was told that if I continued going there, I would be banned unless I took more lessons. This feels unfair and comes across as a way of pushing people to spend more money rather than supporting their progress.\nI completely understand the importance of safety, but lifeguards should also be polite, professional, and encouraging. Their role is to ensure safety — not to discourage capable swimmers who have put in the effort to learn. A more respectful and understanding approach would make the experience much better for everyone.",

All other sessions are learning and kids hang out sides. They leave a tiny lane for the ladies who actually want to lane swim and its not very pleasant as its too narrow and difficult to overtake.  Most sessions are also always completely full and it's difficult to get a slot, you have to wait for cancellations on the day. Also, they pack us like sardines which makes it worse, I remember one time 9am it was lane swimmers and there were like 5 lanes or so and was super crowded.\nI think more ladies sessions should be added as they're clearly very popular but the managers responses to the raised issued fell on deaf ears.

Dirty floors, dirty changing cubicles and clumps of hair in the shower drain. I don't understand the 'no outerwear' signs all around where 'the outer'is much cleaner than inside and who in their right mind would walk barefoot on those disgusting floors? Toilets are tired, with broken cubicle locks and dirty floor that could really use a pressure washer. Recently changed showerheads have very low water pressure and the water is either scorching hot or freezing cold, nothing in between. Hair dryers in ladies changing room either broken or removed.There's only few towel hangers, some lockers inside are truly disgusting, no benches to leave your bag while you shower and nobody thought to install some shampoo holders by showers, so you have to keep everything on the floor. As for the swimming area itself, the pool is big and deep, good for doing the lengths. They removed tables and benches recently so it doesn't look very inviting and the floor tiles again need a proper scrub. My main issue there is that there's lots of debris floating in the water, the foamy bits from the equipment and I've never seen any staff trying to fish it out.

Dirty floors, dirty changing cubicles and clumps of hair in the shower drain. I don't understand the 'no outerwear' signs all around where 'the outer'is much cleaner than inside and who in their right mind would walk barefoot on those disgusting floors? Toilets are tired, with broken cubicle locks and dirty floor that could really use a pressure washer. Recently changed showerheads have very low water pressure and the water is either scorching hot or freezing cold, nothing in between. Hair dryers in ladies changing room either broken or removed.There's only few towel hangers, some lockers inside are truly disgusting, no benches to leave your bag while you shower and nobody thought to install some shampoo holders by showers, so you have to keep everything on the floor. As for the swimming area itself, the pool is big and deep, good for doing the lengths. They removed tables and benches recently so it doesn't look very inviting and the floor tiles again need a proper scrub. My main issue there is that there's lots of debris floating in the water, the foamy bits from the equipment and I've never seen any staff trying to fish it out. I even saw a plaster floating there once!\nOn the plus side the staff are very friendly and helpful and the car park is spacious, so 2 * for this.",

There’s some tick-tock people but they haven’t caused me any issues as everyone just does their own thing.\nThey used to have a rooftop area you could workout on which was really nice in summer, but this seems to not be used now.\n\nThe cleanliness varies as some staff are really on it and other staff aren’t. Additionally there’s a longstanding issue with that women’s drainage in the bathrooms from the showers making it smell in the changing room.

The gym gets quite busy, and many people use the equipment without cleaning it afterward, which feels quite unhygienic. The locker rooms also feel old, and it’s inconvenient that you have to buy a lock from the gym instead of having a simpler system.

The water pressure for the wash basin are way to high.\nNext is the resistant facilities. I felt for a gym of this size, with the amount of gym goers even during mild period, there are not enough power racks, benches, and free weights. During peak hours, I dont even bother with any of the benches. In comparison with gyms from city centre/downtown in other parts of the world, I do not believe there are enough power racks, press benches, regular benches, free weights, etc.\n\nThos are 2 reasons I give this gym a rating of 3, which have nothing to do with COVID-19.\n\nBut with that being said, I still go to this gym due to geographical location. I just wish the building is maintain better, and the weights sections are better invested. But if you are into cardio, you probably never have to waits for any of the machines. There are like more than a hundread of cardios machines from all kinds of bikes, to tread, to steps, to row.\n\n3/5 as of 3-11-20. But good enough for me to go nevertheless.",

The treadmills that do work often have faults. When I rejoined a few months ago, the sauna was “out of order,” and I was told it would be fixed soon — six months later, it’s still out of order.\n\nWhen I’ve tried to raise these concerns with staff, I’m met with shrugs and “it is what it is.” For a gym charging £26 a month, that’s simply not acceptable. Other gyms in the same price range, like JD and PureGym, maintain much higher standards.\n\nThere are also basic facilities that have been neglected: no hairdryers for women anymore, showers that take ages to warm up (if at all), and fewer working showers due to boarded-off sections. To top it off, yesterday there was a bucket in front of the ladies’ gym to catch a leak.\n\nThe only reason I rejoined was because of the 24/7 opening hours, but at this point, convenience isn’t enough to justify the poor experience. I really hope management takes this feedback seriously and restores the gym to the standards it once had.",

Jack is not helpful at all, doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing and is just incompetent.

I was waiting for 7:15 got these and he told me that swimming was 6:30-7:30 and that it was full and I’m too late. It seems like he deliberately told me to come when swimming was finished to waste my time.\n\nI wasted 2 hours waiting from 4pm when I could have came earlier. Jack is not helpful at all, doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing and is just incompetent.

The cleanliness was non existent as it was icky and sticky. No showers before nor after which added to the 3rd world feel.\n\nThe private cubicles were the best thing about it. I wouldn't say shut this place down, just burn it to the ground and from the watery ashes, build a better swimming bath.",

First two times we've been there wasn't so busy, the third time it got way busier because kids started the Summer holidays, so it was a little bit of wait in the queue, but no more than maybe 10 minutes. We did booked the tickets in advance always. There's a café restaurant there as well where you can buy food.

When our kids were ready to progress to next stage, we had to keep asking almost every week to check the availability of lessons. When eventually there was availability, the manager again booked the wrong stage! Parents have to re-enrol children every term and we were not fully informed when re-enrolment was due. The notice up at the front desk with the weeks for re-enrolment were no good for parents going through the back of the pool. Lack of communication from the management team caused a lot of hassles unless parents keep things on top. The pool needs refurbishment and more shower facilities.",

When we arrived the receptionist offered for us to upgrade our massage to deep tissue and add more time for a fair price so I did that and I was happy with that. The atmosphere and decor is not luxurious but is pleasant nonetheless. I really enjoyed my massage I think the masseuse's name was January? If I heard correctly. She did a lovely massage one of the best I've had great deep pressure. I would say it should be more clear where to get food from, but that wasn't a problem for us as we brought sandwiches with us. There was a hot drink machine which was nice. I enjoyed the gym there was a great boxing area there good for releasing rage but I did have to ask about where the boxing gloves were as they were in a different room. The relaxation lounge was lovely the water beds were nice and comfy I could have had a nap!   It would have been good for the receptionist to state the different facilities at the start of the spa day so we were informed of all the areas, however it was OK because we went on a mooch around the place and found our own way around. In general it was a clean and tidy place I would say the bathroom sinks need a bit more cleaning around the rims and the changing room floors and walls need a little more attention but in general it was clean enough. It was a bit hard to find the showers after using the spa as they just look like changing rooms someone had to show us. So be aware of that. We didn't go in the pool as it wasn't warm enough but that might be influenced because we were warm from the steam room and hot tub. We enjoyed the hot tub bubbles although sometimes the bubbles took a while to come on. The steam room was very good for working as a decongestant and good for asthmatic cough and chestiness clearing the chest afterwards. Very hot in there could only do 5 minutes at a time. There was only 2 elemis testers on display which was a downfall. My friend and I were disappointed because when we opened them they were Completely empty and no sign that there was cream in them it was completely clean. We mentioned this to the receptionist who said we should have said something earlier as they are supposed to have cream in them. But didn't explain why they were empty so I am still baffled as to why they were empty. As I was very excited to do testers so I was disappointed. But other than that we did have a lovely day and a relaxing day. The highlights were the massage, the gym, the relaxation lounge room and the steam room. All in all a nice place and had a lovely day. There are more fancy spas out there that I've been to but this one was close by and affordable and pleasant. So we did have a lovely spa day.",

It would have been more better if there was more equipment in the women’s only section, however its still nice especially during less busy hours when people aren’t queuing up behind machine’s instead of asking how long you have left. Toilets and changing rooms are normally clean however a few times there has been no toilet roll and mess near the sink. I haven’t joined a class yet at this gym only other pure gyms so I can’t really comment on this. But it would be good if Zumba/legs bums & tums were available in the afternoons instead of just the evenings. Also the pin entry on the ground floor can be quite frustrating sometimes when the doors aren’t opening properly, this has happened many times with and without myself carrying bags. There was a lovely lady a pt who helped me get through the doors last time a few months ago which helped. Overall even though this gym is far from my house and my work, this gym is great & worth traveling to!",

The trainers are always willing to help and offer advice. I’ve worked with Adrian and he’s absolutely wonderful.

Not seen since Glasgow 1994. Parking was ok, large yard, well organised if you don't get boxed in, the toilets and shower were like Cub Camp 1978. If you have a less than clean toilet area at least invest 30p in each cubicle so there is a hook to keep stuff off the floor - 2 stars. Restaurant - 0 stars. When you have a lorry park, rammed for the evening @ £24 each, surely a quality breakfast is a possibility - filter coffee or espresso? Just because there is a lot on the plate doesn't make it good. Very few in for breakfast, it would be busier if the breakfast was better.  I sometimes wish that the owners of these places would take a trip to mainland Europe to see what a truckers restaurant is supposed to be like in this day and age. I try to support smaller establishments rather than give money to Moto etc but please help make our job a little more comfortable when away from family home for the week!  Thanks",

The mushrooms chicken was not cooked enough, I didn’t send it back because it was impossible to do anything about it after that and I didn’t want to find some ‘spices’ added. They couldn’t provide me the bank card receipt which I needed. And the showers are good, but they should have start/stop buton, especially for women, 7-8 minutes it is not enough, or at least it should play the sound one minute before ending, not when the water stops so we are able to rinse.",

First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

I also appreciated the thoughtful amenities, including  Costa Coffee and high-speed Wi-Fi that made it easy to relax or get some work done. The bathroom was spacious, with plush towels and a rain shower that felt like a luxurious spa experience.\n\nThe hotel’s location was ideal—convenient to restaurants, shops, and attractions, yet tucked away enough to provide a peaceful retreat. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, always ensuring that my stay was enjoyable.\n\nOverall, this hotel room was definitely worth the price. It provided comfort, convenience, and excellent service—everything you could ask for in a great stay. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway or a business trip with a touch of luxury!",

Lovely site set in woodland, the facilities are exceptionally clean and modern with proper showers rather than push button showers, I didn't have to wait to use the shower and toilet facilities once, which considering the site was very well occupied was brilliant.\nWe saw the members of staff around all day cleaning and tidying as they went, even outside of the shower and toilet facilities cleaning times they were in there mopping the floor and doing the things other guests didn’t do to keep it nice and clean. All 3 members of staff we saw and spoke to were very polite, very helpful and well presented in their uniform.\nThe metered electric worked very well, the link you get sent via text message shows exactly how much you have left and it also sends a message when you're running low, topping up was very simple. I saw some people complaining about metered electric on Facebook, however I think it is the only way to stop people from taking advantage of non metered electric and running high draw devices all day and night, ultimately they are a business so why should they pay for your air-conditioning and awning heaters, this could easily cost more than the entire site fee for one night. They give you £2 a day which is very fair, and I'm sure most people will find that sufficient. We used a little bit more than that as we had the heating on a lot, until we get the refund from our unused credit I don't know exactly what it cost, but probably no more than £10 extra for the 5 nights.\nAccess to the site is very easy with no narrow lanes to navigate down, and a simple to use keypad to operate the electric gate for entry and exit.\nThere were a few occasions the airport noise got annoying if the wind was blowing the wrong way, but hey, you can't expect to stay 8 miles from an airport and not hear planes some of the time! This doesn't detract from what is an absolutely beautiful site and as mentioned has the best facilities we have found on a site.",

Showers are free and there is plenty of hot water. There is a pub, The Case is Altered, just 20 minutes walk up the road, which doesn’t offer food.

This is the perfect holiday if you want to feel the benefits of being surrounded by nature and taking things easy. Our children are always happiest when allowed freedom to explore in the great outdoors and Cannock Chase is situated just across the road from Silver trees making it the perfect base to explore.\nThe park is immaculate and since our last visit the site has undergone improvements including the newly renovated swimming pool which features Bluetooth speakers so you can listen to your favourite music while you have a swim, the pool area and the water is always nice and warm.\nAll of the caravans have fantastic views over the nature reserve where you can sit and watch the deer. Our children also like feeding them with the deer food available to buy from reception. This was our second time staying at Silver trees and we have stayed in both Blackberry and Elderberry caravans which are both great however we have already booked to return next year and are looking forward to staying in new accommodation called Buck view lodge. This lodge is brand new and will offer incredible views from it's own private decking right up towards the ridge of the nature reserve where we will be able to watch the stags rutting. I can't think of anywhere else this unique and beautiful.\nThank you all again for another amazing break and we can't wait to see you again next year if not before.\nKind regards\nAkers family",

We holidayed as a family of four, myself, my husband and our two sons aged 7 and 3. My boys are fascinated by the deer and loved being able to get close and even feed them at times. The site is clean and well cared for, the caravans we have stayed in are spotless, the first year we stayed in Blackberry which has incredible views over the ridge, we stayed during rutting season and it's fascinating to watch the stags. This year we stayed in Elderberry which is a beautiful caravan with equally great views.\nWe have also just booked to come again next year and we are going to be in the brand new Buck lodge, an addition to the current lodges already there with front and side decking to enjoy the views and watch the deer.\nThe staff are fantastic, really friendly and helpful and we enjoyed chatting to them when we popped into reception everyday!\nThe facilities on site are great, a fantastic swimming pool which you book for your family's own private hire for the hour, it's very clean and lovely and warm. We also enjoyed the tennis court this year, rackets and balls are provided free of charge which was fab!\nThe site is a short walk from Cannock chase and the woodland walks are just wonderful.\nSilver trees is a real gem, and we just love coming here.",

The party room was a good size and we were allowed in beforehand to set up decorations and party bags etc. The staff were kind enough to help us deflate the twenty inflatables we’d brought and Saab even helped my husband carry things back to the car.

The management is a joke — constantly making excuses, blaming “parts from Germany” that somehow take months to arrive, while members keep paying for broken facilities.\n\nHygiene is terrible. On my last visit, they claimed the spa was closed for a “deep clean,” yet there was hair all over the steam room floor. I sat in there for 45 minutes and not a single staff member checked the area — a complete failure of health and safety.\n\nOn a Bank Holiday (when the pool and spa have always been open in the past), everything was shut. When I asked why, the staff couldn’t give a straight answer. It just comes across as lazy and careless.\n\nCentre AT7 used to be a great place, but the current management clearly don’t care about the members. They’re happy to take your money but won’t deliver even the basics — working facilities, proper cleaning, or decent customer service.\n\nUnless things improve drastically, I won’t be recommending this place to anyone.",

It smelt like wee the second you open the door to the changing rooms and it was like that all throughout, (men’s, women’s & mixed - husband came as well).

It was clear the area had not been cleaned for some time.\nIn the pool, only three-quarters of the space was available due to lessons taking place, yet I was still charged the full admission price.

There is a great bunch of regular people who use the club who are very down to earth.\n\nNow, where to start...\n\nHead office really need to revamp the facilities from top to bottom. In need of some serious investment and judging by the previous comments many years ago seems things have not changed till date which is disappointing . Jacuzzi has not been working for months which is a eyesore every time you enter the pool area with still no confirmed date for repair. Steam room seems to always need repair once a month (not working again now and not sure when this will be working again, been more than a week already). Maybe this is a business move from head office with energy costs going up? Could really do with more seating area in the pool area, with only 1 table and 3/4 chairs would be nice to have more dotted around.\n\nGym area again is very outdated. Some of the pads on the machines are damaged which have not been replaced. This does cause a few grazes and discomfort when lifting weights and obviously you cannot sanitize the area properly. Windows seem like they have not been cleaned in years and it would be lovely to have a TV playing like typical gyms but unfortunately this is a no go. Funnily enough there is a sign by the water machine saying that we are moving away from using plastic cups to be more environmentally friendly. Surprisingly there has always been plastic cups there when i have looked when requiring hydration !! Health and safety wise the fire exit door has rope/ plastic bollards in the way to prevent people entering leaving this way when the door is left open when its hot. Pretty sure fire exits meant to be kept clear from all obstacles?\n\nFor those attending don't forget to bring a padlock for the outdated lockers (a lot of lockers are broken) rather than a pound like typical leisure clubs. Hygiene wise there is ample mould in the men's shower areas which personally i find disgusting and surprised this has not been addressed.\n\nSpindles after years and years of neglect its about time you invested in your facilities. Someone from higher management needs to come and see for themselves what its like here and make changes. Great bunch of people working here but you can obviously see there disappointment and tired faces every time people ask when will this be repaired. Spindles, help out you staff and please make this place better.",

Park was really quiet hardly any queues (less than 4 people infront of you for every slide!) which was really good! The baby park downstairs is in completely the wrong place, it’s feezing cold for any young ones or babies due to the draft coming through the changing rooms. Our baby was shivering when we went down there, so we couldn’t stay. The water also isn’t the warmest, and the air is also quite cold when you’re not in the water. The slides looked really good, the lazy river is a little bit small & the wave pool is tiny. The circle shape of the building is good but really annoying when you’ve done a few laps of the building to get to slides. They could do with some rubber matting because it’s really slippery even when walking round. Staff are all quite young, but very friendly and looked to be on the ball with safety. Overall it wasn’t too bad, more suitable for kids 10-16 than any other age. & wish it was a bit warmer!",

Changing facilities were clean but so many broken lockers and cubicle doors. Won’t be returning.",

There doesn't seem to be any parking however, at the time of our visit there was a few cars parked outside the doors sneaked through barriers (which doesn't seem to be designated spaces) and others parked around the outside on pavements and double yellows which I was also forced to do. Also unfortunately there isn't a viewing gallery to watch the kids as they swim. They do have a waiting/cafe area as you walk in but the swimming pool is not visible at all unless you are swimming. so bear that in mind if you are hoping to let the kids swim while you watch.",

We got let in after the lady checked the confirmation email rather than using the QR code. The wristbands worked fine with the lockers and the changing rooms were nice and clean. We were then held at a rope for about 10 minutes before being let in.\n\nThere were 5 slides active with one out of action long-term at the moment, very disappointing. It quickly became obvious how much queuing we were going to be doing. In the 2 hours we were there I think we got 6 rides which is ridiculous. The lazy river and wave pool were OK but nothing you can't go to at many other pools.\n\nThe staff at the slides were pretty miserable and more interested in chatting and having a laugh with each other. I tried to joke with some of them, get a smile at least, but none seemed interested. I get it, the job is pretty tedious, holding people until the green light and, in the case of the inflatable slides, pushing people off, but still!\n\nOh and I slipped down the stairs getting off one of the rides, which has bruised my back and feet! I never understand pools having such slippery walking surfaces\n\nOverall, the kids generally enjoyed it but they've said they're not bothered about going again. 2 hours sounded like a lot of time but it was FAR too busy, FAR too many people. 6 rides in 2 hours was ridiculous, especially for paying just over £50 for the three of us (13 year old is considered an adult, ridiculous!!). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as I felt it's overpriced for what it is. Oh and then we wanted a drink and something to eat coming out but the cafe looked empty of food and staff so we went over the road to a mini supermarket instead",

If someone were to fall or injure themselves because of this, it could easily lead to legal action. Safety should be taken seriously. If someone is strong enough to lift the weights to use them, there’s no excuse for not racking them properly afterward.\n\nI also can’t stand how some people have no respect for personal space or hygiene—including groups of students and Uber drivers who seem more interested in staring at women than actually training.\n\nI understand people need to rest between sets, but it’s frustrating when they take 10 minutes just staring at their phones or having long conversations, with no regard for others waiting to use the machine.\n\nOn top of that, some of the equipment is badly in need of maintenance or replacement. For example, one of the calf raise machines feels like the bearings are shot, and the loading pole on the leg press is so angled it looks like the plates could fall off at any moment.\n\nOverall, the entire branch feels neglected and seems to be relying solely on the JD Gyms name to keep attracting members.

Gym goers want to get in, do their workout and go home/to work, so I end up skipping machines I wanted to use or working out another muscle group I hadn't planned to. Even treadmills are all taken up sometimes so getting a warmup in using them isn't a guarantee at busy times. If a group are working out together then you can basically kiss goodbye to being able to use whatever machines they're taking up. It's a shame and eventually I may have to switch gyms. Also the showers are weird with frosted glass and huge gaps under the doors. Not great for those who value privacy.",

Neither the flavoured nor the regular water fountain works, there aren’t nearly enough paper towels or cleaning stations, and there aren’t enough plates. On top of that, the women’s workout space they advertise is closed. The place itself is filthy — rubbish left on the floors, sweat on the seats, and the whole gym stinks. Unless you plan to work out at 3am, don’t bother.\n\nEDIT: Increasing the rating to 2 starts, as the women’s only section just opened and it’s actually very nice, tidy, and usable. Unfortunately the rest of the review still stands.",

This one however is by far the worst. Very very small inside, absolutely 0 control on the number of people inside so was swarmed by large groups of 12-14 year old lads messing around. The changing rooms were equally as small. With it being a new pure gym I was expecting it to be fairly good, but they hadn’t even taken time to clean off the greasy manufacturers coating on the dumbbells or plates nearly resulting in a nice “50” imprint on my face. Long story short unless you are beyond desperate i wouldn’t bother, there’s many other in the area that are great",

You will expect them from such an expensive accommodation but apparently not.\n\nWhat finally drove me to write this review is that fact that there is no hot water in shower for the past 4 days now, which is unacceptable in such a freezing weather.",

          "reviewText": "⭐ Highly Recommended – Sky Blue Point, Coventry\n\nI recently moved into Sky Blue Point, Coventry, and I wanted to leave a review for anyone who may be looking for an en-suite room, whether you are a student, foundation student, or a working professional.\n\nFrom the moment I moved in, my experience has been very positive. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting the manager, Gemma, who is extremely friendly, approachable, and always goes above and beyond to help with any questions or issues. She genuinely makes you feel supported. The reception team, Rachel and Amis, are also fantastic—very welcoming, helpful, and professional.\n\nThe room itself is great and well-equipped. It includes an en-suite bathroom, a comfortable bed, wardrobe and cupboards, and a study desk, which is perfect for studying or working from home.\n\nOne of the standout features of this accommodation is the strong focus on safety. There is 24/7 on-site security as well as CCTV cameras installed throughout the building and around the property, which really gives peace of mind. The security staff are always available, day or night, and are very helpful if you need assistance or have any questions.\n\nThe property also offers parking facilities, including disabled parking, as well as bike racks outside with metal frames where you can securely lock your bike.\n\nAll the facilities are clean, modern, and well maintained. There is a 24/7 on-site gym, a common room where you can relax and watch TV, a quiet study room, and a small entertainment room downstairs. There is also a laundry facility on-site, which is very convenient—you can wash your clothes whenever it suits you.\n\nThe accommodation includes a shared kitchen, usually shared between 6–7 tenants, which is spacious and works well.\n\nAnother great benefit is the broadband internet available throughout the building. This makes things very convenient, especially if you have poor phone network or no signal at times—you can always rely on the Wi-Fi, which works really well.\n\nThe location is excellent. Coventry University is only a five-minute walk away, and there are shops, restaurants, and takeaways nearby, making everyday life very convenient.\n\nOverall, I’m genuinely very happy with my stay so far. The staff are incredibly friendly and always willing to help, the facilities are excellent, and the atmosphere is welcoming. I would highly recommend Sky Blue Point to anyone looking for quality accommodation in Coventry. I honestly couldn’t ask for more.",

          "reviewText": "⭐ Highly Recommended – Sky Blue Point, Coventry\n\nI recently moved into Sky Blue Point, Coventry, and I wanted to leave a review for anyone who may be looking for an en-suite room, whether you are a student, foundation student, or a working professional.\n\nFrom the moment I moved in, my experience has been very positive. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting the manager, Gemma, who is extremely friendly, approachable, and always goes above and beyond to help with any questions or issues. She genuinely makes you feel supported. The reception team, Rachel and Amis, are also fantastic—very welcoming, helpful, and professional.\n\nThe room itself is great and well-equipped. It includes an en-suite bathroom, a comfortable bed, wardrobe and cupboards, and a study desk, which is perfect for studying or working from home.\n\nOne of the standout features of this accommodation is the strong focus on safety. There is 24/7 on-site security as well as CCTV cameras installed throughout the building and around the property, which really gives peace of mind. The security staff are always available, day or night, and are very helpful if you need assistance or have any questions.\n\nThe property also offers parking facilities, including disabled parking, as well as bike racks outside with metal frames where you can securely lock your bike.\n\nAll the facilities are clean, modern, and well maintained. There is a 24/7 on-site gym, a common room where you can relax and watch TV, a quiet study room, and a small entertainment room downstairs. There is also a laundry facility on-site, which is very convenient—you can wash your clothes whenever it suits you.\n\nThe accommodation includes a shared kitchen, usually shared between 6–7 tenants, which is spacious and works well.\n\nAnother great benefit is the broadband internet available throughout the building. This makes things very convenient, especially if you have poor phone network or no signal at times—you can always rely on the Wi-Fi, which works really well.\n\nThe location is excellent. Coventry University is only a five-minute walk away, and there are shops, restaurants, and takeaways nearby, making everyday life very convenient.\n\nOverall, I’m genuinely very happy with my stay so far. The staff are incredibly friendly and always willing to help, the facilities are excellent, and the atmosphere is welcoming. I would highly recommend Sky Blue Point to anyone looking for quality accommodation in Coventry. I honestly couldn’t ask for more.",

If you are someone who prefers privacy (like me) go for their deluxe studio rooms, mine was on the second floor so if ever the elevators were not working I didn’t have to struggle at all.\n\nThe laundry service requires money obviously lol, I think I spent £2,50 for washer and dryer per load. Make sure you download the app and check machines are working before selecting one (refunds can take long).\n\nMaintenance comes by periodically throughout the year to make sure certain things are still maintained. If you have any issues report them to reception. Also make sure you move in at a time where reception is still open because if there are any problems security can’t really assist much.\n\nI think you are allowed a maximum of two visitors at a time if I’m not wrong and if you have visitors sleeping over there is a form you have to fill out.\n\nTesco Express is literally at your door step, the bus station and Sainsbury’s are about a street away. There is a Puregym opposite the the building for all the fitness bunnies. The canal route is literally on the other side of the building, you have to climb up the stairs and you’ll be there.\n\nThere is also a shop (Delta Supermarket) around the corner that sells all your African necessities Iwisa, Robertsons spices etc.",

The staff are extremely friendly and many of the visitors are regular and repeat campers and we can see why. It's far enough away from major towns to be rural and peaceful but close enough if you want to explore. The site is well maintained with a dog walking area, ball park, games room and a 9 hole putting green. There is also a fishing pond which was very popular with visitors. The toilet/shower blocks were always kept clean and tidy. There is a small shop onsite to get any basics you need to stock up on along with a few extras such as toys etc. Back to the XL Bully point for those who may be put off...from what I understand it's not necessarily a blanket policy. If you abide by the rules and your dog is well behaved, as we do and ours is, you will be allowed to stay but if you flout the rules or your dog causes issues you will be asked to leave and as an XL owner I think that's a very fair and balanced view to take. She doesn't often get the chance to socialise because people walk the other way but so many visitors stopped to ask if they could fuss her, which was fantastic for her development. We will definitely be returning, with or without the dogs.",

They have 3 separate fields, one for families, one for relaxing and one for social gatherings. The atmosphere on the social field was awesome, everyone chatting and having a good time. The music cut off was 2am on that field which everyone stuck to. The field is spacious and this is one of the few places that doesn't charge per tent which is perfect for groups with multiple tents.\n\nThere are plenty of portaloos on the field which were kept clean and staff came to check everyone was having a good time throughout the night. The farm shop on site was really good, the meat was awesome and they also sell fire wood too. And there's a toilet and shower block by the ship. The only reason I couldn't give this place a 5* is the toilet/shower blocks were a little worn and not great, our group skipped using the shower for the night however it didn't put a dampener on the day in any way.\n\nLove this place and would come again",

I would love to give it -10 stars.\nFirst check in is at 3pm i checked in at 4 on sunday,i felt the receptionist had a bad day or tired of this job.no smile no greetings nothing.i have read quite alot of reviews i read kids got activity packs.my 2 kids were given nothing.and she told me to pay i put my card in it wasnt reading my card she just ignored me for 2 mins.i asked her what time does the pool close she lied and said 6.\nWhen i got my key she didnt tell me properly where to go she just mumbled.\nNo lift !!!\nStairs dirty mop bucket left on staires saw a pepsi empty can on stairs.\nRoom could be much better tiny bathroom with shower no bath tub booked the same room holiday inn near the airport good size bathroom with bathtub and a small fridge.\nNo fridge no coffee machine pillows outdated mattreses outdated.\nAnyway was told 6pm the pool closes just thinking i have 1 hour to swim i went to find the swimming pool.couldnt find it asked receptionist she was rued and didnt instruct properly.was finding it for 15 mins.\nI asked regural customers i was told it closes at 8.\nSwimming pool not a good size especialy with alot of guests.\nNext day had breakfast chef aswell no smile no welcoming when i asked him something no smile nothing  and went to swim after enjoying swimming for a little while they started taking more then half of the pool for fitness classes.and give us a tiny bit we agreed and was still happy.\nBut the lady there came up to me and told me you are not swimming you have to swim or get out for 45mins.\nI said what!! I am swimming she said no ur playing about if you want to stay u swim round and round.the man aswell kept on telling me to get out.\nI said theres other people and kids there just standing around go tell them aswell she said yeah im going and she didnt she lied and ran away.was that racism ?\nI got so angry after all that i just got out the pool and went to get ready took my daughter out.she wanted 2 swim more\nCheck out was at 11 i had packed all my stuff already so i can swim and took it down with me 10.30 i remembered i forgot something went back room was already clean.how ??\nCan u clean a room before check out time ?\nIts not allowed.iv worked in ibis i know how it works.\n11 is my check out thats still my room mybe i wanted to go back 2 shower or anything?\nThats just out of the question to clean a room before check out.\nIm sorry to say train your staff or change your staff!!!\nTo smile to greet to be helpfull its not only me iv seen alot of bad reviews of your staff.\nStaff are getting payed to make our stay happy and comfortable.\nUnhappy staff = unhappy customer.\nAnd if u want to go on with fitness clubs you do a time 4 them so they are not distracted and we can swim bec we have all payed.or make another private swimming pool.\nI heard 2 ladies really complaining paying alot of money for the club and lots of men looking at them and to much noise e.t.c\nIf anyone reads this il recommend you to go birm holiday inn near the airport.\nFreindly staff , lift ,clean stairs , big room and bathroom ,bathtub ,fridge ,coffee machine,big swimming pool,very clean hotel,the hotel is much appealing to look at.\nI really enjoyed my stay there and they even have a car to pick you.",

I would love to give it -10 stars.\nFirst check in is at 3pm i checked in at 4 on sunday,i felt the receptionist had a bad day or tired of this job.no smile no greetings nothing.i have read quite alot of reviews i read kids got activity packs.my 2 kids were given nothing.and she told me to pay i put my card in it wasnt reading my card she just ignored me for 2 mins.i asked her what time does the pool close she lied and said 6.\nWhen i got my key she didnt tell me properly where to go she just mumbled.\nNo lift !!!\nStairs dirty mop bucket left on staires saw a pepsi empty can on stairs.\nRoom could be much better tiny bathroom with shower no bath tub booked the same room holiday inn near the airport good size bathroom with bathtub and a small fridge.\nNo fridge no coffee machine pillows outdated mattreses outdated.\nAnyway was told 6pm the pool closes just thinking i have 1 hour to swim i went to find the swimming pool.couldnt find it asked receptionist she was rued and didnt instruct properly.was finding it for 15 mins.\nI asked regural customers i was told it closes at 8.\nSwimming pool not a good size especialy with alot of guests.\nNext day had breakfast chef aswell no smile no welcoming when i asked him something no smile nothing  and went to swim after enjoying swimming for a little while they started taking more then half of the pool for fitness classes.and give us a tiny bit we agreed and was still happy.\nBut the lady there came up to me and told me you are not swimming you have to swim or get out for 45mins.\nI said what!! I am swimming she said no ur playing about if you want to stay u swim round and round.the man aswell kept on telling me to get out.\nI said theres other people and kids there just standing around go tell them aswell she said yeah im going and she didnt she lied and ran away.was that racism ?\nI got so angry after all that i just got out the pool and went to get ready took my daughter out.she wanted 2 swim more\nCheck out was at 11 i had packed all my stuff already so i can swim and took it down with me 10.30 i remembered i forgot something went back room was already clean.how ??\nCan u clean a room before check out time ?\nIts not allowed.iv worked in ibis i know how it works.\n11 is my check out thats still my room mybe i wanted to go back 2 shower or anything?\nThats just out of the question to clean a room before check out.\nIm sorry to say train your staff or change your staff!!!\nTo smile to greet to be helpfull its not only me iv seen alot of bad reviews of your staff.\nStaff are getting payed to make our stay happy and comfortable.\nUnhappy staff = unhappy customer.\nAnd if u want to go on with fitness clubs you do a time 4 them so they are not distracted and we can swim bec we have all payed.or make another private swimming pool.\nI heard 2 ladies really complaining paying alot of money for the club and lots of men looking at them and to much noise e.t.c\nIf anyone reads this il recommend you to go birm holiday inn near the airport.\nFreindly staff , lift ,clean stairs , big room and bathroom ,bathtub ,fridge ,coffee machine,big swimming pool,very clean hotel,the hotel is much appealing to look at.\nI really enjoyed my stay there and they even have a car to pick you.",

The best part though,has to be the staff, they are all different to most I encounter  at rival hotels,which is a credit to themselves as well as the training they have from management. I can’t remember all their names but on reception, Honey is brilliant, so are Shiwani and Megan, you can’t beat a smile and a happy helpful persona when you check in. They are great Girls and very professional but with a personal touch. Mo who is F&B manager has a great team, including Tiya, Twinkle and Manisha. The Breakfast in the morning is very good, brilliantly run by Charleen who has been at the hotel for a good few years. I cannot fault this hotel and always look forward to my visits there. Huge credit to Jaime, his management team and the wonderful staff that make this hotel what it is. Look forward to my next visit in the New Year, best regards Colin",

Strapped the key to my wrist and went poolside. There were a handful of people in the actual pool. Great atmosphere, and after a couple of hours, i got out. The pool was a lovely temperature, and the life guards were very observant. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the pool and will be going again.

This has completely crushed my confidence. my swimming is not pretty by any means but it is safe. i wanted to build the social confidence and was scared to get started and her handling of this situation (which was about 2 months ago now) has left me avoiding swimming altogether even though it helps my pain. What has made me most angry is that i have been to this pool before. there is adult/elderly swimmers who cannot swim a lap and take long breaks. my friend said a man came in after we left and kept stopping mid-length and this life guard said NOTHING to him. i believe i was treated this way because she deemed me to be a teenager, which would make it wrong still anyways! i’m actually quite an anxious/quiet person and really hate confrontation which may be obvious from how i handled it in the moment, but people close to me advised i send an email/write a review. i thought I’d give a chance and just send an email first, so i sent a genuinely polite email to Bert Williams and wv active with hopes that they would care about something like this, and i was ignored, so that shows you enough. i know they received my email as i got a confirmation saying they would reply soon… two months later and nothing. disgusting place, and upon telling friends and family they have reconsidered getting memberships.",

I LOVE this gym, it has a great vibe, its never too busy even at peak times, it's very clean and thr machines are spaced out very well. I manage to get on all the equipment I want to use with ease. The equipment is nee and maintained well. The womens changing rooms have large lockers, are very clean and the shower cubicles are spacious. They have a hair dryer and straightener so you could easily do a morning session and get ready for work with ease. The only thing they need is a full length mirror. For the price you pay, classes are included too so you can't really go wrong with going here. Definitely worth moving here.",

The gym floor is the only thing that doesn't feel overcrowded but I can get better facilities from a budget chain gym if I just wanted that, and for a fraction of the price.

We were placed in the deep end without being informed, which made my 1-year-old daughter uncomfortable and distressed. The instructor did not come over at all to offer support or guidance. Instead, she simply waved for my mum to bring my daughter over to the other children—expecting them to move from the deep end to the shallow end on their own, which was both unrealistic and dangerous.\n\nAt no point were we advised to start in the shallow end, nor was any effort made to accommodate my daughter’s discomfort. My mum had to take her out of the lesson early, and the instructor showed no concern or interest. It felt dismissive, and it’s difficult not to question whether this had anything to do with the fact that we were the only people of colour in the class.\n\nOn top of this, a stranger—a man—approached my mum and asked if she needed help getting out of the pool. Given that this was a designated children's and baby swimming class, this interaction felt odd and raised concerns about security within the facility.\n\nSafety and inclusivity should be top priorities in swimming lessons, especially for young children, and this experience did not reflect that at all. I wouldn’t recommend this class to parents looking for a supportive and secure environment for their child’s first experience in the pool. Avoid at all costs!",

The changing rooms seem to be one of the cleanest of the Midlands franchise, and the sauna seems to be one of the top 2 best saunas in the whole jd franchise in the West Midlands, the parking issues here seems to be sorted but I guess at busy times you will have a problem with parking, you get 3 hours if you add your car reg inside the gym on the iPad located at the front desk, if not you only have 2 hours of free parking before you get a fine sent to your door. The gym is suitable for PWDs and others in that category.

What really lets this place down is the provision for female truckers like myself who might want somewhere to stop for the night. So last night I decided to stop and get a shower, not the best choice I've made, motorway services and other truck stops offer far better. To get access you have to go through the men's, then you have 2 separate rooms, one toilet, one shower. The shower itself was a little dire, shower head needs replacing as it delivers a torrent of water instead of an actual shower. The extractor fan in there doesn't work either so you're left in a stifling box room and can't open the door until you're fully dressed as it opens into the men's toilet/shower area. Which BTW, the men get 5 shower cubicles, 3 sinks, a full width mirror and hot air dryer for drying hands with. Oh and 2 toilet bowls which thankfully is hidden behind the door. I did mention it to the lovely lady last night who was quite helpful. Come on though guys, more women like myself might stay the night if it was known you actually cater for lady truckers. The poor offering we get right now isn't an offering, it's an insult.",

I really liked the modern upgrade and cosiness it had. Unfortunately because of the space of the kitchen there was only ever enough room for one person to cook at a time, which I personally didn't mind as me and my flatmates barely ran into eachother. I was also very fortunate to have one of the flatmates that would help clean up the place with me so we didn't have such a messy kitchen.\n\nAs for the room, upon arrival it looked pretty good, had more space than the official university accommodation as well as another private accommodation that almost everyone used. Having lived at the university one for 2 years, visited the other tall private accommodation numerous times. This one by far was the best stay, and I have to thank the staff for it too as they were always friendly, helpful, and very accomodating to every need I had, whether in person or through the accomodation's app.\n\nI also really appreciated that they have a cashback scheme which was definitely the biggest reason I decided to check them out, and eventually book with them.\n\nI also understand that a lot of the mess people refer to in staying in accomodation is simply down to the fact they themselves and/or their flatmates do not have the skills to clean up after themselves or respect the place they live in as well the people around who use the same space.\n\nThe most important factor for people picking their accommodation is the quality of the room, for reference the Flat i stayed at in block A, the cheapest room available, the bed was a wooden built in frame so it was secure and there was also no creaks, very sturdy, made of thick materials even down to where the bed laid on top of. It also provided underbed storage which could be accessed by lifting the mattress: good for storage of suitcases, boxes you wouldn't need till the very end when moving out.\nThe toilet is smaller than the other 2 accomodation's I've stayed at before but enough space for one person at a time.\nThe closet was a standard size similar to all other accomodation's and had compartments on the lower 1 side.\nUnfortunately my room was a corner of the building so I only had half a desk space compared to others, so keep in mind when choosing your room, do so via a desktop so you can choose which room you want exactly, the floor layout, distance from kitchen etc. (Also really appreciated that feature as other accomodation's wouldnt let you pick the location of your room, just the type).\nRadiator location of that room was a tad bit inconvenient as it would get too hot when you're working at the desk, another downside was the windows having spiders outside it. So i lived in fear of leaving it open for long incase bugs came in but fortunately they didn't.\nSound proofing, you can hear people when they come into the flat, every noise made. Doors are heavy and close automatically for safety and are slow release but still make a noise but the kitchen one in particular. I didn't have any wall neighbours only above and below. Could hear heavy walking from above but not music or anything. Below neighbours I heard nothing.\nFlatmates I can hear if its silent in my room and they're shouting through a headset. Can also hear you too if you're having a normal conversation in your room and you're in the corridor. I had the kitchen next door so I did hear noises and muffled conversation, chairs moving but only when the room is quiet at night. But in essence, you can hear if your flatmates are in if you listen for them. Tbf we were all quiet flatmates.\n\nBig plus to my room was the sunrise view in the morning come spring-summer time.\n\nOverall find little to no fault in the accomodation and their services. Fave feature was knowing when washing machines were available so you don't come down with a load only to find out all 5 are used.",

Great location with a 24 hour McDonald's 2 minutes away for breakfast or late night grub. Room was spotless and very comfortable. Shower room was fine, I had a bit of a mission trying to get a stable temperature in the shower the first time I used it but I strongly suspect other guests were using theirs at the same time and the hot water system was struggling. Second time was fine. Nice little garden out the back to sit with a coffee and listen to the birds. Entry codes were provided in plenty of time and I was made aware of the need for photo ID and a refundable security deposit well in advance. If you read your T's & C's there are no hidden surprises with this place. Very impressed and will definitely book again next time I am stopping in Wolverhampton.",

Porta cabin showers were fabulous, the toilets do get a bit messy especially as it was raining, and the chemical smell is a bit strong, but everything cleaned regularly. The space is amazing, 2 huge fields, fresh water taps, chemical loo disposal, electric hook ups available and wash up sinks with warm water! All the team were so friendly and welcoming from booking through to being on site. We will be back.\nGreat for groups and anyone looking for some peace and quiet as space is so big.",

Plenty of toilets. Always plenty of toilet roll and hand wash.\nVery good accessible shower/toilet, family friendly. Lovely choice of grass or hard standing pitches (level gravel) with or without electric. Well spaced pitches set at different angles so you don't feel too overlooked. Lovely peaceful setting. There is a little background traffic noise at times during the day, (not too intrusive) but not so noticeable after rush hour has passed. Lovely wooden play park with house/slide/swings. Staff are so friendly, helpful and very approachable. All the team work very hard to make your stay as welcoming and relaxing as possible. They obviously take pride in their site - it shows.\nLovely walks all around in the forest.

On arrival day we found a hospitality tray in the kitchen (nice gesture) that caused distaste due to Eggs, Haribo sweets, butter biscuits and dairy milk offered\n\nWe have stayed for 3 nights at the Lodge, that was well designed spacious for family of 4 and well equipped. As others said hospitality tray together with coffee machine was a very nice touch.\nThe swimming pool rather small and play area tiny but quiet so we have had a nice time. Very reasonably priced also during school holidays.",

          "reviewText": "4 of us spent 4 nights in Newbrook Lodge this month as we were using it as a base to travel to different places such as drayton manor, sealife, birmingham and a few other places, I was amazed at how lovely it was, not only was the lodge spotlessly clean we were surprised at all the complimentory things that were there all we needed were ourselves, food and clothing everything else was supplied including dressing gowns.. Bottle of wine if we wanted it, coffee and latte pods also Wifi.. The lodge was fast to warm up when we arrived back each day, There was a booklet explaining everything to do in the lodge, how to turn everything on and off, wifi password, dishwasher, pod machine however we never managed to master that one.\nparking was just by the side of the lodge which made life much easier for me as I can only walk a few feet as i rely very much on wheelchair to get around. The site was fairly secure and really good that there were barriers in and out of it, my grandson loved the fact he memorised the code for our few days there.  The site was really peaceful, in fact we only saw one gentleman there walking a little dog in all the time we were there. What I did love was the birds early morning and evening singing away..  If we venture that way again this is where we are planning to stay again.  Well worth the stay.",
