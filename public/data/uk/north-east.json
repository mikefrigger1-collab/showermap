But I have to be honest...\n\nWhile the new gym equipment is great, the chest fly (an essential for any gym) is constantly out of order. And the Smith machine is the noisiest I've ever used - needs some serious TLC or replaced. Most other stuff is fine.\n\nThe mixed changing room situation doesn't work at all. To go to the loo I need to walk through the mixed changing rooms in my gym gear, past mothers and daughters getting changed. I eventually get to the toilets that are flooded with pool water and urine since these are the main (mixed) toilets for swimmers. It's not great. There should be separate dry toilets (other than the disabled w/c) for those not swimming. The current situation is insane and nobody is happy with it.\n\nThe staff are great and the gym has a nice relaxed vibe. I don't use the pool that often these days but it's generally been fine. On the cooler side but I wouldn't describe it as 'cold'. Sadly this building is showing its age though and by modern standards it's a 3* facility at best. The only proper solution is to start again with a new building and I doubt this will happen any time soon.",

Changing rooms were modern, clean, and plenty of cubicles. Lockers are £1 (refundable). The pool was lush - good temperature, clean & attentive lifeguard. The session wasn't busy - I think about 6 others in the pool, so a nice, relaxing lane swim, with a super-wide slow lane. Bliss! Hot showers, but only a limited number of toilets. The price of the swim + city centre parking makes this an occasional treat, but definitely worth it!",

The gym itself is decent — plenty of free weights, enough benches, and a moderate number of machines. There are also plenty of pull-up bars, which I like. It’s not the most equipped gym (no Smith machines, for example), but it’s good enough for my training. Staff are always around and seem friendly.\n\nThe sauna is honestly the main reason I stay — if it wasn’t for that, I probably wouldn’t be here. The gym floor is never crowded, which is a huge plus compared to most city-centre gyms. The sauna, though, can get busy at certain times, especially evenings and weekends.\n\nA few things could be improved:\n•  The water fountains are poor — barely any pressure, takes ages to fill a bottle. Not a huge issue, but still annoying.\n\n•. The changing rooms can smell pretty bad at times — a mix of warm urine, faeces, and strong cleaning chemicals. It’s improved recently, but still unpleasant some days.\n\n•  Broken equipment takes too long to get fixed. One of the cable machines has been out of order for weeks now, and one time the cold plunge bucket was out of order for a month plus.\n\n•  The weekend hours are too short. The gym and sauna close early on Saturdays and Sundays, which is frustrating if you work weekends and want to use the sauna after your shift.\n\nI pay £47/month for a corporate membership, which gives access to all Fusion gyms across the country. Honestly, I’m mainly paying for the location, the sauna, the pool, and the fact it’s not crowded. If another gym nearby offered those same perks, I’d switch in a heartbeat.",

          "reviewText": "I’ve been a regular visitor to Jesmond Pool for about three years, typically going once or twice a week, and it has easily become one of the best pools in the local area. What originally drew me to Jesmond Pool was its fantastic opening hours. Unlike most local authority pools that close around 4 or 5 p.m., Jesmond Pool stays open until as late as 10 p.m. on some nights. For anyone working a 9–5 job, this is a blessing, as it’s one of the only pools in the area offering such convenient evening hours.\n\nFacilities\n\nDespite the age of the building (over 100 years old), the pool is exceptionally well-maintained. It may be relatively small, but that doesn’t take away from its cleanliness and the atmosphere it provides. I also use the gym facilities, which are surprisingly well-equipped for their size. The gym, located in the basement, includes multiple squat racks and equipment for all major muscle groups. The only limitation is the space itself, but the team does an incredible job of packing in everything you’d need for a full workout. Unless you’re a hardcore bodybuilder looking for old-school, niche equipment, you’ll find everything you need!\n\nStaff & Customer Service\n\nThe staff at Jesmond Pool are second to none. They’re not only professional but genuinely friendly and knowledgeable, especially when it comes to the swimming lessons offered. A special shoutout goes to Alex, Donna, and their team, who ensure lessons are both fun and highly professional. Matty always greets visitors with a smile, and Phil and the management team are some of the kindest, most community-driven people I’ve ever met. Their passion for swimming and love for the local community shines through, making Jesmond Pool stand out from the more commercial gyms and pools. The community spirit here is truly unrivaled in the North East.\n\nCommunity Feel & Ambience\n\nJesmond Pool has a unique, welcoming, and community-driven atmosphere that’s hard to find anywhere else. It’s clear that the staff and trustees run this facility out of love for the community, which is reflected in every aspect of the service.\nAccessibility & Cleanliness\n\nLocated close to West Jesmond Metro, Jesmond Pool is extremely accessible by public transport, though parking can be a bit tricky given it’s in a residential area. But honestly, the small, close-knit nature of the pool is what makes it so special. If it had a giant multi-storey car park, it would lose the intimate charm that makes it a hidden gem in the North East.\n\nThe changing rooms, showers, and general cleanliness of the facility are top-notch. Considering the building’s age and the limited space, the team does an excellent job of keeping everything clean and in working order.\n\nValue for Money\n\nJesmond Pool is managed by a local charitable trust, and they do a remarkable job of keeping the facility open and affordable. For instance, a swim, steam, and sauna session costs just £7, and lockers are a mere 20p—a small price to pay to support the upkeep of such a fantastic community facility.\n\nFavorite Aspect\n\nWhat I love most about Jesmond Pool is the community spirit and the friendliness of the staff. It’s a place where you feel welcomed and valued, and that’s something money can’t buy.\nWould I Recommend It?\n\nJesmond Pool is a true treasure in the Newcastle area, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. Big up the Jesmond Pool massive!",

For anyone working a 9–5 job, this is a blessing, as it’s one of the only pools in the area offering such convenient evening hours.\n\nFacilities\n\nDespite the age of the building (over 100 years old), the pool is exceptionally well-maintained. It may be relatively small, but that doesn’t take away from its cleanliness and the atmosphere it provides. I also use the gym facilities, which are surprisingly well-equipped for their size. The gym, located in the basement, includes multiple squat racks and equipment for all major muscle groups. The only limitation is the space itself, but the team does an incredible job of packing in everything you’d need for a full workout. Unless you’re a hardcore bodybuilder looking for old-school, niche equipment, you’ll find everything you need!\n\nStaff & Customer Service\n\nThe staff at Jesmond Pool are second to none. They’re not only professional but genuinely friendly and knowledgeable, especially when it comes to the swimming lessons offered. A special shoutout goes to Alex, Donna, and their team, who ensure lessons are both fun and highly professional. Matty always greets visitors with a smile, and Phil and the management team are some of the kindest, most community-driven people I’ve ever met. Their passion for swimming and love for the local community shines through, making Jesmond Pool stand out from the more commercial gyms and pools. The community spirit here is truly unrivaled in the North East.\n\nCommunity Feel & Ambience\n\nJesmond Pool has a unique, welcoming, and community-driven atmosphere that’s hard to find anywhere else. It’s clear that the staff and trustees run this facility out of love for the community, which is reflected in every aspect of the service.\nAccessibility & Cleanliness\n\nLocated close to West Jesmond Metro, Jesmond Pool is extremely accessible by public transport, though parking can be a bit tricky given it’s in a residential area. But honestly, the small, close-knit nature of the pool is what makes it so special. If it had a giant multi-storey car park, it would lose the intimate charm that makes it a hidden gem in the North East.\n\nThe changing rooms, showers, and general cleanliness of the facility are top-notch. Considering the building’s age and the limited space, the team does an excellent job of keeping everything clean and in working order.\n\nValue for Money\n\nJesmond Pool is managed by a local charitable trust, and they do a remarkable job of keeping the facility open and affordable. For instance, a swim, steam, and sauna session costs just £7, and lockers are a mere 20p—a small price to pay to support the upkeep of such a fantastic community facility.\n\nFavorite Aspect\n\nWhat I love most about Jesmond Pool is the community spirit and the friendliness of the staff. It’s a place where you feel welcomed and valued, and that’s something money can’t buy.\nWould I Recommend It?\n\nJesmond Pool is a true treasure in the Newcastle area, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. Big up the Jesmond Pool massive!",

          "reviewText": "In response to the reply I received:\n\nThank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. However, I would like to clarify a few points:\n\n1. Shoe Policy: I understand the need to keep the changing rooms clean, but my concern is more about the hygiene of having to walk through wet areas with bare feet, especially when cleanliness is already an issue. As well as the inconvenience caused by having to remove shoes and sock’s constantly. Perhaps providing shoe covers or some form of path would be more hygienic for everyone. Having reception staff say “we have cut down on cleaning” isn’t what you want to hear.\n\n2. Equipment Condition: While the equipment may be new, I’ve noticed that some machines are stiff and difficult to use, or make noises which indicate that there may be a maintenance issue or just something that needs adjustment.\n\n3. Operating Hours: My comment about early closures was based on my experience, which may have been during holiday hours or exceptions. It would be helpful if holiday hours were communicated more clearly to avoid any confusion. For example, I arrived on a Sunday at 16:25 and the doors were locked - there were two other people having the exact same issue so evidently there is confusion. This happened on 2 or 3 occasions not just once.\n\n4. Temperature and Air Conditioning: The air conditioning might be new, but during my visits, it hasn’t felt sufficient to keep the gym at a comfortable temperature. If possible, please look into ensuring that the temperature is more consistently regulated.\n\nFinally, I found the tone of your response to be quite dismissive and unprofessional, particularly with the repeated use of the word \"hardly.\" While I understand the need to defend your facility, it’s important to acknowledge customer concerns without undermining them. A more constructive and respectful response would go a long way in maintaining a positive relationship with your members who are evidently frustrated when paying for a service that isn’t up to standard. If your customers are telling you the gym and pool is unhygienic (as many of the reviews state) maybe stop telling your customers they are wrong, take the feedback and use it productively.\nThanks!\n\nProbably the worst gym I’ve ever been to.\nSo unhygienic it’s beyond a joke, changing rooms absolutely stink of urine. Also now have to take your shoes off to get to one part of the gym which then leaves your feet soaking wet as you have to walk through the changing rooms/ pool because they’ve “cut back on cleaning” to Quote one of the guys on reception. Don’t really know how it’s possible to cut back anymore than it already was. Also not what you want to hear from your gym when gyms are notorious for bacteria and germs anyway. Had to go and get my own shoe covers because I think it’s disgusting having to take my shoes and socks off twice to get in and out of the gym and walk through the grim changing rooms. Equipment is poorly maintained and stiff. Not worth the price at all. Also close early all the time so you’ll arrive to do a session and it’s already closed. Both sections of gym boiling hot also with barely any, if any at all air conditioning .",

The lifeguard asked us to move to the family area, which was extremely crowded and too shallow to swim properly. When several swimmers complained, the lifeguard showed no understanding and just told us to “try anyway,” which was not acceptable.\n\nWe stayed only about 15 minutes before leaving, because it was impossible to swim. On top of this, when I found and returned a lost phone to the cashier, there was not even a simple “thank you.” The staff were generally unfriendly, and the whole experience was unpleasant.\n\nI would not return here again, and I would not recommend it to others.",

This company 'Better leisure'  took over from our local council where my daughter has recently finished swimming lessons as she's completed all the levels. 3 days before they took over, we were told by reception at the club that we shouldnt cancel the newly set up direct debit as it would mean we would get charged a fee, and to wait until the day they took over then call in and let them know that our daughter was already signed off the full course of lessons so it was just to be closed down. They however have ported over my 'membership', which i have never had, we weren't members of the leisure club, we just paid for our daughters swimming lessons, and have charged us for a full months swimming lessons, that she is not in as she has completed them all, and are not refunding the money! Complete and utter scam! You have to submit a refund request online, cannot talk to anyone, and then they just ignore the issue and do whatever they want! I've paid £34 for literally nothing, not one single lesson!! They have 'credited' £8 to my 'account', so are keeping the rest by the looks of it. And for what??? Not a single lesson!!!! We didn't sign up for any membership ever. When the lessons are finished that's it. I will be disputing this with the bank to claim the money back. Disgusting company and disgusting lack of any customer service. Making money by blatently stealing money from parents!!!",

Staff at the reception is always friendly to me, especially Jill, who helps when I struggle with anything eg the new “better UK” app.\nHowever, last Friday I felt, I was in the wrong film. After the aerobic class finished, a group of elderly women (like every Friday) gathered in the middle of the pool and started chatting. Like every week, my friend and I try to swim around them together with other swimmers. This made me swimming close to the fast lane. A young man from that lane soaked me, especially my hair, which I wanted to keep dry for an appointment afterwards. I never said anything in the past but this time I felt I had to say something as I wasn’t the only person, who got splashed by his swimming style. I asked him politely if he could be a bit more considerate but he cheekily replied if I was serious and that I shouldn’t swim so close to his lane. I explained that the pool was full and the only thing I wanted was a bit of consideration when so many people are around. He then said this is a pool and that I’m silly. Next he turned around to the lifeguard, a young woman with glasses, who agreed with him. I bit my tongue but I wished I told her if she would have done her job and told the elderly group of women just once to move on to the side of the pool,  this incident could have been avoided. I was also disappointed in her response towards me as this proved only a lackadaisical attitude towards lifeguard’s duties.",

This can be a very unhygienic process, especially for men. It's also amazing value for money, and all the staff team (including the management) work tirelessly to keep the entire facility and equipment (thousands of items from single disc weights to complex electro-mechanical machinery and hundreds of lockers) in usable order. If your expectations are of standards equivalent to the Talise Spa at The Burj Al Arab it isn't going to happen !!!\n\nThere are also a very small number who go expecting to massively boost their physical attributes with minimal effort then look for any possible excuses for their meagre (if any) gainz. Not that I'm saying this is the case here........\n\nI had successful surgery 2.5 years ago following a traffic collision to remove a cancerous lesion from my skull following a blunt trauma brain injury. Once able to train again I much preferred using the fantastic fully controllable shower facilities at this gym to support my ongoing recovery (and still do) as I have every faith in their entire cleaning regime. Yes the mens changing rooms very occasionally smell but nowhere near as bad as stated and mostly because some men very occasionally smell (and can be unhygienic).

The air-con seldom works, lots of equipment is at the time of writing out of order, water fountains are luke-warm instead of cold and the car park is a complete nightmare.\n\nDavid Lloyd unfortunately does everything it can to exploit money out of its customers - I was on a platinum membership (which I didn’t need) but was told to reduce a tier I’d have to pay more. That in itself goes to show how wild the payment system is. I also know the tier below don’t get towels (unless they pay) despite any newer joiners paying more than me. I paid £160 a month, so for someone to be paying more than that and not get a towel is pretty disgusting.\n\nFor the price point everything should always be outstanding, and it just isn’t. I also paid for a PT as part of my wedding prep, granted he’s since left but he was continually late, or on one occasion didn’t turn up at all. I did tell management this and because he’d left nothing was offered as compensation for the £100s I’d wasted being let down by an unreliable PT. In fact I was told they would look into it and then never heard again. Just not good enough I’m afraid, so I’ve decided to take my money elsewhere. The fee is more than I paid in London for a virgin gym. Complete exploitation.",

It's a small, family run, relatively tight knit gym where you see the same faces every time you go. Everyone there seems to be very focused and committed to bodybuilding. It's in an industrial estate, and is easily accessible by car (if you drive). A lot of money is being invested in equipment within the gym. The only suggestion I would make would be to install water chillers within the gym in several areas to refill your water bottle, The only place to do this is in the toilet within the changing rooms.",

It's a small, family run, relatively tight knit gym where you see the same faces every time you go. Everyone there seems to be very focused and committed to bodybuilding. It's in an industrial estate, and is easily accessible by car (if you drive). A lot of money is being invested in equipment within the gym. The only suggestion I would make would be to install water chillers within the gym in several areas to refill your water bottle, The only place to do this is in the toilet within the changing rooms.",

Upped their prices by £4 a month recently, I’d expect at least clean toilets 24/7. It’s also not just hot when it’s busy, it’s hot all the time in all areas.

I'll explain:\n\nThe variety of machine is amazing, and most good quality hammer strength. I think there are 9 separate dual cable stations on the main floor (heavily used and sometimes difficult to find an empty station.)This isn't the gyms fault, it's the same in all gyms ... people love them.  This goes for the lat pull down and 3 cable row stations near the entrance. Difficult to get on, and again I think it's down to a lot of people feeling more comfortable (newbies) in the area than venturing to the play loaded section.\n\nChanging rooms at peak times are challenging, and nothing to do with staff I think.... it's the footfall. People claim a locker and think it's theirs to use forever. People leave the toilets in disgusting state, ripping toilet dispenser off the wall. Mess on seats and floors. Customers hygiene is terrible in the changing rooms. The staff do their best but you can't constantly be cleaning up the animals mess.\n\nI think it's mostly the students letting it down.\n\nCould do with more toilets cubicles in the men's. 2 isn't enough for the size of the place.\n\nIt's recently got extremely busy on an evening. Almost offputting which I've never felt until the last few weeks.  If you're going to have 3 racks of dumbbells I think you need to double up on the dumbbells up to 10kg). Countless times people are waiting about for 6/8/10kg to be free. While 1 person might use 50->60kg once in a while.\n\nHow about when you sign in via qr code you get allocated a locker? It's difficult because not all phones have nfc reader to open/lock a locker with. I've seen gyms in northumberland use mifare technology via an issued card.\n\nI can't fault the staff and job they are doing. Love the gym, the customers let it down though.",

We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

Architecturally beautiful and lovingly restored with incredible attention to detail from the pool side cubicle changing curtains to the tasteful period furniture in the upper floors . The members and staff , friendly and charming shared their special place with us and we very much appreciated . Pool , steam , sauna and jacuzzi left us refreshed and ready for breakfast. Changing rooms and shower  areas were super clean and tidy . Then to breakfast well !!! This was another level and unexpected , ibérico chop with Catalan beans duck egg , morcilla and membrillo was a Hispanic combination I would have only expected to find in heaven , congratulations to the genius who pulled that baby to the pass at menu development . As in many cases sadly wonderful food not matched by service , would you like some toast with that or anything else we can get you would have been nice and a simple upsell , regardless come to expect these things and move on albeit annoying. Having said that the food quality setting and environment made for one of the most memorable breakfast. Thank you .",

This was a shame as the pool was starting to empty out but there were still a number of children in the areas that were deep enough to swim. It is a lovely setting and the pool was very refreshing, it is unheated. There are grassy areas where you can sit if you are planning to be there for a few hours. It is definitely aimed at families. It would be nice if Bradford Council set aside the last hour of opening for adult lane swims. The changing rooms are in serious need of a revamp - 3 showers, 2 sinks, 6 cubicles, dirty and wet everywhere. For £11.95 a swim, they should be much better than they are. Bizarrely we were asked twice to be quiet as there was a soundbath going on in the next room - this at the end of the evening when lots of people were showering (or queuing to shower!) and changing.",

A few lockers are provided but tried 4 before we found one that actually shut,but then you either need to bring your own lock,or purchase one from reception for £5 😱😱😱\nThere is an outdoor shower for 3 people and changing stalls so you can get changed. There is a bonus of  Snack Shack where you can purchase food and drink at very reasonable prices.",

First two times we've been there wasn't so busy, the third time it got way busier because kids started the Summer holidays, so it was a little bit of wait in the queue, but no more than maybe 10 minutes. We did booked the tickets in advance always. There's a café restaurant there as well where you can buy food. I've had the double cheeseburger with cheesy fries and it's a very generous portion, so make sure you have the appetite to finish it. Highly recommend it for an enjoyable family time.",

Sections of the pool, which is an irregular shape, are divided into  slides/splash area, an area for families, and a section for lane swimming. The outdoor pool is part of a leisure centre with indoor pool, but access to the outdoor pool is separate to the leisure centre and can be reached via the car park. Plenty of free parking. We went for an early morning lane swim - there were only 4 of us in the pool, so plenty of space and the local/regular swimmers made us feel really welcome (even giving us 'Friends of Aldershot Lido' swimming caps, which were a lovely souvenir of our visit). The laned section of the pool is about 25-30m & fairly deep. Pool is well maintained and lovely to see the traditional fountain in operation. Changing facilities are basic but clean & clean toilets and hot showers. Lockers available poolside, but bring padlock. Overall we really enjoyed our visit 😊",

An example of a member of staff, is Tommy Johnson who is a breathe of fresh air.

But now that it’s been taken over by JD Gyms, they’ve clearly spent a lot of money turning this into a super-mega gym!\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice is how much space there is and the open-plan layout of the place. It’s laid out really well and it’s easy to find what you’re looking for … even though this place is a mammoth 24,000 sq.ft\n\nThe cardio area is all in a line and it’s easy to spot where machines are free. The main part of the gym floor is full of machines and plate loaded equipment, which looks awesome from above.\n\nThey have a functional Eleiko rig area with 6 Olympic weightlifting platforms, so you won’t struggle to get on anything even at busy times. And that free weights area is massive, just look at some of the pictures!\n\nThe only things that aren’t open-plan are the main studio for classes, and the cool-blue Spin room. It’s worth noting that classes are free and included in the price of membership.\n\nThe changing rooms have been upgraded, and with new lockers too, which is a bonus.\n\nOverall for the money you’re paying (currently £19.99 per month), it’s definitely worth joining - even if you’re a member of another gym already. Either cancel your old membership and join here, or just have both. It’s cheap enough!",

First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

Visited the food shop and grabbed a burger meal (dry burger and bland fries)and staff were pretty indifferent.

Firstly if you're early, you're paying £10 per hour you're early despite the room being ready. Next, you're paying £25 bank transfer PER PERSON deposit. Expect to never see this money again. Checkout is at 10am, I guarantee there will be nobody on the desk. We had to leave our room key card on the reception desk after 20 minutes of waiting. another group was also waiting and had been for some time (they had paid their deposit in cash). Owner phoned, \"checked cameras\" which is obviously untrue, and I didn't leave the key card. Just a way to scam people of deposit money. Ultimately I will say the room was clean and the beds were comfy, the shower is literally unusable but this place is fine for a night, provided you don't mind paying £25 extra per person, because you will never see that money again. AVOID and book somewhere less dodgy.",

All the doors bang so when people come late and it wakes you at all hours. The sunlight shines pretty much all day, there is only a roller blind which does not block out the light, the bed is right beside the window so can be hard to sleep. Not the room advertised as there was no sofa or ironing facilities. But as I say, it was cheap and close to the centre. The room itself was reasonably clean with fresh towels and the management were accommodating allowing us to stay in the room until 4pm for a small fee. Also there is only 1 light, the main bed room light either on or off lol.",

The pitches are huge and really spread out amongst the long grass so it felt really peaceful. I was a bit nervous about the composting toilets but they worked fine and the hot showers were excellent. The friendly alpacas kept the kids entertained and the fact it’s only a five minute walk to the Running Fox cafe and shop is a huge bonus. Will definitely be returning.",

Pretty solar lights illuminated the hot tub as we watched the sun set, a fire pit provides a warm glow as the chill of the night descends, and the benefit of a covered porch with chairs offers solace from the wind while still enjoying the views covered by the cosy blanket provided.\nWith walking access to Gibside, it really is the perfect getaway to enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside and explore the local area.

I didn't have a problem with it at all. If I want modern and sparkly clean I wouldn't go camping!! Dogs are welcome. It's a busy working farm so do expect tractors etc to go trundling past throughout the day/evening. There's a nice pub just a few minutes drive away that serves good beer and great food.

The fridge, toaster and microwave was all really helpful for a bite to eat in the evening and at breakfast. We saw some fairy lights around the front of the pod but didn't realise until later that we could have paid for the power source for these - they looked lovely on other pods and helpful for finding the pod on the way back from the toilet so would do this next time! The site itself was lovely to walk around with stunning views and animals. Other visitors were quiet and friendly. The amenities block was very clean with modern toilets and showers. There was also a dishwashing room with board games, sinks and vending machines which was useful for washing up in the morning. Overall we had a very comfortable stay and would love to come back and bring the kids as they would have loved the playground and animals - next time we will look to book one with a hot tub! Thanks for a great stay.",

But we took advantage of the hot tub and log pit.\nThere is plenty to do in the area - Hadrians wall, sycamore gap, Vindolanda fort and village, kielder forest and the list goes on. At Kielder Forest we did their zip wire (a roller coaster of a zip wire!) and archery. Great fun.\nI've marked them down only because the fairy lights that are strung around the outside of the pod were inaccessible and apparently only come with the birthday package! Surely they don't use much electricity.  If they were on all the time and the skies were clear they would have spoilt the dark skies - a separate switch would have overcome that.\nThey only thing missing was a rack to hang our damp towels on.\nGreat stay and would recommend.",

All were a great size and very clean. There is an outside kitchen area to do your washing up, it’s surrounded by Aloe Vera so had a very tropical feel about it. The view is beautiful! The campsite is terraced so everyone is able to see the stunning vista. Caroline and Des were wonderful hosts, easily contactable before hand and if we had any questions while we were there. Its location to Newcastle and the surrounding areas is fantastic. Highly recommend, we will be back.",

The location is fantastic, a 5 min drive from Newcastle town, and 10 mins from both Tollymore Forest Park and Castlewellan park. Just 2 mins up the road is a spot to do some rock pool swimming (recommended by Caroline our host). Caroline and Desy were so welcoming and lovely. They were there if we needed them , which we didn't as everything that we needed was there. Clean toilet facilities, plenty of power sockets and some picnic benches to have your morning coffee and snacks.\n\nThe views from the campsite are stunning and because all the campers are nestled in amongst the trees it didn't feel like you were on top of your neighbour.\n\nGood value for money too at £30 per night for a 4-man tent. Would highly recommend this campsite in an absolutely beautiful area near the Mourne Mountains. :-)",

It had an onsite arcade and games place with outdoor electric trikes for children. The staff were lovely especially the lady I will always remember from the on-site fish & chip shop. You of course had the permanent theme park too at Spanish city ! Was such a beautiful place. Have been for a while but planning to get up there next year so I can now pass on memories and take my child as my mum & dad did for me. The Geordies are just the most beautiful people in the world ! Always friendly and always have time for ya. I remember when the big ship caught fire out at sea and washed up on the beach at seaton sluice. I was actually up at this holiday park when it happened.

However this still meant we had nowhere to spend the night.\n\nOn arrival we spoke to staff, who understandably were confused by the whole thing, they confirmed the PR agency failed to actually book a room.\n\nHowever, the staff were excellent they said go take a seat we'll get you some drinks and we will sort it out. They sure did they managed to find is a room in a very nice suite overlooking the river Tyne.  They even arranged for an extra bed for our son in the room.\n\nWhen we got to the room it was clean and well laid out, with a huge bed and tea coffee facilities, plus complimentary drink in the fridge. One thing I really liked was the TV was a nice modern smart TV with things like streaming, YouTube, etc all built it, which makes a change from other hotels I have stayed in.\n\nThe room layout was good, fantastic view of the river and the really weird kinda open plan bathroom. The sink was in the room at one end and the shower was also in the room. The actual only sealed off room was the toilet. A weird and actually quite nice layout.\n\nNow the only down side is parking, there are limited spaces and it's actually the most expensive place to park in Newcastle £18 for 24 hours, so whilst it's convenient for the hotel it's not cheap.\n\nBut all in all a really nice experience. So if you are looking for a hotel in Newcastle go for the INNSiDE and you won't be disappointed.",

Used the Everyone Active app, which I already had an account with, so booking was relatively easy, and comparatively good value for money at £5.95 for an adult swim. The 50m pool was only available on Saturday or Wednesday when we booked - I guess the rest of the week it's divided into 2x25m - but the app made this clear. Parking was easy (and free) at the stadium car park opposite. Reception staff were helpful. Changing rooms were clean, plenty of cubicles, toilets, lockers (£1 returnable or bring your own padlock) and warm showers. There were only 2 of us in the slow lane (the faster lanes seemed busier) on the Saturday afternoon session. Pool is well-maintained and slightly warmer than most competition pools I've swam in. 4 lifeguards who were attentive throughout the session. Definitely worth a visit 👌",

For young children, especially beginners, access to floats is a basic safety measure — not an optional luxury.\n\nThe main pool was also very cold, and even once the small pool reopened, there was no noticeable improvement in temperature. The toilets were unclean, though the showers were hot and the changing rooms reasonably spacious compared to Chester-le-Street’s.\n\nWe had planned to enrol our daughter in swimming lessons here, but after today’s experience, we’re no longer confident this is a child-friendly or safety-conscious environment.",

I’m really glad I only went as a guest because it’s definitely not worth paying full membership for.",

The prices very reasonable (£25 for external customers/cancel 'anytime').\n\nThere is a good selection of classes, including some LesMills pump and grit, some very good instructors and some helpful front desk staff.\n\nThe fitness studio has got some ventilation system but no proper air-conditioning so higher intensity classes are not really enjoyable there (too hot).\n\nThe studio has some new equipment including new benches and new barbells for the pump classes as well as new mats and a new mat hanger so better organised now. Some  more rubber coated dumbbells would maka a nice addition to what is already there. Especially 3kg ones.\n\nThe studio (which they call a multi-purpose room) is of a good size but a large lifting station was added to it-blocks off a large chunk of space. Only approx 10 people can comfortably fit in there for a pump class (although the booking system allows more). This is not a lot for a university with a large number of students. The lifting station could go upstairs to the main gym area-instead of the technogym bikes which are pretty much useless there<- do not hold resistance in a standing up position).\n\nDownsides; the studio is almost always dirty and the cleaners usually claim it was 'cleaned yesterday' when it clearly wasn't.The floor is still unattractive /too bright/shiny+ dirty most of the time with hair, bits of snacks , hair and dried sweat droplets.. . University cleaners only use water to wash it (once in a blue moon). Ideal fitness studio floor would be wooden, non-slippery, not very glossy and washed daily. The mirror at the front of the studio is often filthy with palm prints/smears all over- very unpleasant.\n\nThe classes usually only have a handful of people in them /mostly 40+) I wonder where do all the students go:? Probably looking for another foreigner-friendly club in the area (which from my experience/observations does not exist). Another main reasons students do not come to classes during the day; poor quality drying station/design of the changing room (difficult to quickly take shower and get dried/changed  before a next class.\n\nThe best improvement made; some new nice new colourful lights however not strong enough and remain switched off in most classes.\n\nThe music in some classes is too quiet. Music is a main component of a fitness class and should be positive and  loud enough for us not to hear our joints cracking.\n\nMain things that can be improved here/ worth investing in;\nInstalling proper air-conditioning which instructors can control/set the right temperature for each class according to the intensity and the number of people attending. Especially in pump/spin/grit classes. Improving the design of the changing room so more students/staff can pop in for a class during the day.\n\nNext thing that would be helpful; instructors' names displayed with the timetable so members can choose classes with the instructors they like. Some instructors deliver uninteresting, low energy classes with too loud /or too quiet music and customers usually avoid them. One of the instructors cannot be bothered to show the movements to customers (not fair on other staff who work hard to deliver good classes for the same pay).\n\nFrom my observations reception work does not mix well with a fitness instructor's work. The staf who sit in a front desk often deliver lower quality/low energy classes...ask JD what they do with fitness instructors who cannot attract 6 people to a class. Their system may be 'brutal' but creates better outcome for customers/ results in better attendance.\n\n\"Little John' delivers best strength class so others could learn form him.\n\nNot sure if the facility still  has a manager because he does not respond to emails from members<- which can make members feel unwelcome.",

Only to be let down in multiple ways.\nFirstly, what should have been a 20 minute drive, took 70 minutes because Google maps kept trying to take you to the wrong place in the vast area that is the Nissan complex. The security that we spoke to gave us the worse directions, \"go back the way you came, go to the traffic lights, and then keep turning right 4 times\" (genuinely what he said) only for that to take us back to the same set of traffic lights.\nThere are barely any signs to direct you here and I hope you enjoy going around really large parking lots, because you'll be doing this alot and getting lost in them as well.\nWhen we finally got to the complex, once again let down. When you hear that it is accessible, you'd think you can easily use a wheelchair or a push chair... nope, hope you like climbing steep stairs.\nThe stands and \"music\" that were playing were disappointing to say the least and not giving off a Christmas vibe at all unless you count the choir they had which sounded like elderly relatives that were drunk off their faces having a sing song.\nCut to where we are going to leave but my daughter needed her nappy changed. Toilets are poorly sign posted but relatively easy to find on the lower floor (no toilets upstairs so gotta use the stairs again).\nAt this point it needs to be mentioned that the hygiene record check logs (what needs to be signed AFTER the toilets have been INSPECTED and CLEANED). I'm waiting outside in the hall way while my wife is in the toilet with my daughter and a member of staff walks up to each of the toilet hygiene records, signs her name with a time and DOES NOT EVEN GLANCE INTO THE TOILETS TO SEE IF THEY ARE CLEAN AND WALKS OFF.\nI wish I could give zero stars, because 1 star does not give this place justice as to how awful it is. If you can avoid going to this place, then do it.",

          "reviewText": "I use the women’s area upstairs and it’s a decent size however I wish they had more treadmills (there’s only 2) which isn’t enough. Some things I wish they could improve on: opening times should be at 5am during the week. 6am is late, especially for those who start work at 8 and need to leave by 7. I wish the machines were a little cleaner. Sometimes you can tell it hasn’t been wiped down for weeks. I don’t mind having paper towel and disinfectant spray for us to wipe down before and after using the equipment like we did during Covid. Sometimes there’s not enough handwash in the ladies changing rooms and even though it has been mentioned to staff a few times, it doesn’t get noticed until a few days after. The abductor machine hasn’t been working very well for weeks and makes the loudest screechiest noise, I reported this to the staff however nothing has been done. Although my review seems to be more on the negative side, I do enjoy using this gym as it’s closer to home, good women’s area size and the parking is good (thank you for sorting out them potholes). Hope they can take on the feedback and implement some changes for the better!",

However, that's where the positives stop.\n\nMaintenance is close to non existent. in 3 months I've seen machines that have been broken for weeks if not months at a time. One cycle machine was only just fixed, having been broken day 1 of me attending the gym. Treadmills are dropping off like flies and don't seem to be even considering a fix (2 of them are quickly approaching 2 months I believe).

Jacuzzi and sauna recently out of order for a good month.\n\nGaping hole in the ceiling of the mens changing room when I came last week, dripping lightly, a week later now dripping heavily and splashing all over the floor (Despite the bucket catching the water being almost full to the brim). Absolutely no urgency to fix things at all, even if its going to cost them more leaving it. Like in this case. Mens toilets in the changing rooms are also out of order and have been for a good 6 weeks. The upstairs disabled facilities have been remarked as Male Toilets - Which is an awful band-aid.\n\nGigantic hole in the plaster of the stairs walls covered over by a banner for 2-3 weeks now.. rather than, you know, getting someone in to fix it. No, the sign didn't stop people noticing.\n\nA much nicer gym than my previous one in terms of, at least potential, offerings.. but management and maintenance doesn't even begin to compare.

Nestled in the charming village of Woburn, this historic outdoor pool is a hidden gem that offers a delightful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the stunning Art Deco architecture. The beautifully restored changing rooms, with their vibrant tiles and classic arches, transported me back to the 1930s. It was like stepping into a different era, and I couldn’t help but admire the attention to detail that has gone into preserving this piece of history.\n\nAs I dipped my toes into the crystal-clear water, I was pleasantly surprised by the perfect temperature. The pool is heated to a comfortable 26°C, making it ideal for a leisurely swim or a more vigorous workout. The separate paddling pool for children is a thoughtful touch, ensuring that families can enjoy their time here without any worries.\n\nThe atmosphere at Woburn Lido is incredibly relaxing. Surrounded by lush greenery, the pool area feels like a tranquil oasis. I spent hours lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun, and taking refreshing dips whenever I felt like it. The friendly staff were always on hand, making sure everything was just right.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the sense of community. Locals and visitors alike come together here, creating a warm and welcoming environment. I had some lovely conversations with fellow swimmers, sharing stories and tips about the best spots in the area.\n\nAfter a day of swimming and relaxation, I treated myself to a delicious snack from the on-site kiosk. The selection of refreshments was impressive, and I enjoyed a tasty ice cream while basking in the late afternoon sun.\n\nAs the day came to an end, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for this wonderful experience. Woburn Lido is more than just a swimming pool; it’s a place where memories are made. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful retreat or a fun day out with family and friends, Woburn Lido is the perfect destination.",

In the summer I find it’s better to book a week in advance. Right now it’s limited to 10 swimmers at a time, which tbh is about the max number I’d want for lane swimming anyway. There’s a slow lane and a fast lane, and there are not usually any issues with people being in the wrong place.\n\nThe changing rooms are clean though small. The cafe is good for a quick hot drink to warm up afterwards & is reasonably priced. Lifeguards are welcoming and encouraging. The car park is tiny, but there are hundreds of spaces across the road, which is clearly signposted. Everyone I’ve encountered has been very friendly and at the right time you can spot elephants over at Woburn Safari Park!",

The cafe is good for a quick hot drink to warm up afterwards & is reasonably priced. Lifeguards are welcoming and encouraging. The car park is tiny, but there are hundreds of spaces across the road, which is clearly signposted. Everyone I’ve encountered has been very friendly and at the right time you can spot elephants over at Woburn Safari Park!",

I messaged them to ask if there were any conditions, and I was told the only significant one was a minimum term of one month. No mention was made of the 30-day notice period.\n\nI went to the facilities to try them out, but they were closing and asked me to return the next day. I specifically asked if I could swim for free that month as advertised, and they confirmed this again, with no additional conditions mentioned. I couldn’t go the following day, but they later called me and we agreed I would come back, still with no further information disclosed.\n\nI am traveling in 10 days and simply wanted to try the pool once, with the intention of signing up properly when I return to Brighton. I prepared everything in advance, including bringing my wetsuit and assembling new fins.\n\nWhen I finally arrived, I was told that I would still have to pay for the following month even if I didn’t use the facility, because cancellations require 30 days’ notice. As a result, I couldn’t swim at all.\n\nThis was extremely frustrating. The advertisement was misleading, and despite communicating with them multiple times across different channels, this crucial condition was never mentioned. A “free month” offer that still obliges you to pay for an additional month is not truly free.\n\nThe views are nice when the weather is good, that’s the only positive aspect of my experience.",

My cardio has dramatically improved, I'm lifting up to triple from where I started from and still building, and James has truly instilled genuine joy into working out for me.\n\nThe gym itself is a very easy recommendation: A full spectrum of machines & free weights, an incredibly cool lowered area for circuit & heavy bag training, and a super clean locker & shower area.

Not been to one yet but planning on doing.\nGood staff, free water ( been to other gyms that have no water and charge for small bottles)\nBrilliant opening/closing times especially for shift workers.\nBig car park free parking.\nEven a jukebox for the public which is definitely different.\nThe weights are okay plenty to go at but I find some other gyms are more upper weight happy with more machines.\nBig, open plan sort of gym and a fingerprint scanner to get in.

She is amazing at what she does and has a wonderful teaching style.\n\nMy daughter had went to group lessons from age 4 until age 8 where she was stuck on stage 4 for years. Not because she feared the water, she has always been a water baby but the group lessons she went to had taken too many children and divided the pool into lots of sub groups they bearly had 5 meters in each group to learn in.\n\nWe started lessons with Olivia in April 2024 and between then and now Oliver has shown my daughter the correct technics for each stroke, and she has built her core strength and stamina.\n\nMost importantly Olivia has brought back the joy of swimming for my daughter and in July 2024, just 3.5mths after starting she has went from stage 4 to stage 7!! Achieving this with just one lesson a week !!\n\nBy far the best swimming teacher around and my daughter loves going.\n\nOlivia has a wonderful rapport with her where they have lots of fun but she is always learning and being pushed to be her best.\n\nHighly recommend",

The reception staff are always friendly and helpful, which really made the place feel welcoming.\n\nThe ensuite rooms come with access to a large shared kitchen, and it’s cleaned regularly every week. I also appreciated that all the rooms are cleaned once a month — such a big help during busy student life! Laundry is free to use once a week, and they even keep the washing machines clean and well-maintained.\n\nThere’s also a small on-site gym. It doesn’t have a lot of equipment, but it’s usually quiet, so it’s still useful if you prefer light workouts or just need a basic space to exercise.\n\nThe location is unbeatable — right in the city center. Everything I needed was just a short walk away, including shops, cafes, and public transport. It’s also just a 10-minute walk to both St. Peter’s Campus and the City Campus of Sunderland University.\n\nOverall, it was a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable place to live as a student. Highly recommend!",

The reception staff are always friendly and helpful, which really made the place feel welcoming.\n\nThe ensuite rooms come with access to a large shared kitchen, and it’s cleaned regularly every week. I also appreciated that all the rooms are cleaned once a month — such a big help during busy student life! Laundry is free to use once a week, and they even keep the washing machines clean and well-maintained.\n\nThere’s also a small on-site gym.

          "reviewText": "I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the unacceptable living conditions, unreasonable treatment, and lack of tenant protections at Jopling House. The conduct of management and superintendents has created an environment that is not only unprofessional but also unsafe and unfair to tenants.\n\n1. Unreasonable Conduct by Superintendents\n\nSuperintendents at Jopling House regularly impose fines without legitimate reasons or explanations. Tenants are left confused, with no clear policy, written notice, or justification. This practice is unfair, arbitrary, and appears to be used as a method of intimidation and revenue generation rather than genuine enforcement of building rules.\n\nIn addition, staff have demonstrated disrespectful behavior toward tenants, treating legitimate questions and concerns with hostility rather than professionalism.\n\n2. Barging into Tenant Units Without Consent\n\nOne of the most serious issues is that superintendents and/or staff have entered tenant units without notice or consent—even during times when tenants were in the shower. This is a gross violation of tenant privacy and safety. Entering a unit without proper legal notice or emergency justification constitutes harassment and a breach of tenant rights under housing law.\n\n3. Non-Functional Laundry Facilities\n\nThe laundry facilities are often in disrepair, leaving tenants without access to basic services that are supposed to be included as part of their tenancy. Machines frequently break down, and management does not address or resolve the issues in a timely manner, forcing tenants to seek alternatives at their own expense.\n\n4. Internet Issues and Mismanagement\n\nThe building previously provided a working Wi-Fi service but has since switched tenants to a subpar, unreliable network. Staff have openly admitted that this downgrade was done to save money, despite the significant negative impact on tenants who rely on stable internet for work, study, and daily communication. The current Wi-Fi service is slow, inconsistent, and in no way meets modern standards.\n\n5. Horrible Customer Service\n\nWhen tenants attempt to raise concerns, they are met with dismissive, rude, or evasive responses. Instead of providing solutions, management and staff avoid responsibility and treat tenants with contempt. This lack of accountability leaves tenants feeling powerless and unsupported.\n\n6. Lack of Tenant Protections\n\nOverall, Jopling House operates without regard for tenant protections. The combination of unjustified fines, unauthorized entry into units, poor amenities, and intentional cost-cutting at the expense of tenants demonstrates a clear pattern of neglect and abuse.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a disgraceful student accomodation and the staff lack any sense of decorum and manners, otherwise they would have addressed these issues in the last 2 years.",

There is a large larder fridge and freezer, dish washer, microwave, toaster and hot water boiler for instant hot water. The living area has a wood stove and the camp owners have mountains of wood to burn. There is both large and small fire pits, again, more than ample supply of wood to use. The field is large and we are able to have games if football, treasure hunts, rounders, water games etc. There is a small parking area at the entrance and enough space for around 6 cars outside of the lodge too. There is a marquee and a patio area and this is great for BBQ and outside activities if the weather lets us down as it offers a little bit of protection from wind. There are 9 bedrooms with bunk beds, sleeping up to 36 (8 X 4 and 1 X 2 rooms) and 2 rooms are slightly larger so can fit a blow up bed on the floor if needed. Camping is also an option. There is plenty of space, we regularly have 40+ people here, and are able to cater for them easily too. The shower facilities are also ample with 4 shower rooms all with toilets and an extra cloakroom. The heaters in all rooms are very good. All in all, we always have a great time and is great for getting the kids out in the fresh air. We are returning here nearer Xmas for our Xmas party.",

It felt more like a council run business, where you must do as you are told.

We have never been to such a run-down site but strangely there was over 40 permanent sited caravans and yet the site needs to be renovated.\n\nThe taps not in the shower rooms are the push sort but only last one second and are green with lime scale.  The taps in the shower rooms are the twist sort but are also green with lime scale and some are loose. Everything is rusting.  The sinks, shelves, shower traps and almost everything else is rusting. The extractor fans in the shower rooms didn’t work and as for the hand-dryer don’t bother.  Its rubbish.  They only seemed to but be cleaned on the weekend and then only bleach down the toilets.  There is only soap in the main area and not in the showers rooms which also contains the toilets.\n\nThe shop was never open but they only sold chocolate and cans of pop anyway.  The children’s play area is rusting to pieces and is falling apart. The track down to the park and around the park are full massive potholes.  It’s easier to drive on the grass. The washing up area only had two sinks which neither had plugs.  The grey disposal in that area smelt and had no pipe to rinse your waste container.\n\nI think there was a shooting range next to the site, there were constant bangs, so no good for dogs.\n\nThe website needs updating because now the electric on site is via a card meter.  There was never anyone on site at reception and so were given a mobile numbers to call if you needed help but it just rang and rang. We didn’t feel safe on site because according to one of the permanent sited caravan owners said that some gypsy’s were living on-site.  In fact one day a drunk man walked up to our car and had a good look inside and then wanted to see our caravan.  We left the next morning.\n\nI would not recommend this site at all, avoid!",

Whole site and facilities are immaculate it is very peaceful and ideal for those with dogs we took 2 labradors who thoroughly enjoyed walking in the woods and swimming in the river followed by a doggy ice cream everyday on the walk back. Every member of staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble.\nThe site got very busy one night and it was still silent and the facilities kept spotless. We enjoyed it so much we are booking up for a week in August. I would recommend studying the map first and choosing your pitch carefully, the one we had would have been extremely difficult to get out with a caravan in tow due to 3 motor home bays directly infront and a hilly area behind so reversing may have been tricky if fully booked. We are both coach drivers so very confident in manoeuvring around awkward spaces. A HGV driver next to us also said he noticed this immediately too. That is literally the only minor criticism everything was perfect and we can't wait to return.\nPlease try there fresh eggs and honey you won't get better anywhere!\nOverall if you want a adults only peaceful break away in stunning surroundings with spotless facilities this is definitely the place to book!",

I would recommend studying the map first and choosing your pitch carefully, the one we had would have been extremely difficult to get out with a caravan in tow due to 3 motor home bays directly infront and a hilly area behind so reversing may have been tricky if fully booked. We are both coach drivers so very confident in manoeuvring around awkward spaces. A HGV driver next to us also said he noticed this immediately too. That is literally the only minor criticism everything was perfect and we can't wait to return.\nPlease try there fresh eggs and honey you won't get better anywhere!\nOverall if you want a adults only peaceful break away in stunning surroundings with spotless facilities this is definitely the place to book!",

The water in the shower  operates on a push button and the shower to the left was awful, I needed my hand on the button  all the time. The shower on the right was slightly better but the water didn't run away in the shower tray which is disgusting.    There is barely any room to move in the shower and the place to put soap and shampoo etc is to small.  Showering  was not a pleasant experience.  As for the toilets  there was no toilet paper or soap left mid morning in either cubicle and the cleaner came in and didn't even bother to fill up the soap which is just gross and it was empty for 2 whole days.  Luckily I take my own paper and soap.\n\nThere are two dish washing sinks and these have very hot water but they arent always kept clean either.\n\nThe campsite is  sited right next to a really  busy road so depending on where you  pitch it could be noisy with the traffic. But also we  got the feeling that it was  a campsite people used  for work. It  cleared out really early from 7am  and then the same people came back later, so it was quite noisy when they left and came back.\n\nOn the plus side there is a cafe on site and a pop up bar with snacks every evening.  You can hire Fire pits for £7.50 a night and buy logs for £10 and there is  a lovely little dog walking area.\n\nI read reviews about  the site being noisy with people partying and it wasn't at all whilst we were there. I also read about there not being any dog walking from the site, there is if you look at the ordnance survey maps.  If you turn right out of the site and walk a short way along the road there is a track to your right,   follow the lane past the houses and through the  alpaca field  and there are lots of footpaths from here  including the 100 and The way of Love.  Additionally there is  a 30 minute walk to the Farmers Arms which is a pleasant little pub which does food and allows dogs inside too. And if you turn right and then left up the lane there is a lovely walk which takes you up to Cassop and a nice little pub there called P &K. They do food and let dogs in and very welcoming too.\n\nIt's a shame as this site has real  potential and could be really lovely.  But it is just lacking in it's  facilities.  There looks to be somekind of unfinished facility block on site, if these were finished and opened on this site it could be a game changer. But until then we wouldn't recommend it to anyone to  be honest.\n\nAnd this is a real & honest  review, I review all our campsites and I do it honestly, but we are all different and  have our likes and dislikes.  The facilities are what make or break a campsite for us. But if you like walking it's a great place",

It was lovely to hear children playing during the day, Ice cream van came in the afternoon, with a fish and chip van visiting on Friday's at 18.00. Good facilities, you might want non slip shoes if using the shower, available in the shop too. Other campers and caravan were friendly too.",

The facilities are really  good  and are kept very clean.  The  showers have lots of hooks, adjustable heat, lots of space  and the water is  very hot. There are 3 private basins and 4 clean toilets.   Very hot water for dishwashing.  There is a Laundry area  and chemical toilet disposal.  The pitches are spaced out nicely but most pitches  need levellers.  We were glad not to have been nearest the sea as this is close to the fence and the other side is the busy England Coast Path and it can be noisy and nosy. Nice location close to Whitley Bay so some lovely coastal walking and great beaches. Really enjoyed our time on this site.",

On arrival, we were told the dinner reservation had been changed as they were busy, when asking for an earlier time, staff were unaccommodating and repeated it was in the small print upon booking. The robes we were provided with had tears and stains on them. There was no spa music, and with the spa being busy, it felt as though we were in a leisure centre. Multiple showers had a lime scale, broken controls, and lights not working. There were drains with covers hanging off. There was no staff presence. Rubbish had been left around the pools and in the sauna / steam rooms. Guests were vaping in the outdoor pools. The restaurant was a good atmosphere and the meal was really nice. Although the service was slow when coming to pay the bill. On leaving the spa, staff did not ask how our experience was or even look up from the desk when speaking. We did not take many photos as don't  like to have phones in the spa. We would not recommend and will not be returning.",

Best time to go is mid-afternoon, but the chances are you’ll show up to a sign on the door saying it’s closed for another gala or swim club. Gym is always packed full after around 12pm, so again, good luck if you plan on going after work. If you like cycling, you’ll be okay because they have a LOT of bikes which are always empty, but everything else, like treadmills and spaces to stretch, you will have to stand around waiting for. If you come to the gym with a workout plan, you’ll probably leave without being able to do half of it because of how busy it always is. It really should be bigger for the amount of members there are. I had a nice time at the yoga class, so that is one plus to the membership. If there was another leisure centre with a pool in Durham city, I would move to it instantly. And on top of all that, the opening times are disappointing compared to other gyms, especially on the weekends. The prices are so high for the VERY small opportunity you get to use any of the facilities. For example, today the pool was open to the public for only 2.5 hours mid-afternoon; if you work a job, you’ll probably rarely get a chance to use the pool.",

The only facilities for me (a woman) to take my children are up two flights of stairs. My baby was in the pushchair and when I asked the receptionist how I was supposed to get upstairs with the pushchair while carrying my toddler she asked why didn’t the seat of my pushchair unclip. I even had offers from some lovely users of the pool to look after my toddler while I took the baby upstairs but I am not comfortable with leaving my child with a stranger. I was told I couldn’t use the pool changing as I can’t take the pushchair in there which makes it incredibly difficult to carry both toddler, baby and the nappy bag. I shouldn’t be made to feel that I cannot take two small children in nappies out to places by myself that are made for children and I find it hard to believe this has never been raised as an issue before.",

You get 50 minutes which starts as you enter the water and you get a coloured band. We did get the full 50 minutes. We could have had longer! The staff are lovely. The changing rooms were nice and clean. We parked on farmfoods which was very nearby as the car park was full. It does get busy inside but we only queued about 10 mins max for the slide. They rotate the slide and wave pool so you get to experience each about 3 times in the 50 minutes you’re there. They are bringing in booking but not for summer so if you want guaranteed entry without having to come back at a later time get there early for the first session is my advice. Or if you have to return there is a nice cafe with seating anyway.",

It’s a brilliant venue for energetic, fun-filled celebrations that the kids absolutely love — and it’s really well organised, which makes things so much easier for parents too.\n\nThere are plenty of party options available depending on what your child is into — from soft play and sports to swimming parties and bouncy castle setups. The facilities are modern, clean, and spacious, and the staff are great at making everything run smoothly. They take the stress off your shoulders and keep the children entertained and safe throughout the session.\n\nOne of the best things is how much space there is for the kids to burn off energy — it’s ideal for bigger groups and works really well no matter the weather. The birthday packages are also really good value, especially considering what’s included.\n\nThe team are friendly, helpful, and clearly experienced with running children’s events — they were always on hand to help with setup and keep things moving.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun, active, and affordable party option in the Spennymoor area, we’d definitely recommend Spennymoor Leisure Centre. The kids will love it — and so will you!",

You can never find a member of staff if you need to hire a towel or renew your membership etc...your left hunting the building as the owners have staff doing allsorts all to save a few quid. The equipment is very basic there is no real room for progression here, its just a bog standard gym for basic maintenance. With extremely high levels of chlorine in the pool. Always smells really bad....and on a morning its like a kiddies cresh so if you want to relax in sauna or jaccusi... find another gym.",

From the moment I stepped through the doors, I felt enveloped in a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nThe spa facilities were top-notch - the pool, sauna, and steam room were all immaculately clean and well-maintained. But what really stood out was the exceptional service from the friendly and attentive staff. They went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed, from fresh towels to refreshing drinks.\n\nI treated myself to a massage, and it was absolute heaven. The therapist was skilled, knowledgeable, and tailored the treatment to my specific needs. I left feeling like a new person - relaxed, rejuvenated, and ready to take on the world!\n\nThe gym and fitness facilities were also impressive, with state-of-the-art equipment and a great selection of classes. But for me, the real highlight was the spa's serene atmosphere and stunning views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nWhether you're looking to relax, unwind, or simply indulge in some me-time, Bannatyne Durham is the perfect destination. I'll definitely be back - and soon!\n\n*Highly recommended for:* Spa days, massages, relaxation, fitness, and stunning views!",

          "reviewText": "There’s nothing Spa Day or zen like about Bannatyne’s and we will be looking elsewhere in future. We arrived to a long line at the reception desk, no excitement or warm welcome for a Spa Day. £10 charge for bag, flip flops, towel and robe which is nonrefundable and towel & robe to be given back before exiting - after paying for the Spa day I think £10 each is excessive for a flimsy bag and those cheap flip flops. Robes were well used, not soft and on the small side. We were given an explanation of where everything was which was helpful. We were told to wait on the sofas near our treatment time in the cafe area - they have tried to make this section designated for Spa Guests with signs specifically stating this but we had to sit with 2 women eating food and a lone man reading a newspaper (maybe just the entitled older generation who just do what they want regardless of what the area is designated for) a member of staff from the cafe served the 2 women food whilst we were sat there in robes and I honestly think they should have been asked to move. It’s not fair to Spa Guests. The treatments and the girls who completed them were great. The treatments were relaxing and we enjoyed them - would have liked the room warmer but that is my only grumble for that. We moved to the relaxation room (comical name) with hot stone beds (some working, some not) and mood lighting but you couldn’t relax from all the external noise - doors banging, what sounded like a water/pump thing constantly going off, laughter and loud talking from reception area and others. Pool area was had what you would need, clean, able to use everything, apart from the 4 loungers as a group of four also having a spa day had placed their towels on them even though they weren’t using them and didn’t use them the full hour we were in using the facilities - this really should be monitored by staff to make it fair for all those having Spa Days - you aren’t on the bed and the towel is, it gets removed. Cafe was ok, clinical and not very relaxing/comfortable for a spa day, some good options but expensive. We wouldn’t return - I don’t think you can be both you’re either for fitness or for spa days - for the size of the area inside it doesn’t work for both especially where the relaxation room is located.",

I opted for a back massage, I asked the therapist for this to be firm pressure and she got this spot on, I could hear the knots being removed from my shoulders !\nThe facilities were very clean, the only negative comment would be the swimming pool was quite cold, as an ex swimmer, this wouldn't normally bother me but my mother in law did find it too cold and didn't last very long ago at all in the pool.\nThere appeared to be a good range of food and drinks on offer in the lounge cafe bar, the food we had was nice and appeared reasonably priced for the quality and portion size.\nI would recommend this for anyone looking for a spa day, although some facilities were not 'as fancy' in comparison to other spas on the area, I do feel this was reflected in the cost.",

The staff was friendly and welcoming, and they were happy to answer any questions I had about the center's amenities.\n\nThe pool itself is fantastic. It's a great size, and the water temperature is perfect for swimming. The pool area is also well-lit, which makes it easy to see where you're going and what you're doing. I especially appreciated the fact that there were plenty of lane markers, which made it easy to navigate around other swimmers.\n\nIn addition to the pool, the center offers a variety of other wellness amenities, such as a fully-equipped gym, a sauna, and a steam room. I really enjoyed the gym, which had a great selection of equipment and was kept very clean.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Hetton Community Pool and Wellness Center to anyone looking for a great place to swim, work out, and relax. The facilities are top-notch, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the sense of community is truly something special.",

There was no notice or way of knowing this when you booked the slot online.\n\nWhen we tried to leave a group of school kids came in for the lesson, they pushed past us and took every baby changing room and even adults shut the baby change doors on my infant 1 year olds face, members of staff and the school staff watched and awkwardly and did nothing. It took 20 minutes and a nice random elder lady to hold open a baby change door and shout for us.\n\nWhen we finally got inside the baby change room it was nothing lile the one we used on the way in, there was no water or handwash facility unlike the first and the room was also smaller. It was just a red plastic table with a small indent for a baby and a hole in the middle.\n\nWhen my child had a accident I was left in a small room with urine puddling on the floor bellow us and nothing to help me wash my child. I managed to wrap up all my things and move the the ONLY baby changing stall with running water then quickly leave.\n\nHaving 1 decent baby change room and 6 other basic rooms is not okay.\nStaff members and school staff watching as children and adults selfishly take baby change rooms because of the bigger size and push and shut doors in our face is not okay.\n\nNever bring your infant here.",

We had a lovely coffee from the on site catering van -highly recommend..\nWe returned today to try the restaurant and were not disappointed. We had really lovely meals. I can recommend the house salad ,it was not just a pile of lettuce leaves with the usual chunks of tomato and cucumber but a delectable plate of finely mixed ingredients and gorgeous dressing -well worth the price and even  though the restaurant was busy over the lunch time and had a 'kitchen crisis' it still felt very relaxing. The staff are amazing and seemed to be really enjoying their job...

These seemed fairly rudimentary and relatively few changing cubicles. Lockers available, although you'll need somewhere to store the locker key!

These seemed fairly rudimentary and relatively few changing cubicles. Lockers available, although you'll need somewhere to store the locker key! Showers lovely and warm.\nDeco cafe looked lovely, but was already full when we visited - obviously a popular spot!\nWould return again when restoration fully completed. Definitely one not to miss!",

I’m not sure the water temp was 22° as the sign stated? The pool, surrounding areas and changing rooms were spotlessly clean. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. I’d booked the 13:30 slot ( I was travelling North) but arrived earlier and was able to swim at the earlier time. The showers did take some time to run warm. A lovely cafe is next to the pool. After my swim I enjoyed a toasted sausage sandwich and coffee. Friendly staff here too! A fabulous asset for the town.",

For some of my most isolated clients, those little day to day interactions can be literally life saving.

Booked in advance via the everyone active app. Plenty of parking at the pool, which is free for up to 2 hours. Communal male (turn right from entrance) and female (turn left) changing rooms, which were clean but basic. Hot showers and clean toilets alongside lockers (50p refundable) available. The walk from the female changing rooms to the shallow end is a bit of a trek, so recommend taking sliders. The lane swim was a popular session, but the pool is so big that the lanes were generous (double width slow lane) so it didn't feel too crowded. Attentive life guards.

Lockers on-site for 20p, which I didn’t use as I had my bag near the pool.\n\nKids loved it.\nUnfortunately for me, a family of rude ‘knackers’ spoilt part of my enjoyment this time, but that’s no fault of the pool’s.\n\nI would return :)",

They used to be professional clean and hard working. However times have changed and not for the better..\n\nFirstly a thank you to JOEY always kind,helping, friendly and happy to see the patrons of the gym.\n\nHowever for the rest of them. The new cleaners moan on constantly about doing their job. Cleaning it's your job, don't like it get a different one, constantly in the mens locker room so you feel uncomfortable getting changed due to female presence in there. They have a bad attitude to the male members regarding a service they provide in the locker rooms.(the sauna) shutting down the shower facilities from 6 down to just 2 before 9pm. You have to wait for a hot shower if you dont time it right. Furthermore they remove the drain covers so you have to watch your step constantly so you dont fall in and do damage to your foot or ankle. Surely this is a health and saftey failure. Not to mention they stink of sewage when the covers are removed. The showers are not heat adjustable so always hot. Every patron i speak to when mentioned in conversation will mention the lack of a cold shower yet the managemt refuse to spend a little bit of money changing just one of the showers into a cold shower.(sunderland have this so why not washington) None of the floor staff do any 5S and the place is a free for all with weights and equipment just abandoned all over the gym. Its always messy and unhygienic due to the lack of cleaning equipment.(covid days where wipes and sanitiser was provided) like it used to be before going 24 hours.\n\nClasses have also became very limited in what they offer its a real shame for those who joined the gym for the classes once provided\n\nThe place is Full of steroids, women recording workouts and men who perve on every woman who enters the gym. Yes ladies everything you do the men are watching your arse or your chest! They are vile pervs,Old and young.\n\nThe place is full of squads of school kids\n\nStinks of weed coming from lockers in the locker room yet the staff do nothing about it.\n\nThe boxing area is atrocious. Soaking wet floor all of the time but hey ho a wet floor sign is good enough to cover the gyms insurance if anyone slips on it and breaks their neck. The staff sign off the hourly check sheet without batting an eye lid at the place. They allow members to kick the punching bags although it's against the boxing rules signage. This has lead to many hand injuries over the years from damaged bags. Since going 24/7 they have enclosed the boxing area so it no longer feels like part of the gym which causes the feeling of isolation and a prison like experience.\n\nIf you are working out during the night there is no locker rooms available and only a disgusting disabled toilet for all to use.\n\nThe drains stink\nThe staff are arrogant\nAnd I certainly won't be using JD gyms again 👋 no need for a reply from JD GYMS WASHINGTON im not interested in your response",

Despite having clearly set up equipment for myself, one individual jumped onto it, dislodging a weight which landed on my phone, leaving me feeling intimidated,  upset and frustrated. Staff later confirmed the incident via CCTV, acknowledged the behaviour, and even banned the individuals involved — implicitly accepting the behaviour and actions were unacceptable.\n\nDespite this, JD Gyms has completely refused to accept any responsibility. Their management has shown little interest in resolving the matter or even offering support. I was told to take it up with the individuals involved — rather than the gym recognising that they failed to enforce their own rules or provide a safe environment. Their attitude has been dismissive, evasive, and frankly disrespectful.\n\nThis isn’t just about a phone. It’s about how a business responds when a female member is made to feel unsafe, ignored, and passed around between managers who want to wash their hands of the issue. There was no apology, no accountability, and no effort to make things right — just an attempt to pass the blame.\n\nJD Gyms may have impressive equipment, but their attitude toward member safety and responsibility is seriously lacking. I wouldn’t feel comfortable recommending them to anyone who expects even basic standards of care, support, or professionalism when something goes awry.",

They vape openly, bring phones into the sauna to play music and watch TikTok, and leave rubbish scattered around without any consideration for others.

Useless and very unhelpful.\n\nThe hotel should also provide a map of the grounds. My room was hidden away in the rambling hotel grounds and badly signposted.\n\nThis Travelodge doesn't provide a hot breakfast. It's the only one I've been to like this. Perhaps there is low demand, but providing a decent breakfast should not be a matter of cost-benefit, but of providing a service to guests.\n\nThe bath needs a non-slip mat. Urgently. Especially as there is a high step up into the bath/shower. A warning sign isn't enough.\n\nThis Travelodge is designed for car travellers. I walked 1.5km up steep hills to get here from the railway station. It's also a long, steep walk to the nearest shop, a pub or a cafe/restaurant. There is an Italian restaurant on site, but it appears to be permanently shut.\n\nGood points: double glazing keeps the heavy traffic noise out.",

The pitches are a good size and the site is extremely clean.\nAs we had seen on previous reviews, the 2 porta loos and portable shower unit with 2 showers in, even though clean, let the site down. I'm glad our children are grown up, as I wouldn't have wanted to be 1 of the families in tents.\nMy other slight negative comment, is that we paid for a fully serviced pitch at £72 for 2 nights in total, but on arrival were told we had to turn the water off when not in use, it rained late on the first night, we really wouldn't have wanted to be going out to turn it on, to get a wash before bed, so we filled our water butt, not the best after what we paid.\nHaving spoke to the owner, we know they are in battles with their local council to get better facilities, so fingers crossed, as it does have the making of a higher star rating, sadly not just yet 🤞",

They keep the site so clean and tidy. Even gave us some menus to get a take away which was unreal too. Toilets are porta loos but have proper toilets in them and very clean. Showers and wash areas were constantly getting cleaned so were spotless. Each pitch  has their own electric point and water which is drinkable. And the WiFi is perfect. Didn’t go off once and all the kids had their iPads on on the night. Highly recommend this place and we’re already looking to book back up.
