Apart from Sydney & Budapest I cannot think of any other major city that offers such easy to access i.e. no membership required and centrally located pool in such a good and clean condition. Friendly staff. On my swim people were swimming at an appropriate pace for the lane speed. Being your own padlock, towel and shower gel.\nIt is becoming expensive though, seems a bit unjust that those who work and make an economic contribution pay twice as much as the unemployed and non working. For a tourist who loves to swim worth coming in for a few laps.",

At least the one I have put more hours into.\n\n- Despite the staff members have confirmed that cancelled classes are notified beforehand, there is a complete absolute absence of any kind of notifications when a class is in fact cancelled (no e-mail, no phone calls, no app notifications.

This is a fact that members of the team are aware of. Nobody cares or do nothing about it after several wakeup calls. They keep passing on the subject to other people but nothing happens.\n\n- When classes are apparently going to happen (nobody in reception says there is a cancellation and get the class ticket), MOST of the times (every single time in the last month and a half) fitness instructors are either missing, starting late and/or making up excuses for this vanishing. This has been told to superior members available at the time verbal complaint were held. Even so, big lack of seriousness and more excuses from them too. “We are waiting for a new instructor that is going to start this week”. Several weeks have gone by and the situation remains the same. The solution is easy: no staff available, no classes have to be scheduled.\n\n- Reception staff are normally exceeded by multiple tasks to do at once hence the customer service is far from appropriate. Also pointing out that there are some particular cases where no kindness to the client is shown at all.\n\n- Also, the state of the facilities is disgusting 7 of 10 times I go there. Everything is dirty, urine smell in the common areas, showers, pool area. That is the main reason I only went to the swimming pool twice.\n\nI ended up giving my notice to end my membership and my wife's via the online form but so you know and if you want to do the same, if you do it after the first of the month you will be charged one extra month by contract.\n\nDisgusting experience overall.",

However, my experience and the cleanliness was not up to par.\n\nWe came in to do gym and swimming today (Sunday) as a day pass and was greeted kindly by the gentleman at reception. My partner used the toilet but there was unfortunately no toilet paper. We went out to grab a swimming costume and returned about 20 minutes later. When we came back, there was no one at reception and we waited for over 5 minutes for someone to return. We explained that we had just bought a day pass, and the lady said ‘okay, I trust you’ and let us both through.\n\nWe started at the gym which had some faulty equipment. Both the hip abduction and the seated leg press were not working and could not be adjusted. However, apart from this, it seemed clean and the atmosphere was calm and enjoyable.\n\nMyself and my partner then went downstairs to swim. The changing rooms were dirty. There were flies, and used, bloody plasters, tissue on the floor. Despite this we swam for well over an hour and had a good time.\n\nHere’s the bad bit. We left the pool at around 4 o’clock and cooled off in the sauna for about 45 minutes. We went to have another shower and was then told that we only have 5 more minutes until the place closes. This was strange to me as online it said 6pm. My partner had my bags and our towels so I asked a member of staff if I could go into the group changing rooms with him and he was extremely confrontational and said ‘what’s wrong with the male and female ones?’. I then explained that I need to use his towel and he said that we could change in the sauna. I asked if someone would tell people not to come in and he said no.\n\nWe changed in the sauna anyway since it seemed easier. There was a faint, strange smell a bit like urine. We changed and kept an eye on the doors as each other was changing. He thought he dropped his airbud in between the wooden bench in the sauna, and as he looked with his phone flash light, he could see MAGGOTS all over the floor. Hundreds of them. We were both mortified and he was nearly sick.\n\nSo, the staff at the pool were quite rude and the cleanliness of the sauna was below hellish. It is insane how it’s still open. I told a member of staff but was not offered a refund or anything despite me saying how traumatic the sight was. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!",

However, apart from this, it seemed clean and the atmosphere was calm and enjoyable.\n\nMyself and my partner then went downstairs to swim. The changing rooms were dirty. There were flies, and used, bloody plasters, tissue on the floor. Despite this we swam for well over an hour and had a good time.\n\nHere’s the bad bit. We left the pool at around 4 o’clock and cooled off in the sauna for about 45 minutes. We went to have another shower and was then told that we only have 5 more minutes until the place closes. This was strange to me as online it said 6pm. My partner had my bags and our towels so I asked a member of staff if I could go into the group changing rooms with him and he was extremely confrontational and said ‘what’s wrong with the male and female ones?’. I then explained that I need to use his towel and he said that we could change in the sauna. I asked if someone would tell people not to come in and he said no.\n\nWe changed in the sauna anyway since it seemed easier. There was a faint, strange smell a bit like urine. We changed and kept an eye on the doors as each other was changing. He thought he dropped his airbud in between the wooden bench in the sauna, and as he looked with his phone flash light, he could see MAGGOTS all over the floor. Hundreds of them. We were both mortified and he was nearly sick.\n\nSo, the staff at the pool were quite rude and the cleanliness of the sauna was below hellish. It is insane how it’s still open. I told a member of staff but was not offered a refund or anything despite me saying how traumatic the sight was. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!",

I was informed that we'd need to wait 20 minutes for the next session. I did not mind waiting so paid £6 for me and my son. During the wait, there was an area selling crisps, drinks and snacks, unfortunately no one was at the till point. Staffing was short by the look of all areas from entrance to exit. The family leisure area was amazing, the slides and climbing areas were brilliant. The website and schedule needs adjusting to avoid confused customers.",

It’s an even better gym at a much lower price. The castle centre now wants £44 per month for a place with a long track record of being crap. Sure, it’s nice now, but it’s impossible to have any confidence it’ll remain that way. The gym group gym is £20 per month presently and has been as low as £15.\n\nThe issue with the Castle Centre gym is it's run by the council, so it's entirely focussed on people who don't pay to get in – the kind of people who break equipment – and sees anyone who does pay to get in as a sucker. They spent a month doing it up and didn't refund that month's membership fee, because that is how council people think. 'Hey just use the pool instead' (no thanks)  'or use our gym in Peckham' (definitely no thanks; it's like a prison gym.)\n\nNow they’ve socked up their pricing by 20%, starting from April. Yes, that’s right: twenty per cent.\n\nAnyway, for legacy reasons, here's the last update to my review of this place:\n\nTo my utter amazement, the gym here – previously a total dump – has been fully renovated and given all-new equipment to replace the malfunctioning, rusty crap they had before. I have to admit I’m seriously impressed.\n\nLet’s hope they can maintain it, and discourage the more moronic part of their clientele from misusing equipment in insane ways, which must have contributed to the dire state of the old equipment.\n\nPlease note, the lockers now require a padlock – the ones that used the old-style pound coins (not the current pound coin; that would be way too simple) have been replaced.",

If you go in there’s apparently no managers available, does this Rhonda even exist?! We get told she’s the only one that can issue refunds yet she never seems to be in, never replies to emails calls etc… Absolute shambles. Completely mismanaged. Other parents whose children attend swim lessons seem to be having the exact same issues too, and the funny thing is, they admit to other people having the same problems yet do absolutely nothing to solve them! 3 weeks and counting and still getting absolutely nowhere. Any other business triggers refunds automatically without people having to nag them to death! Cancel your memberships and move elsewhere like i’ve done, save yourselves the hassle of dealing with non existent managers, and swim lessons that don’t seem to advance.

I booked for a family swim but unfortunately my partner wasn't able to come into the pool as there's literally nowhere to park! The place is in such a horrible location and you wouldn't even find it unless you ask people walking by. It is in the middle of an estate with loads of flats around it. There's steps to get down to it which is not ideal when you have a pram.\nWe were late due to not being able to find it so instead of having 50 minutes in the pool we had about 20 minutes which made my kids really upset. For the actual leisure centre itself, upon arrival, we were told by the receptionist that the lights in the female changing room wasn't working so we walked into darkness and I am talking serious darkness. No light what's so ever. I have never seen darkness like that before. Imagine changing yourself, and 3 small children in complete darkness! not the one! they didn't even try to come up with a solution or even offer some money back for the inconvenience which I think is so wrong. It was just another thing on the list to ruin the experience. The actual pool itself was semi warm and the changing room which is the only positive I can say. It's fair to say that we won't be going back again as we didn't enjoy our family day and was such a waste of time and money. (Oh and also I had to pay for my 6 month old and 2 year old and 6 month old nephew. I'm not sure why they wasn't free like everywhere else. Online says juniors and doesn't give you the option to add in infants like everywhere else. It should come up as 'discount 5'. I had to call up first and the receptionist wasn't even sure himself and then just said maybe it's because of the area and they don't get anybody under junior year and the babies and 2 year old are classed as juniors. lol)",

Non-functioning showers in the male changing/unisex changing area is a HUGE turn off.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the pool is really clean and well managed. The pool is 30(perhaps 33?) metres in length, with the shallow end at 1 metre and deep end at 4 metre.

The other local pools are not a great alternative at the moment- Mile End is small and overcrowded. York Hall is out of use for several months due to structural work. London fields lido still has only outdoor changing-  no indoor changing or hairdryers so not suitable before work or for those who need a hairdryer and even if you can manage without that it’s difficult to book a slot peak time.. London aquatics centre has cleared the bulk of the daytime schedule in the 50m competition pool to run aqua splash and is now not open till late at weekends as it was pre-pandemic. Appreciate times are difficult but the community needs this place sorely and it should be a priority to get this place up and running again.",

It’s located at a very busy main road, so if you do drive to the gym, expect to walk a little to get to the gym. The showers were nice and hot too, so the experience was a pleasant one!",

I bought a day pass as I was traveling the next day. The cost was shocking! £25 for a single day pass! I pay this much at home for a month! I bit the bullet and paid it as I was commited due the the proximity of my hotel and lack of time to look for another gym. The gym was well furnished (machines, free weights, mats, etc) and the equipment was newer and in good shape. I worked out for 70 minutes and although it was a busy time (6:00pm), I was able to mostly get the equipment i needed when I wanted it. Plenty of benches and free weights available but machines quite busy. In addition to the cost, I wasn't pleased with the volume of the music. I could clearing hear the music from the ceiling mounted speakers the whole time even though I had earbuds in and my volume turned up high. Overall not a great experience.",

Yes it is small compared to the non-city centre warehouse style gyms but this is zone 1 in London and it definitely stands in line with most other local gyms. It has a great size gym floor stocked with continually renewed machines, a sprung floor studio plus spin studio. The changing rooms have newly installed saunas (yes they are small but they are proportionate) which is great after a session. The current management team are genuinely awesome.

It wasn’t the frequent locker break ins or thefts in the changing rooms that pushed me to this point. Unfortunately, it was the lack of basic gym etiquette from PT staff and management. Long term paying members are being moved out of spaces and off equipment with little notice to make room for classes.\nEvery gym I’ve ever trained in operates on a first come, first served basis for open areas, assisted machines and free weights but that was not respected today. I was removed from the gym floor to accommodate a class, and had this taken place in a studio, it would have been understandable. However, it didn’t, and this treatment is unacceptable. Sadly, based on this experience, I cannot recommend this gym to others.",

We feel it is important to raise serious concerns regarding the ongoing lack of hygiene and respect from certain individuals within the female changing room, sauna, and shower walkway facilities.\n\nOver the past several months, the situation has deteriorated to a point where many of us are now considering cancelling our memberships, despite being loyal members for years, some for over two decades.\n\nIt has become increasingly common to witness individuals using the sauna and steam room for activities that are entirely inappropriate and unhygienic. These include:\n\nScrubbing and exfoliating with body scrubs, which results in dead skin cells and debris being spread throughout the saunas and shower walkway.\n\nClipping fingernails and toenails within the sauna and shower areas.\n\nMost shockingly, brushing teeth in the sauna, which leads to saliva and foam being splattered around, creating an extremely unhygienic and unpleasant environment.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable in a professional fitness club environment and is highly disrespectful to other members.\n\nWe kindly urge the management to take immediate action to address this issue. Specifically, we request:\n\nClear and prominently displayed signage in and around the changing rooms, sauna explicitly stating that scrubbing, exfoliating, nail clipping, and tooth brushing are strictly prohibited.\n\nRegular staff monitoring of these areas to ensure compliance and to maintain appropriate hygiene standards.\n\nWithout decisive action, many of us feel we will have no choice but to terminate our memberships. It would be deeply disappointing to have to leave after so many years, but the current state of affairs is unacceptable and poses genuine hygiene concerns.\n\nWe sincerely hope you take this matter seriously and implement these changes.",

At time when so much is being automated to save on costs (understandable), I hope Better recognises how much value that one staff member, is adding to the community of Lido users (and therefore to Better as an organisation).",

Greeted with a warm welcome by the lady on the desk, clean and modern changing rooms inside and out, warm showers and a spotlessly clean pool in beautiful surroundings. Enough room poolside to relax for a bit if you want to as well and even though I went on a hot day when it was busy, it never felt too crowded. It also showed a true cross-section of society and was clearly being used by locals, with people of all ages, genders and races, which was super refreshing and gave a wonderful vibe. Big shout out to the staff who made my first visit so wonderful. 🥰🌟",

Benches are available near the small café at one end. On hot days, the café can get extremely busy with long queues, and there may also be queues for the toilets. The toilets are a little run down, and the shower facilities are in a shared space.\n\nI also want to mention that the lockers are somewhat unreliable. They’re small, require your own padlock, and while they’ve worked for me in the past, today I found I could pull mine open without much effort even with the padlock secured. They’re showing their age and could do with upgrading.\n\nThat said, it’s still a wonderful lido — so much so that we’re happy to travel 1.5 hours across London just to get there!",

It’s not you have to use a chair lift which is a big song a dance to use and draws way too much prying eyes. You have to go up and down stairs in a stand chair lift which draws a lot of attention from others attendants. Terrible. The people working in this gym including management and better regional managers need training on how to communicate and treat those that are disabled regardless of how one “looks” to you.

Heading a party of five on such a busy night can sometimes be a gamble, but Lido delivered an absolute masterclass in Cantonese cuisine.\n\nA Trip Down Memory Lane\nLido holds a special place in my heart; it’s the oldest Chinese restaurant in London, established in 1969. I first visited back in the 1980s during my student days, and stepping back inside felt like a warm homecoming.

Heading a party of five on such a busy night can sometimes be a gamble, but Lido delivered an absolute masterclass in Cantonese cuisine.\n\nA Trip Down Memory Lane\nLido holds a special place in my heart; it’s the oldest Chinese restaurant in London, established in 1969. I first visited back in the 1980s during my student days, and stepping back inside felt like a warm homecoming. While many places in the area have changed hands or lost their soul, Lido has maintained that authentic, vibrant atmosphere that makes Chinatown so iconic.\n\nThe Food: Fresh, Generous, and Perfect\n\nThis was, without exaggeration, the best Chinese food I’ve had in a very long time.

The manager did not allow me to get the refund although I clearly stated that I only want to use the pool. The showers are badly maintained and are very moldy.",

But the quality you get does not match the price tag. There are so many other better options in the area. The manager did not allow me to get the refund although I clearly stated that I only want to use the pool. The showers are badly maintained and are very moldy.",

Why am I being penalised for having an allergy!!! Please stop this outdated policy!\n\nOverall the gym is friendly enough (I’ve met one or two aggressive/cocky people since I joined 5 months ago) and most equipment is decent condition.

The reason for the 4 star is because of the constant blocked drains in shower room. I previously would shower in the gym after workouts now I avoid the showers. The water does not go down and other shower cubials are flooded with your dirty water when showering. To be fair this has been an ongoing problem for years which seems to have got worst. The upstairs part of the gym has a greenhouse effect because of the slanted glass window. Right now in the summer on hot days, upstairs is like a sauna it's unbearable. The heat also generates to downstairs. The AC half the time doesn't even feel like it's on. At times it's like working out in the Sahara Desert. I think these issues need to be looked at, as it is a lovely gym.",

There’s a lot of space in this gym which is nice, but it really could do with more kit - there’s room for at least 4 more benches and 3 or 4 more cable towers, the 3 there are simply not enough and are falling apart. Really needs some upgrade to the cable attachments too, PureGym does way better in that department - get some EZ bar attachments and lat attachments without the terrible rubber grip. The gym is reasonably clean (a few patches of water about…not sure why) but signs, especially the big G sign, are covered in dust. Lockers need benches by them in the corridor.\n\nThis is a shame, clearly a new gym for the area and the kit that is there is decent but it really needs and could definitely fit more kit. I understand you don’t want to overfill a gym but it’s far from that. There’s potential but I wouldn’t recommend this gym right now.",

So while there may still be queues at 6-8pm on a Monday (I stopped going at that particular day and time after taking the photo below), it’s generally just acceptably busy.\n\nFrom looking at the stats, I’d suggest this is still the busiest central-ish London gym operated by this brand but it’s also large and well managed, with a clientele who are serious about fitness but not dicks about it. It’s not an intimidating place.\n\nThe weights areas has been rearranged a few times and now has about as safe, logical and efficient a layout as the available space will allow.\n\nThere are more than enough cardio machines.\n\nI still think they’ve gone too big on the functional fitness/box fit/floor exercise area. As a result, when there’s not a hyrox class on, it looks pretty empty. You’ve got about one third of the gym  housing 6-10 people doing stuff like standing on one leg or pushing a box or hitting a punchbag. And another area of roughly the same size has WAY more people jammed in to use free weights, racks and resistance machines. But clearly that’s not going to change so I’ll just have to suck it up.\n\nCompared to most gyms I’ve been to, equipment is in a good condition, well maintained, and repairs are prompt when things break down. Although since it’s only been open 6 months, that is what you’d hope/expect.\n\nGroup activities are very popular and seem well run. I haven’t actually joined any of them so can’t really comment beyond that. Staff are friendly and helpful enough, no complaints there. My previous gym was the Castle Centre, where the staff largely acted like they hated you.\n\nThe Gym Group’s ‘high security’ door entry system is like something from a 70s sci-fi horror movie – or, more specifically, the video for the Buggles’ hit ‘Video Killed the Radio Star’. You get shut in a sinister glass tube, to prevent double shuffling, only being allowed out after what can feel like an uncomfortably long time. But to be honest, I got used to it and I expect you will too.\n\nEntry is via a QR code, or you can manually enter a 9-digit PIN instead. I suspect the latter is adding to the numbers using the gym, thanks to the miracle of PIN sharing. Call it a hunch.\n\nAt super-busy times, queues can result because neither entry method is what you’d call instantaneous, you have to do it to get out as well as to get in, and there are only two doors. Ideally, they need a third door.\n\nMaybe it’s just me though – I HATE queuing, whereas I know that for most British people, it’s basically the nation’s favourite pastime. 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nThe changing rooms are pretty tiny but I don’t think this will be a problem as most of the clientele will be hyper local and will change/shower at home. There are some complaints about theft in other reviews but I’ve seen no evidence of that. In fact, what I find mind-blowing is that most people here seem more than happy to leave their stuff in lockers they don’t even bother to padlock. So presumably it’s not a crime hotspot by any means.\n\nAnyway, some minor nitpicking aside, this is a really excellent gym, especially if you’re able to go before 5 or after 8, or on evenings other than Monday to Wednesday. It’s both the best gym in the immediate area and also the cheapest, which is a hard combination to argue with. It’s also way nicer than the other Gym Group gym down Walworth Road.",

There are no wipes/disinfectant. Given the high volume of people some of the machines are left covered in sweat which is gross. Additionally,  my hands felt very grimy after using some equipment so a mid routine hand wash is usually needed. I've had to bring my own wipes to combat this.\n2. The number of people training in this gym is ridiculous. There needs to be some cap on memberships. I had over an hour wait time for the smith machine which left me incredibly frustrated and not able to finish my workout. People are continuously asking others how many sets they have left or to work in. I have no problem with this usually, but it happens so frequently that you constantly have to plan ahead to figure out how you can even get your workout done. To add to that, when people work in, there's no way to clean the equipment. Things feel very close quarters when everybody is standing around the same piece of equipment for ages. This also means some exercises are more difficult to get done, like when you need to use both sides of the cables.\n3. After setting up a direct debit I was locked out of the gym. There is no reception to sort this out. I didn't know what had happened and spent over 30 minutes ringing the bell at the front to just get in to talk to a member of staff. While the member of staff was lovely and allowed me to workout they couldn't help with my issue. This was Friday evening and I had to ring the company to sort it out. I couldn't then get into the gym until the Tuesday as it was a bank holiday and there was no other way around this. The worker on the phone did fix the issue very quickly, but after paying the first month and joining fee only three days before, to get locked out because I had to choose a different card to pay the following month's membership seemed extreme and badly run. As a result, I missed a whole bank holiday weekend. I was unwilling to go to the gym to sort it out with staff due to the long wait to get in Friday night. I understand the business model of not having a reception but it can cause more issues than it's worth.\n4. The equipment while new, is not great. There is only one cable machine row which also has a lat pull down attached which I never even got to try since there was always somebody on it. The other lat pull downs are cheaply designed. You cannot get full range of motion as there is a stopper on the cable so when you pull it down towards you, at the moment you're about to get maximum benefit, the bar cannot be lowered anymore. Some machines have an extra small incremental weight you can slide on, but the bar is warped on some meaning there is no option to remove this, making it difficult to choose a suitable weight and having to find workarounds.\n5. There is no atmosphere in the gym. Big groups of people stand around talking, the changing rooms are uninviting (I don't think I've seen anybody use the showers), the in and out door system where you have to stand in a tube is ridiculous and results in queues of people trying to get out. It makes me feel like I'm a tiny bug trapped in a test tube. Weights are left on machines, people have poor gym etiquette, overcrowded, machines are dirty and people are always hawk eye waiting for machines to come free or standing over you waiting for your to finish your sets.\n\nChanges:\n1. There NEEDS to be wipes/disinfectant, machines with sweat marks are not acceptable.\n2. They need at least one (ideally two) more cable machines. Need another smith machine and change some of the lat pull downs.\n3. Limit the number of people who can join in a month.\n4. Need a member of staff monitoring the floor and cleaning machines.\n\nIf you casually go to the gym and have a very flexible workout regime then this gym is good value.

          "reviewText": "The Gym Group in Stepney Green has become my go-to workout spot, and not just because it’s only a short walk from the station. It’s open 24/7, which means I can fit in a session whether I’m up early or working late. The space is bright, clean, and well laid out, with plenty of cardio machines, free weights, and resistance equipment. Even at peak times, I rarely have to wait long for the kit I want.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is how beginner-friendly it feels. There’s no intimidating “gym bro” atmosphere here—people tend to be focused on their own workouts, and the staff are friendly and approachable. I’ve had quick, helpful chats about how to adjust machines or improve my form, which made me feel more confident using the equipment.\n\nThe changing rooms and showers are kept in good condition, and the lockers are big enough for a backpack. It’s also great value for money, with flexible no-contract memberships. My only small gripe is that the free weight area can get a bit crowded in the evenings, but that’s to be expected in London.\n\nOverall, Stepney Green’s Gym Group delivers exactly what I need: affordable, accessible fitness in a welcoming space.",

You can take breaks anytime you like.\n\nI have found all the trainers at the gym have different qualities. They all focus on different parts so you have a lot of variety to choose. Although all trainers are best but I found JD and Nelson the best with their welcoming and approachable nature.\n\nAlways try to book JD's body conditioning exercise earlier as it always fully booked.\nAnd never skip Leo's HIT exercises who always comes with great varieties of exercises to lose weight.\n\nAnd this gym can't be the best with out the cheerful people coming in the gym. I have made great work out friends here and always look forward to have a great workout session. Everyone is so helpful and keep look out for others.\n\nThis gym deserve 5 star but unfortunately the female bathroom and change room has let me down. I have found the toilets always dirty, broken and wet floor. The entire changing room stinks as soon you would enter which am sure management would look into.\n\nI have called various time to manage my membership over the phone and always spoke with friendly and helpful team.  It would be really helpful if the gym also let us book by selecting a date to start so this would give us more freedom.\n\nGym lockers should be allowed to use overnight as we bring gym accessories which sometimes hard to take it back as they are heavy.

Lots of young members with their tripods you often trip over their camera sticks.\nGym doesn’t provide any hygiene stations to wipe down or clean equipment.\nMembership includes 2 hr free parking in the chimes takes about. 10 m to walk there and walk back. Come before 8am and you can park on the high street or outside.\nStaff could definitely work harder in cleaning up, you often see the cleaning paper on the wall signed off with all the hours ticked off up to 10am slot when it’s only 7am.\nMale bald head worker comes across quite creepy approaching all females and making unneeded comments.\n247 toilet has been out of order this week which has been FOUL how can you expect anyone let alone a female no toilet space to urinate during a workout !\nToilets super foul see photo and this is ladies toilets?

Also additional attachments for cable machines would be useful like a v bar.\nWhen machines are broken they are fixed in a good amount of time.\nFunctional area for sled push included with variety of kettlebell.\nGood array of cardio machines and a woman’s only section. Woman’s only section has all the old equipment and DB up to 10kg.\nMember etiquette could be improved no one deracks and staff don’t bother cleaning up so you find equipment everywhere in random places can be really frustrating. Lots of young members with their tripods you often trip over their camera sticks.\nGym doesn’t provide any hygiene stations to wipe down or clean equipment.\nMembership includes 2 hr free parking in the chimes takes about. 10 m to walk there and walk back. Come before 8am and you can park on the high street or outside.\nStaff could definitely work harder in cleaning up, you often see the cleaning paper on the wall signed off with all the hours ticked off up to 10am slot when it’s only 7am.\nMale bald head worker comes across quite creepy approaching all females and making unneeded comments.\n247 toilet has been out of order this week which has been FOUL how can you expect anyone let alone a female no toilet space to urinate during a workout !\nToilets super foul see photo and this is ladies toilets? Other image shown staff lying about their checks and the times their signing off interesting DB signing off at 8:05 when it isn’t even 7am yet ?\nAlso some members have mad BO.",

          "reviewText": "Absolutely loved this gym, but after being a member for over two years there are a few things over the last year that definitely need improving. The air conditioning is not great. The gym gets extremely hot in the summer which isn't ideal at all. Broken equipment sometimes takes a long time to fix. There have been issues with soap and toilet paper running out in the changing rooms.  There are no cleaning stations on the gym floor so if equipment is left covered in sweat there is no way to clean it off. Not many rubbish bins around so people leave  rubbish on the treadmills rather than find a bin. The cleaner can be cleaning around you on the gym floor, but usually just hoovering (sometimes between your legs when you're mid set which is a bit odd!) Lots of weights not put away and can be left all over the place. Looking a bit tired in places and some equipment needs refreshing. The good points are nice members, the size of the gym, free parking and the overall amount of equipment available especially when it's all working. Overall I still love the gym but there are a few frustrations.\n\nI believe there is a manager now so hopefully things will improve again 🙏",

For the amount of men members that attend the gym, this is not enough! They should really think about getting more cubicles installed! 2nd issue with the mens changing rooms is that I think there is a drainage issue because sometimes it really smells like a used and abused toilet in there! 3rd issue with the mens changing rooms is that there are 5 showers and only 1 of them has a good water pressure! The other 4 have low water pressure! Another issue with the mens showers is that when you use furthest left or right shower, the sensors for the lights must not reach them as it goes dark quite quick and you can only get them to come back on by left the shower and the sensor picking up your movement! The showers could get a better clean too! There are also a lot of lockers which don't work!\n\nAnother issue is that most of the time, there is one or more bits of equipment broken and it takes a while until they're repaired! Considering that they have raised the money on quite a few occasions since it changed from Exercise for Less to JD GYM, they should really priorities getting equipment fixed quicker and to be honest, more equipment!\n\nAnother issue I find when it comes to the winter and the summer. They won't put any heating on over the winter and they rarely put the Aircon on over the summer.\n\nI think if the price ever reached £30 or more for a month, I would leave and find a new gym!",

Everything was fine even if there were few equipment like the punching bag, jumping box etc… for athletes it was still perfectly fine even the studio clubs which actually helped a lot of people to keep pursuing their goal was good enough it also provided females a private work out session free of men it in fact it was a big shot the studio in general. but now..???? Wth is going on??",

Went twice and I shall not be returning, even at a quiet time at 5am it still wasn’t worth it. I’m usually not fussed about showering at a gym, but this place is a no go zone. I can’t believe JD have attached their name to these abysmal location and equipment, disgusting. It wouldn’t surprise me if Covid originated from this disgusting place.

If the gym insists on taking on so many members then it must keep up with hiring more cleaning staff and providing more sprays and towels to clean equipment. There is none provided in the women’s section for members to wipe down their machines. The toilets are dirty with sanitary towel bins overflowing and the soap dispensers empty of soap most of the time. The hairdryers I doubt are ever wiped clean as they feel greasy to even touch, and the matts in the women’s area are often dirty and muddy.

The smell hits you the moment you walk in, and there's just no escaping it. It's like there's zero ventilation. The floors are always wet, the sinks are busted, the soap dispensers are always empty, and don't even get me started on the mess – it's like nobody ever bothers to clean up after themselves. Plus, half the lockers are busted or missing doors, which is just inconvenient and makes you worry about the security of your stuff.\n\nI want to give credit where it's due – the staff are really friendly and helpful. They're always there to lend a hand or offer advice. But unfortunately, their positive attitude can't make up for the fact that the gym itself feels like it's falling apart. The equipment is getting old and worn out, and it seems like nobody's bothering to maintain it properly.\n\nSo, as much as I hate to say it, JD Gym just isn't cutting it for me anymore.

You’ll need a padlock you can’t have bags on the floor - buy one in the vending machine for okay price. Changing rooms really good. Sauna a bit odd, you all kind of sit in a glass box and stare out at everyone … no they are not mixed there is one in each changing room. Staff seem cool. It smells so new. Downstairs is Hammer Strength machine heaven. Upstairs is cardio and Matrix kit - the newer stuff. It’s well lit inside considering no windows or natural light source. Music is okay from considerable speaker system. Parking - good luck with that! And when leaving the tricky road layout is a white knuckle logic test for sure.

Also why would I go to the gym if I cant shower after, like come on i dont wanna go home in my sweaty clothes.\n\nWill say the changing rooms otherwise are pretty good, most of the showers have hooks and shelves.\n\nAlso ive come to find its a bit nasty, hard to actually find a spay and paper towls to wipe down equipment with unlike other gyms. Its basic curtesy to do so but i feel id have to bring my own in to do so.\n\nYou have to ask staff if you want to go in more than once in a day (let's say you left something in your car for example) not to mention the full dependency on your phone, I swear there is basically no number option so if your phone is dead better hope someone is on staff.\n\nSadly I'll be going to another gym after trying this one out a second time now, to sadly find it hasn’t improved at all.",

          "reviewText": "Having read other reviews and being a regular user of this gym I had to add my comments.\n\nThe good points - cost, some of the staff are friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nThe negatives - some of the members are a problem with their disgusting habits.   The changing rooms are too small and when busy it's not a pleasant experience at all.  Too many members treat it like their own bathroom.  I've seen people shaving at the sink in the toilets, trimming their beards and nostrils in front of the mirrors.  Gross - where's the hair going?  I don't go to the saunas, again there are members who think it's fine to use them wearing boxer shorts.\n\nI try to use the showers as little as possible, they often stink, and people make some weird noises showering.  Best just shower at home if that's possible.\n\nIn short the changing area merits a 1/5 score.  They are gross and cramped.\n\nThe gym itself is largely ok.  As other reviews have stated there really should be some cleaning equipment.  I saw the business response saying they were from covid.  If your members want the option to clean equipment before or after use then you should accommodate that regardless, I think it's just a cost cutting measure that these are no longer available.  Especially important considering numerous reviews question hygiene and cleanliness.\n\nThe gym itself is a touch overcrowded.  I don't dare go after 4pm as it's far too busy.   I've spoke to other members who feel the same.\n\nSome equipment is under high demand.  Some days it can be quite frustrating trying to use what you want to.  Doesn't help when some staff and gym goers pair up using a machine then do 4+ sets.\n\nAs at January 2025, there are getting to be too many people filming their workouts now.  Again if it's not staff producing content for their Instagram (which I can understand to an extent) more and more regular gym users are doing this now too, it's getting a bit much.  Does noone just workout and not film themselves these days?\n\nLastly.  Far too many gym users don't put equipment away after use.  For example leaving benches at cables machines and squat racks for other users to have to move.    Similar with weights, these are left all over the place, or everywhere except where they are supposed to be.\n\nChanging area is often soaked as sauna users walk barefoot thru changing room or do what the guy in picture is doing and cool off on the benches.  Ends up with floor being wet and all the seats being wet.\n\nRecently changed the layout.  Spacing of equipment has got worse.  I should probably collect a wage from this gym from the amount of weights I have to find, return etc.\n\nAlso worth noting - if you wish to cancel they ask for 30 days notice and will refer you to debt companies if you cancel the direct debit.  You have to contact them by email and they are very slow to respond. I've contacted them twice and they will take at least 2 weeks to reply. Having said that I received a satisfactory outcome to my email request so that's one slight positive.",

          "reviewText": "Having read other reviews and being a regular user of this gym I had to add my comments.\n\nThe good points - cost, some of the staff are friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nThe negatives - some of the members are a problem with their disgusting habits.   The changing rooms are too small and when busy it's not a pleasant experience at all.  Too many members treat it like their own bathroom.  I've seen people shaving at the sink in the toilets, trimming their beards and nostrils in front of the mirrors.  Gross - where's the hair going?  I don't go to the saunas, again there are members who think it's fine to use them wearing boxer shorts.\n\nI try to use the showers as little as possible, they often stink, and people make some weird noises showering.  Best just shower at home if that's possible.\n\nIn short the changing area merits a 1/5 score.  They are gross and cramped.\n\nThe gym itself is largely ok.  As other reviews have stated there really should be some cleaning equipment.  I saw the business response saying they were from covid.  If your members want the option to clean equipment before or after use then you should accommodate that regardless, I think it's just a cost cutting measure that these are no longer available.  Especially important considering numerous reviews question hygiene and cleanliness.\n\nThe gym itself is a touch overcrowded.  I don't dare go after 4pm as it's far too busy.   I've spoke to other members who feel the same.\n\nSome equipment is under high demand.  Some days it can be quite frustrating trying to use what you want to.  Doesn't help when some staff and gym goers pair up using a machine then do 4+ sets.\n\nAs at January 2025, there are getting to be too many people filming their workouts now.  Again if it's not staff producing content for their Instagram (which I can understand to an extent) more and more regular gym users are doing this now too, it's getting a bit much.  Does noone just workout and not film themselves these days?\n\nLastly.  Far too many gym users don't put equipment away after use.  For example leaving benches at cables machines and squat racks for other users to have to move.    Similar with weights, these are left all over the place, or everywhere except where they are supposed to be.\n\nChanging area is often soaked as sauna users walk barefoot thru changing room or do what the guy in picture is doing and cool off on the benches.  Ends up with floor being wet and all the seats being wet.\n\nRecently changed the layout.  Spacing of equipment has got worse.  I should probably collect a wage from this gym from the amount of weights I have to find, return etc.\n\nAlso worth noting - if you wish to cancel they ask for 30 days notice and will refer you to debt companies if you cancel the direct debit.  You have to contact them by email and they are very slow to respond. I've contacted them twice and they will take at least 2 weeks to reply.

I didn’t used to like it much because the potholes were big enough to take your tyre of its rim and I dread to think how many were and how the Miriad of delivery mopeds coped. The certainly didn’t need traffic calming measures but guess what? They had the biggest road humps I think I’ve ever seen.\nAnyway thank the gods all those problems have gone. Tarmac is good and smooth and the traffic humps are normal. The most used part of the services are always the toilets and these are placed through the front entrance and down to ,the right. There is a Game Zone on the corner. Due to it being just below ground level the are both a few steps and a ramp for the less mobile of us. Toilets are fine with the weird Dyson hand driers stolen from scooter handlebars but they work great despite that. Coming out of the “Loo’s “ there is a Waitrose and then WH Smith’s on your right and then round to the left you have Subway and then Burger King. To finish the food and drink there is a Starbucks as you come in the Services entrance who have a sit in and an outside seating area for when it’s nice weather. Outside there is a washing machine pod where you can wash upto 20kg  (or so the sign says).\nThere are 24 Tesla superchargers then 4 Grid serve chargers by the walkway to the entrance and all round the outside left of the car park (with your back to the entrance) there are 24 charging points, but I’m not sure of the company who operates them,",

I grabbed a tuna pitta wrap from Pret A Manger, fresh, decent quality, and a nice change from the usual greasy options.\n\nThere are plenty of places to eat here, including Burger King, KFC, Subway, PizzaExpress, Taco Bell, Costa, and Starbucks (there's even a drive-thru). You’ll also find a WHSmith, Krispy Kreme, and a small Waitrose if you need to stock up on snacks or drinks. So whether you’re after fast food, coffee, or something a bit lighter, there’s a decent range of choices.\n\nThe car park is big and easy to navigate. There are separate areas for cars, lorries, coaches, and caravans, which helps keep things organised. Parking is free for the first two hours, but if you stay longer, it gets pricey — £15 for up to 24 hours. Definitely something to keep in mind if you're planning a longer break.\n\nFacilities are generally clean and up to date. It’s one of the better stops for electric vehicle drivers, with a large selection of EV chargers including GRIDSERVE, Applegreen, and Tesla. Inside, there’s also a Ramada hotel, showers, and even a small gaming area.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for something a bit more relaxed, there are a couple of pubs in the nearby village of South Mimms, like The Black Horse and The White Hart. They’re not far and might make a nicer stop if you’re not in a rush.\n\nOverall, South Mimms isn’t anything special, but it’s convenient, has a wide range of food options, and decent parking. Not bad at all for a quick break on a long drive.",

I will add two more stars fot that",

It turned out to be one of the better service stations I’ve visited. The toilets were spotless, with plenty of cubicles available even during a busy afternoon, which made the stop quick and convenient.\n\nThere’s a good range of food options including Burger King, Subway, and KFC, along with a well-stocked WH Smith for snacks, magazines, and travel essentials. The EV charging area was easy to find and worked smoothly, though it’s worth checking availability ahead if you’re stopping at peak times.\n\nParking is free for the first two hours, which is perfect for a short rest or a quick meal. I also appreciated the step-free access and other accessibility features, which make the site welcoming for everyone. The green frontage and small water feature give it a relaxed, open feel—nice to unwind for a few minutes before getting back on the road.\n\nOverall, this service area is a clean, comfortable, and well-equipped stop for anyone driving along the M40. Whether you’re recharging your car or yourself, it’s a sound choice with everything you might need. Just plan a bit of extra time if you’re depending on EV chargers or particular restaurants during rush hours.",

The place is clean, bright, and even has a free piano you can tinkle on while taking a break. The food court offers something for every craving: KFC, Burger King, Subway, Chopstix, and the bright The Good Breakfast breakfast bar (step‑free access and all – ideal for stretching your legs)  . If you're in the mood for coffee, there’s both a Starbucks inside and a separate Drive‑Thru, plus a Taco Bell that opened in March 2025. And for a slightly more upscale sit‑down, there’s a PizzaExpress and a good-sized Waitrose & Partners for everything from grab‑and‑go sandwiches to snacks  . Between those options and WHSmith, Krispy Kreme, and the petrol forecourts, it really does feel like a small food village on the motorway.\n\nFrom my point of view, it’s one of the best service‑station experiences on the M40. You’ve got the classics—KFC, McWhopper‑style flame‑grill from Burger King, Subway subs—plus hot‑food diversity with Chopstix noodles and Taco Bell’s new menu. I particularly enjoyed the sit‑down at PizzaExpress; it felt like a proper break rather than just refuelling. The two hours free parking, clean baby‑change areas, EV chargers, showers, and a Ramada hotel on‑site make it practical for any kind of stop—whether it’s a quick food run or a short-freshen‑up break. I’ll definitely be adding this to my travel rota—I’d rather stop here than settle for a rushed snack at a less appealing service station.",

          "reviewText": "Had a very pleasant 2 night stay in the female only dorm here which was perfect for my trip to London. I've never had a bad experience in a YHA and this hostel was no exception.\n\nThe main reception which doubles as a lounge is full of light and has a fun, relaxing vibe to it. I was warmly welcomed by the staff when I arrived around 10pm and they were ready with suggestions on things to do in London (you also get discounts if you book attraction tickets at their main desk). You can get a proper barista coffee or Yorkshire tea at reception, or have a beer (they stock Camden hells). They have a self catering kitchen as YHAs do, and you can also buy food at the hostel, although I didn't use it on my trip. Free filtered water at reception.\n\nThey have a lift and entry to the stairs going to the bedrooms was key card controlled, as is every room and dorm. I felt very safe. The dorms have spacious boxes under the bed that can be locked, one for each person in the room (bring a padlock) and I was able to fit a carry on inside. Beside each bed is a bedside lamp, power outlet and small shelf big enough to put your glasses on and phone. Each dorm also has coat hangers and pegs to put your coats. The rooms are clean, with fresh sheets and duvet etc. and the shared shower and toilets outside the dorm were spotless (lovely powerful shower!). I rented a huge towel from reception for a very reasonable £2.50\n\nThe only comment I have about the rooms are they are very hot even with the window open, I think because of how close they are to the showers which is not something the hostel can control. But having encountered this before in other hostels round the world I came prepared.\n\nFinally the location is excellent, easy to get to from Euston and very close to tube stations and Regents park. The area felt safe at night and it was very easy to find my way back - if you get lost, follow the BT tower and you'll be in the right neighbourhood in no time!\n\nI met some great people in this hostel and had a brilliant time! I would definitely return.",

For a hostel it was quite clean, people were quite respectful too. i made some good friends and joined in on group activities and had so much fun! The showers dont have any shelves or baskets or ledges to set your toiletries, so make sure you have a bag of some sort since there are 2 hooks on the walls. storage baskets were a tad noisey but i had no issues since my roommates and i were all considerate with our noise and we all woke up/slept around the same time. staff are super friendly and anthony took a group of us out to a pub! location is right in central which was really nice. overall it was my first hostel experience, im a big germaphobe and managed just fine so would definitely recommend!",

          "reviewText": "This hostel is more than suitable for a short stay with good transport access. I stayed 4 nights in a 4-bed female dorm, and while it’s not the nicest one I’ve been to, it provided me with the bare minimum of a clean bed to rest my head. Additionally, having a basin with a soap dispenser in my room was very convenient as I didn’t have to worry about waiting to use a sink in the communal bathrooms. Staff are friendly and helpful. Laundry detergent pods sold for £1 at the front desk. Bathrooms were relatively clean, but shower curtains felt a bit unhygienic.\n\nOne of my biggest criticisms, however, is the laundry situation which is pretty dire, so I strongly suggest you to do your laundry elsewhere as there are only two washer-dryers and it was almost a competition to try and get your washing load in before someone else did. While not the fault of the hostel, it also didn’t help that some people wouldn’t pick up their laundry up in a timely manner so clothes would be left in the dryer for hours leaving you waiting for longer to use the machines. It’s also behind a door in a hallway that blocks access to people entering or leaving from the kitchen behind it. I’ve included a photo of it for reference as there don’t seem to be any photos on their website.\n\nWifi was pretty patchy too and often forced me to burn up a lot of my mobile data. Power sockets near my bed didn’t work. Also no lift/elevator (like many hostels), so don’t bring any massive bags or suitcases with you unless you’re prepared to drag them up several flights of stairs if you’re assigned a top level room.",

The Russell Square station and other forms of transport were close by, which was great! But for my next trip to London, I would do something closer to the heart of the city.\nService - The people who helped me check in were very lovely. The reception desk is open 24 hours. They do give you flat sheets to make your bed, which didn't mind but I know some will.\nRooms - Very small. I stayed in a 9-bed all-female dorm. The room had 3 sets of 3-decker bunk beds. I had the middle bunk, and the head space you get isn't great. To give you an idea, I'm 5'1 and I bearly could sit up straight when in bed. The bathrooms were soooooo tiny. Again, I'm literally 5'1 and don't weigh more than 130lb and I barely close the door behind myself. There are lockers in the room (bring your own lock)\nOverall - If this is the cheapest option you have available and you just need a place to sleep in an area that feels safe, I'd recommend this place. But if you have a bit more to spend (even just $5 more) I'd say find a place closer to the very center of London (Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Tower of London areas) and it have bigger room.",

I was able to sleep during the hottest heatwave for a few nights. 🌞 I think the information in some booking websites are incorrectly stated that the rooms in Smart Russell Square are air-conditioned (WHICH IS NOT!!!!!!) 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 I survived with my cooling towel and mini USB fan.\n\nTo conclude, the hostel is a very good value hostel with an excellent location in London Central.

Each bed has a reading light and charging point, which makes it easy to use your phone or laptop without disturbing others. Lockable boxes are provided for storing your luggage - about 40x30x20 cm in size, ideal for small bags or backpacks. It's better to carry your own lock and key, but you can also buy one from the reception if needed. There's also a separate baggage storage area available for a small charge, which is handy if you want to explore after checkout.\n\nThe showers and toilets were spotless, with good water pressure. The staff were friendly, polite, and always ready to help. One thing I really liked is the z4-hour bar - a great place to relax or meet other travellers. The location is another big plus: it's within walking distance to the London Eye, so most attractions are easily reachable. The overall vibe was peaceful and safe. For the price and location, this dormitory offers excellent value and comfort. I'd definitely stay here again.",

Nice big TV and easy access to WiFi. The reception staff were exceptional, easy check in and really efficient and friendly. It got better. Breakfast (included) was something else. So much choice, hot and cold. The breakfast staff were also lovely, nothing was too much trouble. Coffee choices were varied and so were the breakfast choices, absolutely delicious. The whole hotel is very tastefully decorated and welcoming. More importantly, we felt safe and well looked after. Parking is easy and very reasonably priced.

You won't be allowed in if you arrive before so if you do arrive early find yourself somewhere to park up and wait.\n\nThe campsite is well laid out, very well maintained, clean and well-kept. It's not uniformly laid out which is great, several grass pitches as well as hardstanding, all clearly marked and signed. The handy plan of the site provided on arrival, as with many sites, is also very handy.\n\nThe shower and toilet block was very clean. It is closed for an hour each day for cleaning. Access is via a key, provided on check-in.\n\nIt took us about ten to fifteen minutes to walk into the town whilst the park is immediately behind the site. There's a nice café there and some good dog walks as well as the park's maze, which surprisingly was food fun.\n\nLevel 9 Google reviewer; 1,000 plus reviews, 1.5 million views and over 12,000 photos with over 50 million views and still going strong 💪.

It will be sad to lose such a lovely site (fabulous mature trees and wildlife) which is well connected to central London. The alternative is very different in its location and vibe. Visit while you still can.\nUpdate: November 2023\nGood location on the northern edge of Crystal Palace Park. Set in amongst lots of mature trees, the pitches are located on several loops off a road. There are two areas near to the office with flat grass pitches for tents.\nThe facilities are not the newest, but everything works well and is very clean (other site users permitting) and the toilet and shower blocks are warm and the water is hot. A pleasure to use. Dishwashing and black water disposal are outside and there is a campervan service area. These are all next to the toilet and shower blocks. There is a dog walking area on site.\nThere is a good selection of wildlife on site with urban foxes scouting for food (don't leave rubbish out or awnings unzipped!), lots of small birds, rooks, squirrels and green parakeets that you can always hear even if you can't see them.\nThe site is close to bus stops with good connections to town. The railway station and 'centre' of Crystal Palace (shops, restaurants, takeaways and bars) is about a fifteen minute walk away. For emergency purchases, there is a petrol station a short way along the road outside the site.\nBeing in town, this isn't the quietest site and concerts and events are held in the park and these can be loud, but they always end at 23.00. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and check what events are taking place nearby. We got to hear some banging sets from acts performing at Wireless last summer, but it won't be to everyone's taste. The bass sounds were loud enough to get our VW resonating and buzzin'\nWe've stayed here lots of times and will continue to come back for as long as the site stays open - hopefully for many years to come.\nExcellent location. Tired but clean facilities. The site is run by nice, friendly people who are very helpful. If you don't fancy the walk into town (walk in and bus back!) check out the number 3 bus route.",

          "reviewText": "We have stayed at the Thistle Hyde Park Kensington Gardens several times over the past years and returned twice in October. For us, the hotel offers the perfect combination of accessibility, relaxation, and comfort.\n\nThe Underground stations Queensway (Central Line), Bayswater (Circle/District Line), and Lancaster Gate (Central Line) are all within a few minutes’ walk, and Paddington Station can be reached with a slightly longer stroll. The hotel is located directly opposite the northern side of Hyde Park, and as the name suggests, Kensington Gardens are just a stone’s throw away. The nearby Queensway provides plenty of restaurants, supermarkets, and shopping opportunities. There used to be a small petrol station with a convenience store right below the hotel, which is currently closed for renovation.\n\nThe rooms are – typically for London – compact but well designed, functional, and comfortable, usually featuring a narrow bathroom with a shower. The Rooms with a View on the upper floors are particularly recommended, as they offer a bit more space and a beautiful view over Hyde Park and the London skyline. We stayed in a family room for four people on the top (9th) floor, consisting of two rooms connected by a small hallway with a bathroom and bathtub. Each room had a double bed and a wall-mounted TV; one also offered additional seating and a small refrigerator. Despite being street-facing, the rooms were pleasantly quiet.\n\nThe hotel staff are consistently friendly, helpful, and attentive in all areas – reception, restaurant, and room service. Early arrivals are well managed: guests can store their luggage safely and start exploring London right away. On previous visits, we were even able to check in early in the morning. On the day of departure, luggage can again be stored at the hotel until the actual time of leaving. The Uber terminal and umbrella station in the lobby are also very convenient – both can be quite handy in London’s unpredictable weather.\n\nIf you have booked breakfast, it’s worth checking the notices in the elevators, especially regarding peak times. On weekends, the buffet area can get busy. The breakfast itself offers a wide selection of hot and cold dishes: various egg options, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, and beans, as well as a good choice of bread, cold cuts, cheese, cereals, and sweet pastries like croissants and cakes. Coffee and tea are available from several machines, alongside a variety of juices. The breakfast area is nicely arranged, comfortable, and spacious enough to ensure a relaxed atmosphere even when full.\n\nFor guests arriving by car, parking spaces are available (for a fee) both in the courtyard and in the underground garage – a convenient option, though we usually travel by train and therefore don’t use this service.\n\nConclusion: A thoroughly recommendable hotel with an excellent location, friendly service, and solid comfort – a reliable place to stay in London that we’ve happily returned to for years.",

I booked a restaurant reservation for 7pm.  Got back to the hotel up 8 flights of stairs to the top room no lift... found the electric fan not working. Phone was not working to ring reception. Went back downstairs to report fan not working was told they would replace it which he did with a,smaller fan. Insisted on showing me how to use said fan..  Then we were going to have a shower before going out went into the bathroom to find they had not  provided any towels. Had to report this to reception and wait a further 10 mins for towels. Sink faulty dripping tap the , shower went from warm to freezing cold. Bedding did not fit bed... not worth the price.\nVery disappointing.",

We very nearly opted not to stay. As mentioned by other reviewers, there was no mattress or pillow protectors. The bedding was too small (the sheet wouldn't tuck in so you'd likely wake up on the mattress itself). The duvet was too small (the exact same size as the mattress) and was damaged so wouldn't do up. The biggest issue was that the bedding was covered in hair and stains. I counted up to 10 hairs before I stopped! We covered the pillows in our own shirts, requested 2 sheets to wrap the mattress in and slept in our clothes. Pretty gross!\n\nThe shower was tiny too. Lucky I'm slim!",

Housekeeping was consistently poor. In one of the rooms, the bathroom floor was dirty upon arrival, and we had to ask for the room to be cleaned again immediately.\n\nBasic amenities were handled terribly. Shampoo and shower gel were not provided unless we asked, and shaving and dental kits were only provided for ONE room — and only on the last day. Completely unacceptable for a hotel of this level.\n\nThe overall experience was horrible. To make things worse, we were charged extra for breakfast, and due to a mistake on their side, we were charged twice.\n\nThe reception and housekeeping staff were rude, dismissive, and unhelpful. Every day we had to complain about cleaning issues. At one point, I escalated the issue to the head of housekeeping, who actually laughed and didn’t even apologize. The level of neglect and lack of professionalism was shocking.\n\nThe only positive point was the restaurant staff, who were polite and genuinely helpful — and the view from the restaurant, which is beautiful. Unfortunately, that is where the positives end.\n\nThe swimming pool and sauna are not freely accessible — you must schedule in advance, which is extremely inconvenient and defeats the purpose of having these facilities.\nThe food is very average, nothing special, and the restaurant only serves Asian food for dinner or room service, which is very limiting.\n\nThe hotel itself feels dark and poorly designed. The lighting is terrible throughout the property. There are not enough power outlets — only one charging spot per room, and the hotel does not provide adapters, which is unacceptable for an international hotel.\n\nMost rooms do not have a view, and overall the hotel is grossly overpriced for the service and experience offered.\n\nI even wrote a formal letter to the manager, and I sincerely hope it is read, because this stay completely ruined my time in London.\nMy first stay here was acceptable — this one was absolutely horrible.\n\nI would never stay here again and do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

Check in was easy and this hotel is very nice inside. They do have room service, they have an amazing pool and steam room and cold shower. There is a Tesco grocery store a two minute walk, the Vauxhall station is a five minute walk and the London Eye is a 20 minute walk. It's in a great location clean, quiet and very safe.\nOne of my favorite things is my new friend that I've made Silfa, she works at the front desk she was extremely accommodating very friendly every day we got home she'd welcomed us and ask us how are day was and what we've done it made the entire stay better.

The breakfast and dinner served in the restaurant were of very good quality, and the concierge team were consistently friendly and helpful.\n\nThere were, however, some service-related issues. We were asked to book a swimming pool time, although no such information was provided during the booking process or at check-in. Additionally, in the restaurant we were asked to wait to be seated, but no staff member was available at the time despite unreserved tables being free.\n\nThe response from staff after we raised our concerns was professional and appreciated. Housekeeping staff were excellent—our room was cleaned daily and maintained to a high standard.\n\nThe hotel facilities were good overall. Although parking is limited (approximately seven spaces), the option to pay separately for on-site parking was convenient for us, particularly when travelling with children. However, the hotel does not offer a dedicated play area for children.\n\nOne drawback was the lack of privacy in our third-floor room, as the nearby building was very close and required us to keep the curtains closed throughout our stay.\n\nOverall, the hotel offers good facilities, quality food, and attentive staff in many areas, with some opportunities for improvement in communication, service consistency, and room privacy.",

There’s no system in place, and people don’t bother to return weights to their designated spots. While the staff makes an effort to tidy up, they simply can’t keep up with the constant mess left behind by members.\n\nThe gym’s layout is another major downside. One section is always overcrowded, while other areas remain practically empty. This poor design isn’t just inconvenient; it’s also unsafe. Equipment is placed too close together, creating a risk of injury. Whoever planned the setup clearly didn’t consider functionality or safety.\n\nOn the positive side, the natural light is fantastic. The large windows fill the space with daylight, creating a more pleasant environment. Additionally, the gym has plenty of new equipment, which is a definite plus. The swimming facilities are also a nice bonus for those who enjoy using them.\n\nHowever, cleanliness is a significant issue, particularly in the men’s toilets. They are consistently dirty, and the smell is unbearable. For a facility charging full price, this level of hygiene is unacceptable.\n\nOverall, this gym might be worth it if you qualify for a discount (e.g., for unemployment or disability). But at full price, there are better and more affordable options nearby.",

One time when I was coming in to do a workout, and I always have problems scanning myself through the gates, because it's so complicated, she said 'this happens every time you come here then once when I tried to scan it through it still wasn't working so as a gate opened I just walked through it because honestly I'm not going to spend hours trying to just get into the gym, as I walked through, I had my headphones on so I couldn't hear her so she walked up to me and yanked me back by my backpack handle, she wasn't being rough but did it with enough force, who does she think she is doing that honestly, and it's not just me, I've seen her be rude with others. Absolutely disgusting behaviour!!!\n\nFirstly the gym floor is always a little bit dirty, as well as the machines, and dumbbells all in the wrong places on the wrack, and sometimes some of them are missing.\nThe upstairs changing room floor is always soaking wet and water everywhere, I understand that it's because of the leaks but just fix them tbh.\n\nThis gym also needs more cleaners to come into the changing rooms to help flush toilets cause clearly some grown women can't and I'm sorry but its disgusting, not really what you want to see when you walk into a changing room. Also would be nice that people get rid of the pieces of hair they leave by the hairdryer area on the 1st women's changing room. Also you have to pay for the sauna and steam room, £13 per hour, for something you're only going to use for about 10 mins LOL\n\nOverall the gym is ok, but trust me, there's much better places, and that's where I'll be going!!!",

The changing rooms, toilets and shower area seem to be always dirty and the place does smell rather badly. I would never dare to use the toilets due to the foul smell emanating from them and they look filthy. Also there are lots of cubicles with locks not working.            I understand that there is an extra volume of people due to Highbury Pool's temporary closure but then more staff  should be in place to keep the place pleasant. Sometimes I feel that I should be wiping my shoes off as I leave the Centre.              I have gotten used to the shared mixed changing areas and I understand that this helps with parents who may have a child of the opposite sex.

It definitely could use better airflow or air conditioning.\n\nOn a more positive note, the swimming facilities are excellent. The pools are well-maintained and the swimming classes are top-notch.

They offer a solid selection of protein shakes, which is great post-workout, though the rest of the menu could be a bit more exciting.\n\nOverall, Copthall Leisure Centre has potential.

Brand-new machines (no waiting around), spotless space, and even a sauna that feels like a reward after training. Personal highlights: Pilates classes and a café inside for a post-workout coffee — super convenient.\n\nA special shout-out to Samir for making the onboarding process smooth and welcoming. He explained everything clearly, answered all our questions with patience, and set a really positive tone for getting started. This kind of thoughtful introduction makes a huge difference when you’re joining somewhere new.\n\nThe whole place has great energy — modern, spacious, and motivating. Can’t wait to settle into a routine here and make the most of everything on offer.",

This isn’t a one-off issue – it’s been there every time I’ve visited. The gym feels damp, poorly ventilated and unhygienic, and the showers feel grimy and unpleasant, not like somewhere you actually want to use after training.\n\nThere is no proper air conditioning, the gym is small and cramped, and there is limited equipment compared with other Anytime Fitness branches. Several key pieces of kit you’d reasonably expect at this price point are missing, and overall it does not justify the membership cost if this is your main club. By contrast, Anytime Fitness Swiss Cottage and Ladbroke Grove are clean, well-maintained and properly equipped, so the gap in standards is very obvious.\n\nI’ve also felt uncomfortable with the behaviour of the manager. On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed him staring at female members while they work out, which creates an uneasy and unprofessional atmosphere. For a gym that should feel safe and welcoming to everyone, this is not acceptable.\n\nAnytime Fitness has clearly moved towards a franchise model, but whoever is running the Chalk Farm franchise is dragging the brand down. The owner and manager of this gym are putting the reputation of Anytime Fitness into question.\n\nI will be escalating this to Anytime Fitness management and headquarters, because this site is a serious let-down compared with other branches and needs urgent attention. Until there is a clear improvement in cleanliness, maintenance, equipment and professionalism from management, I would strongly recommend choosing a different Anytime Fitness branch – or a different gym altogether.",

It also has private, luxurious showers and changing rooms, which really add to the overall experience. You can check the app to see how busy it is, but in my experience, I've never been there with more than 7/8 people.

The cost is exorbitant for a public toilet - especially with all the food services on this floor. Also, the toilets are incredibly badly designed. The sink basin is too small so when you open the tap to wash your hands it splashed all over the floor. This makes the toilets always wet and super dirty. There are also no hooks to safeguard your bag or jacket. I was desperate so I paid this. But I am so disappointed. Obviously will not be able to rely on this toilet anymore. And so will be going to the area less and less. Until something changes.",

The plunge pools that you climb down the ladder into were soooo cold I could only stay in for about 5 seconds. A lady spent too long in there and fainted when she got out so do be careful, especially if you’re a newbie to saunas/ice baths. Could be improved by having hot showers and having a clock! We had no idea what time it was and how long we had left. Overall, great experience and would come back!",

They decided to remove the disinfectant wipes and most machines are soo dirty. Showers and dressing rooms are not nice either. I get it’s a cheap gym but still, they should at least maintain an average level of sanitation. Atmosphere is okay just won’t be returning because of how filthy it is.  The cardio machines are covered in grime…",

They took the time to search everywhere and managed to find it for me, which I really appreciated. It reminded me how great this gym is, not just for the facilities, but also for the genuinely friendly and supportive team that run it.\n\nThe facilities are excellent – clean showers, WCs, and locker areas. There’s plenty of equipment to get a solid workout in, and they’ve clearly thought about what members need. For example, there are extra squat racks upstairs (4 squat racks plus 1 Smith machine), which makes a big difference on busy days. They also have more benches (5) than most other gyms in the Tooting area – something worth mentioning because free weights and benches are always too scarce in commercial gyms, but not here. On top of that, there are loads of machines and cable options so you’re never short of variety.\n\nOverall, a fantastic gym with great staff, clean facilities, and more than enough equipment. Highly recommended.",

I would still stay here again.",

The room was carpeted which really helped make it quieter as well, I didn’t even bring earplugs and was just fine. Also no issues with lights at all. The toilets are clearly regularly cleaned and the showers were spacious and private as well. There was no queue either, even the day I showered right before checkout time. There is also a nice vanity area in the corridor so you can do skincare or whatever in a dry area without waking people up. Staff were friendly and helpful as well. This was honestly very peaceful. I am very reserved so I didn’t go to these but there were some fun looking social events as well if you want to make friends.\n\nThe location is very good, felt safe in a posh area right near a bus stop and the Swiss Cottage tube station. Tesco express nearby with a coffee shop and a laundromat as well.\n\nOverall I thought this was nice, especially for the price, and would absolutely stay again next time I have a short stay in London.",

The Brazilian guy in charge of breakfast is super kind and attentive. I would also like to highlight Adam, the blond guy with curly hair, who tried to help me when the washing machine was not working. I was told that there is a special key used for these situations, but unfortunately it was lost. Still, his attitude was very helpful and professional. The guy who did my check-in, Lachlan, was also very kind.\n\nThe common areas are nice and pleasant to spend time in, and the breakfast is good for the price.\n\nHowever, there are some negative points: the beds are extremely uncomfortable, and the bed sheets were dirty and yellowish, which should be improved urgently.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the rooms, in particular, did not feel like that of a typical youth or traveler hostel. At times, it felt more like a shelter for homeless people, which is not a pleasant environment if you are looking for a traveler or social hostel experience.\n\nAfter mentioning this to one of the reception girls (I don’t remember her name, but she told me she is from Lithuania), she explained that because London is such an expensive city, many people with family or work-related problems end up staying in places like this. I understand and empathize with this situation, but hostels and hotels are usually meant for travelers, and when the room atmosphere is not traveler-oriented, it is not a pleasant environment for guests looking for that experience.\n\nIn summary, great location and very friendly staff, but issues with comfort and the atmosphere inside the rooms.",

Easy to go to the British Museum and the Big Ben. Just feel stops away from the major theaters and the Regent street. Perfect if you want to see the famous tourist attractions in London.\nFacility is adequate, if you are looking for toilets made with gold choose somewhere else, otherwise it has all the facilities you will need. You can freely use the kitchen in the basement floor from 12:00pm. Breakfast is provided at 5.5 pounds. Laundry is 5pounds for the wash and 2 pounds for the dry, very fair price cuz I can chuck all my winter clothes in at once.\nThe room is pretty decent with individual lockers and charging stations for each bed. But be aware that the locker is not big enough to put suitcases bigger than 24 inches. But you can just put your larger suitcases in the open area in the room with your own lock on and it’s safe. Remember to bring a lock for the locker.",

At first, I saw many mixed reviews, but after staying here, I truly felt the staff were very friendly. The room was clean and tidy, and I had no bad experiences. There was no curtain beside the bed, but there were four outlets in the room, which was more than enough. The food sold on the first floor was affordable and tasty, and it’s also a good choice if you want to have a drink. If you need hot water, you can ask for it at the bar. The self-service breakfast costs £9.5 and is enough to make you full. The bathrooms and toilets were clean too, although some locks were broken, but it didn’t affect usage. The heating starts at 8 p.m. and lasts until the morning; sometimes it starts earlier or ends earlier. I am still staying here now, and I highly recommend this place to travelers who come to London and don’t have very high requirements for accommodation.",

The basement washroom/shower is definitely a gay cruising spot, and there's nothing stopping any old Joe off the street going in for a shower honestly. The dryers.... They're in dire need of a deep clean. I went to tell reception that maintenance should look at them and he snickered \"it's not a maintenance issue\"... There's a buildup of debris and lint under the lint tray that gets sucked up onto the silver extractor pipe. This prevents hot air from escaping so you could dry it 6-7 times and still have wet clothes. I did what I could to fix them, and offered to do the job to completion but was never called back about this: this leads me to believe they leave them in disrepair so they make more money out of you. My advice; take your laundry out the hostel and turn right, then right again and there's a laundromat there.\nCellphone service is near non existent, as is usual in old police buildings.",

The marina itself is beautifully maintained, with tranquil surroundings and stunning views that create a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere. Whether you're visiting by boat or just looking for a lovely spot to stay, it’s the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle.\n\nThe facilities are excellent: clean, modern showers and washrooms, well-kept pontoons, ample parking, and a fantastic café serving great coffee and homemade cakes — ideal for a leisurely afternoon. The entire site is immaculately presented and clearly cared for with pride.\n\nThe staff deserve a special mention: professional, helpful, and always ready with a smile. Nothing was too much trouble, and their attention to detail really made the whole experience stand out.\n\nThe village itself has a lovely, friendly feel with plenty of walks nearby for anyone who enjoys nature and the outdoors. It’s also a great spot to moor up and explore the surrounding area.\n\nIn short, Royden Marina Village is a perfect place for boaters, holidaymakers, and anyone looking for a peaceful getaway with top-class facilities and service. I’ll definitely be back — it’s a place you won’t want to leave!\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

Nice towels, toiletries and hair dryer provided. Small refrigerator in room as well as electric kettle to make our own tea or Nescafé. AC worked great and it was around 100F when we were there. They offered to make us breakfast but we declined and they gave us some fruit. Young man that runs it very friendly. Picked us up and dropped us off at the airport. Arranged for a boat ride on Lake Nasser for sunrise at an extremely reasonable price.",

As an IHG member we could of got a late check out but unfortunately we had to be home early.\nThe floor we were on, was very nice and you could tell it had been renovated, it was very appealing. The room itself was very spacious, clean and trendy. The window was like a door and opened wide overlooking the docks, it was really pleasant. Bed was super comfy as were the pillows, the bathroom had an amazing shower and a big mirror.\nWe didn't have an evening meal there but there menu was good and you had the option of room service too.\nAlthough close to the nightlife of Camden, the windows were soundproofed from the main hustle and bustle although a bit of noise seeped though... we were provided with ear plugs which was a nice touch (we didn't use them, but I definitely took them home with me!). Slept really well.\nHad breakfast in the morning which was well attended by staff, they were very helpful. Breakfast was good, there was a good selection of foods and drinks to choose from.

The lighting in the changing rooms near the mirrors needs to be brighter as it is too dark to see one’s face properly.  There is wasted space at the entrance.  This could be a coffee shop where people can socialise.  The gym just needs a general clean up, redesign and brand new equipment.   It needs to be a vibrant and happy place.",

The gym was designed by someone who doesn’t go to the gym.  I hope this helps to improve the gym as £60 per month is a bit too steep for such low standards.  The gym is also too small.  The lighting in the changing rooms near the mirrors needs to be brighter as it is too dark to see one’s face properly.  There is wasted space at the entrance.  This could be a coffee shop where people can socialise.  The gym just needs a general clean up, redesign and brand new equipment.   It needs to be a vibrant and happy place.",

Friendly staff (now really hot and miss), friendly punters, friendly cleaners, wonderful tummy sessions and clean gym equipment. It's so sad to see what used to be a community facility in such a grubby and run-down state. As many have said the gym equipment is filthy, changing rooms would also benefit from a deep clean and a bit more care.  Please take some action as loads of peeps are saying the same things! Love x",

In short, there are obviously much better gyms in the area in terms of workout equipment, which is very old and impossible to get to in peak times here, but I joined solely for the jacuzzi and pool. Unfortunately the pool is always full of screaming kids on the weekend and evenings, because apparently the extortionate membership fees aren't enough to keep them solvent, they have to turn to swimming lessons as a financial lifeline. Locker rooms even worse, uncontrolled screaming kids running around with their parents incapable of keeping them in check. So the idea of relaxing in the pool or the jacuzzi go out the window because there's no peace whatsoever - it's either the screaming kids or the songs that the swimming lesson instructors lead them in that are apparently an essential part of their swimming learning, or bunches of guys talking at the top of their voices in the jacuzzi, or shouting to each other from across the wet area like they're at home. Something in the spa area is always broken and I mean literally always. For the last few months it's been the jets in the circular spa bath area of the jacuzzi, prior to that it was various other elements of the jacuzzi, or the steam room, or the sauna, etc. Temperature of the jacuzzi also used to be nice and warm, is now just tepid. But again, no point mentioning it, because the management cares only about the next monthly price increase. The only time I saw the them move to do anything was when I told them there was a homeless guy in the change rooms - in the family area too, which is the only place you can get a locker because they let people leave their padlocks on their lockers for days and probably months on end, so at the start of every day if you're the first person in the door there are maybe only ten lockers free. Homeless guy was standing in the middle of the family area shouting to himself, just about to do god knows what. Not sure how this can happen but nothing surprises me about this place",

The built-in hairdryers are Dyson, which is a nice touch. Plus, there are amenities provided, which is delightful. Amazingly, you can get coffee from the coffee machine for just one pound.\nThe lower floor is the gym area, fully equipped with everything from treadmills to free-weight spaces. The machines are well-spaced, making it easy to move around. It’s relatively empty on weekday mornings, but Saturday mornings can get crowded. The staff occasionally do checks, and the atmosphere is really great.\nSo far, I haven’t found anything that needs improvement. As I keep saying, the cleanliness and the stylish lighting in the gym area really boost my motivation to work out. I absolutely love this Anytime Fitness!",

Coffee machine with heavily discounted prices is a nice tough. They have GHD hair straighteners and hair dryers, hair ties + deodorant on hand.\n\nGym equipment wise I can’t fault, there are 4-5 stair masters and an abundance of treadmills. Not the mention the professional grade squat and bench racks. Heavy and steady benches for free dumbbells weights and benching. I think there’s about 6+ squat/bench racks. A bucket full of clips and some more, an abundance of plates to use.  2 smith machines, so there is never too much overcrowding and forced turn taking between sets. There is a CrossFit section, Olympic ropes, RDX cables, 2-3 double cable machines for a good chest and shoulder day.\n\nI would say my only small gripe is scrambling to find the foam roller, I have sciatic pain from time to time so I do need the foam roller to stretch out my muscles.  There’s only about 2-3, maybe add another 2?",

I’ve been going to one of the other local Anytime Fitness’s but decided to walk the extra 10 minutes from Kings Cross Station yesterday to try out the Angel - gosh I can see this becoming my regular Anytime Fitness.\n\nThey have 7 racks, which is so dreamy. There are 3 functional trainer cable machines also meaning there's always one available when you need it. Plus you’ve got cable pull downs and seat cable pull equipment - something the ones nearby do not have. You’ve got all your plate machines all in one zone then you pin machines in one zone also - very well laid out if you ask me.\n\n… oh and two of each of the sets of free weights for the most popular weights meaning you can pretty much always life your target weight.\n\nThe facilities are top-notch—plenty of showers (I have to queue at the ones nearby), Dyson hair dryers in the vanity section, plenty of toilets also. It’s clear the staff take pride in maintaining a clean and welcoming environment. There’s also plenty of space to move around, even during peak hours, which makes every workout stress-free and enjoyable.\n\nThen you stumble into the spin studio or the dance/multi purpose studio which are both LOVELY!\n\nIf you're looking for a gym that has everything you need and more, look no further than Anytime Fitness Angel. Highly recommend it to anyone, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym-goer. 💪👏",

Firstly you can bring your buggy/prams as they have a place for you to park it, secondly you should buy your tickets online to save time and thirdly bring plenty of water as you will need it. I went here with my toddler and she loves it. They have a huge space dedicated to the giant jungle gym where you can either play in the under 2’s area or where all the other older kids go. This is adult friendly and strong enough for you to also enjoy and bring out your inner kid. After 10 minutes I was already sweating and felt like this was PE all over again. If can get very busy as we saw multiple birthdays parties here booked into different time slots. Depending on when you book you will be given a coloured paper wrist band on your child’s wrist that determines the time for you leave. The allocated time slot is definitely enough time for your little ones to work up a sweat and for you to leave with them ready for nap time. Highly recommend this place to all parents who want a nice day out that won’t break the bank and has clean changing facilities in multiple toilets so even if you have to wait it won’t be for too long. They also have a cafe on site so you can refresh with sweet treats and even a refreshing slushy. We came here by guys and it was easily accessible with the buggy and easy to find.\nHeads up parents you should be dressed comfortably as you too will be moving around and  climbing, jumping and rolling around.",

Maybe let’s fix them?\n4) mothers going to the female changing room with boys and leaving them roaming around. One of them today opened the door of my shower multiple times because he was left alone in there by his mother (again, let’s fix the door lock).\n5) even though the price is not low (see above) there will be a guy that kicks you out after your 1hr slot is over. And, considering the issues with all the people not swimming in the medium and fast lane, it’s really hard if you have a training programme to follow and a target distance.\nThe only positive thing I can say is that the swim doctor classes for adults are good, hence I’m giving 2 stars and not just one.",

The sandy beach is a huge hit with kids, and the pirate ship playground is genuinely brilliant—it kept my little ones entertained for ages. The miniature railway is a lovely touch and a fun way to see the whole area. There's a real sense of community here, and it’s great that entry is free.\nMy main reason for the 3.5 stars is to manage expectations for anyone new. First and foremost, you can't swim in the lake, which is a bit disappointing for a \"lido.\" The water is beautiful to look at, but if you or the kids are hoping to jump in, you'll be out of luck. Secondly, on a sunny day, it gets incredibly crowded. Be prepared to hunt for a parking spot and find your patch of sand in a sea of people. The facilities are basic, and the queues for food and toilets can be quite long.\nOverall, it's a brilliant place for what it is—a free, family-friendly beach experience in a beautiful woodland setting. Just go in knowing it's more about the sand and the playground than the swimming, and you'll have a great time!",

After 1.5 years of sciatica pain and 6 months away from the gym, even basic daily movements left me in pain. I tried swimming just to stay active, but I didn’t enjoy it.\n\nThen one day, the pool was closed, and I happened to speak to Bernard. He asked why I wasn’t lifting weights, so I explained my situation. He offered me a session to assess, and I gave it a try.\n\nI thought whatever. I have tried all the possible treatment and spent so much money on it!\n\nAfter just two sessions, all my pain was gone. Within a week, he had me lifting my previous personal best – something I never thought possible again.\n\nNow I’m lifting weights I couldn’t even dream about before.

After 1.5 years of sciatica pain and 6 months away from the gym, even basic daily movements left me in pain. I tried swimming just to stay active, but I didn’t enjoy it.\n\nThen one day, the pool was closed, and I happened to speak to Bernard. He asked why I wasn’t lifting weights, so I explained my situation. He offered me a session to assess, and I gave it a try.\n\nI thought whatever. I have tried all the possible treatment and spent so much money on it!\n\nAfter just two sessions, all my pain was gone. Within a week, he had me lifting my previous personal best – something I never thought possible again.\n\nNow I’m lifting weights I couldn’t even dream about before. I’m pain-free, stronger, more confident, and finally enjoying working out again.\n\nThank you, Bernard – you’ve truly given me my training (and life!) back. 💪",

The showers are often dirty, with an unpleasant drain smell, and the sauna, steam room, and spa areas feel unclean, with walls, tiles, floors, and mirrors in the changing rooms clearly in need of thorough cleaning. There also appears to be a damp issue behind the water fountain near the steam room, which feels unhygienic and shouldn’t be present in that area, especially as it attracts bugs and bacteria. While the gym itself is excellent, the changing rooms and spa facilities would really benefit from a deep clean followed by consistent, regular maintenance to ensure the environment remains clean, safe, and hygienic for members.",

It’s about how a business responds when a female member is made to feel unsafe, ignored, and passed around between managers who want to wash their hands of the issue.

There is a shelf, a light and charging stations above every bed which was great because that way I can sleep knowing that my valuables are next to me and I will also hear my alarm clock in the morning. Very good locker space. The showers are clean and spacious. Also there is a very nice bar and a lounge. 10/10 would recommend.",

There were a few people who came and went, but for the most part I was familiar with most of the people during my stay.\n\nThe toilets and showers were what I would expect at a hostel. Very simple and acceptable.\n\nThe Community areas were great. The TV and Computer rooms were unique and kind of fun to spend some time in. The bar area was fun. A lot of room to find a place to sit. I met great people there that made my trip even better.\n\nI loved the location of the building. A bus from the Kings cross station dropped me off right in front of the building. The bus wasn't really necessary either. It was only a short walk to the station. There are plenty of restaurants along the way too.\n\nOverall, great experience.",

Each bed has a light, an outlet, and a USB port. Lockers were big enough for my hand luggage. You can have quiet in your room, or if you're looking to stay up, enjoy the bar in the basement, which also serves food. Staff are friendly and do a wonderful job keeping the place very clean. This would have been a five star but I just couldn't stand how jam packed and crowded the kitchen/dining area always was. The tables, vending machines, benches and counters are just not spaced appropriately for many people are always in there, and you really can't even move at breakfast. The hallways are also very narrow, but I understand that it's an old building. I would absolutely recommend this place, and will likely be back!!",

Free breakfast, not great but much much better than nothing (I had tea, juice and toast with jam, worked fine). Wifi everywhere. The showers are much better than hostel standard, and I never found them to be too cold as some others have posted, they were just perfect.\n\nThe fuse by my bed broke when I was here, and the staff was fantastic at fixing it right away. They have strict rules for orderly conduct at the hostel, and they seem to follow up on it since everyone was extremely well behaved.\n\nI have absolutely no negative comments.

When we reported this to the night receptionist, we were provided with towels , but there were no extra pillows available, and nothing could be done about the sink at that time. So we used the towels as pillows and had no blankets for the night.\n\nHowever, I would like to highlight the exceptional service provided by Carolina at check-out. She was very friendly, empathetic, and solution-oriented. After we shared our experience with her, she sincerely apologized for the inconvenience and even offered us complimentary breakfast as a gesture of goodwill. Thanks to her, we left the hotel with a positive feeling after this.\n\nCarolina is truly a role model for customer service — thank you again!",

It gets pretty busy and booked out really quickly.\n\nThe last slot is from 9.20pm to 10pm but the centre closes bang on 10pm so no option to use changing rooms to shower.\n\nVery reasonable prices and cheaper if you do pay as you go annual membership.",

The pools were all well managed by the lifeguards, they were actively checking how busy the pools were, closing them at capacity, making sure children were using the slides correctly etc which was nice to see. The two smaller pools were great for my toddlers and they really enjoyed the slides. We travelled half an hour to get here as we don’t have anything like this near us so it was a nice change. The only improvement for us would be more family changing rooms as they were full when we got there and the small changing rooms were very tricky to change twin toddlers in. They can’t help the size of the building though! We’d visit again",

All the normal open water swimming rules apply: ie cap must be worn, no swimming on your back or they'll assume you need assistance and kayak over to check on you.\n\nOnly downside: It's a bit expensive for non-members. The facilities will be nicer once the big upgrade has happened (due to start summer 2025).",

You cannot go to water for the second time (because they took your rubber bracelet)!!! There is barely any seating. So be a good stoic, go in, go out, change with all people watching and be on your way.\n\nYou HAVE to book in advance through terrible better app (the name of the app is a comic misnomer) and one off swim costs £13.15 in July 20025.",

I ended up swimming in a pink woolly hat which actually soaked up water and weighed me down but I was not allowed to remove it. There is only a small concreted area to rest, all the surrounding areas had been closed but entry price remained the same. Honestly not worth the cost and sucked the joy out of open water swimming.",

Instead of receiving support, I was spoken to harshly by management and banned from the gym, while the woman who assaulted me faced no consequence.\n\nDuring that conversation, remarks were made about my personality and the way I carry myself — including comments about how I “walk” and how I’m “popular” with staff and members. These comments were completely inappropriate, unprofessional, and felt personal and discriminatory. I was even described as “wild” and told I didn’t know how to behave, which was deeply insulting and unfair, especially as I was the one who had just been assaulted.\n\nAs a woman of colour, I can’t ignore the racial bias and stereotyping that seemed to shape how I was treated. Many members who have known me for years reached out afterwards, expressing shock and sadness over how this situation was handled, and some said they no longer feel comfortable attending the gym.\n\nI do want to make it clear that the staff and members at Fit This are phenomenal — warm, supportive, and professional. My issue lies entirely with the management, whose handling of this situation was unacceptable and unprofessional.\n\nI hope they take this as a moment to reflect seriously on accountability, respect, and the importance of addressing racial bias. No member should ever feel unsafe, dismissed, or humiliated in a place meant for wellbeing and community.\n\nFollowing the manager’s public reply to my review, I felt it was important to respond with clarity and honesty so that my experience is fully understood.\n\nThank you for your response. I appreciate that the gym takes incidents seriously, but I want to clarify that my account is truthful and comes from a place of genuine hurt. I was physically assaulted and then spoken to in a demeaning way, being called “wild” and told I “don’t  know how to behave.”\n\nDespite being the one who was assaulted, I was banned indefinitely, while the other party was allowed to remain. Fairness would have meant both individuals being asked to leave pending investigation — instead, only I was penalised.\n\nIt is well known among staff, members, and even the manager that I did not lay a finger on the person who assaulted me, yet he continues to describe me as “the aggressor” and my behaviour as “threatening.” I genuinely do not understand what he is referring to, as I did not behave violently in any way.\n\nHis comments about CCTV also gave me pause for thought — particularly as there is no CCTV in the ladies’ locker room, making it impossible for him to have reviewed the most crucial part of the incident. Any conclusions drawn from footage could only reflect what occurred at the main desk, where my attacker continued to goad me while I reported the incident to staff. Even then, I did not act violently or in a threatening manner; I simply raised my voice in distress after being harmed.\n\nThe manager stated that he acted fairly, yet his decision to immediately ban me indefinitely — while reassuring the individual who assaulted me — demonstrates the opposite. His actions and language throughout this incident reflect a very clear racial bias, and the events that took place only reinforce that. Describing me as “aggressive” and “threatening” for expressing justified emotion after being assaulted is a damaging and racially loaded stereotype that should never have been used.\n\nSeveral members who witnessed what happened have since reached out, expressing shock and disappointment. My concerns about bias and how the situation was handled remain sincere. Unfortunately, the manager’s response failed to address my concerns directly and instead relied on widely used rhetoric that doesn’t reflect the reality of what took place.\n\nI continue to wish the wonderful staff and members — who have always been warm and respectful — all the very best.",

If you prefer to drive then there’s free parking after 5:30pm and all day Sunday’s.\n\nIt looks very small from the outside, as you can’t see how many arches they’ve taken. But it’s actually quite long and also us a women’s only workout area if the ladies prefer segregation. They have great equipment, enough space and also a spacious changing room with a sauna inside it. The shower cubicles are the biggest non-family cubicles I’ve seen! The neon lights everywhere makes the place feel alive, even when there’s not many people in the gym (gives you good energy for a good workout). The staff there are really friendly too!",

The gym was a little small for my liking. Im a free weights person, and having only three benches in the dumbbell area just wasn’t for me. I went to check the place out on a day pass and luckily found one spare when I went on peak times… but I know this wouldn’t be a regular thing if I joined. Upstairs was boiling hot (don’t know if they have AC or if it wasn’t working). Downstairs was very cool and fresh feeling as the AC was on. The entire gym was a bit too small for my liking as I had to walk in zig zags to not interrupt the members workouts. What I did love about the place was that they had individual shower area with connected changing area. It’s like having your own changing room! They also had a separate changing room cubicles. Again that was your own cubicle so you get maximum privacy when you get changed or you’re showering. Overall it’s a nice gym, but it was too small and busy for the times I go to the gym.",

I saw the rest of the pods and everything looked beautiful.\n\nI’d recommend this for all sorts of users - new to fitness, recovering from an injury or pregnancy, not wanting to deal with a crowded gym or those just wanting some private time.

We even arrived earlier than the booking time and were able to move our booked time to an earlier one which was really useful.\n\nWe booked a Strength pod and were really impressed with the space itself and equipment. Really clean, private space with everything you could need for a workout.\n\nThe individual shower/changing rooms were also great and really handy, plus really well maintained. Being able to hire a towel for only £1.50 each was also really convenient as it saved us needing to bring our own.\n\nThe woman working on reception and the co-founder who was in reception were both really friendly and helpful while greeting us and showing us round.\n\nFor what you get and the quality of the equipment, it's really well priced. Would definitely come back here to train in future!",

We even arrived earlier than the booking time and were able to move our booked time to an earlier one which was really useful.\n\nWe booked a Strength pod and were really impressed with the space itself and equipment. Really clean, private space with everything you could need for a workout.\n\nThe individual shower/changing rooms were also great and really handy, plus really well maintained.

          "reviewText": "​🚨 Formal Complaint: Urgent Improvements Required at Everyone Active Stratford\n​To the Management Team,\n​I am writing to express my significant dissatisfaction with several persistent issues at the Everyone Active Stratford leisure center, where my family has been a member for approximately 18 months. The following areas require immediate management attention and permanent resolution, as they are severely impacting the member experience:\n\n​1. Persistent E-Gate Malfunction (Facility Integrity)\n​The electronic entry gate has been consistently unreliable for the entire duration of our membership (1.5 years). Today, the ongoing fault reached a critical point, signifying a complete failure of the system.\n​Issue: The e-gate is perpetually broken or malfunctioning.\n​Impact: This creates unnecessary friction at entry and defeats the purpose of an automated access system.\n​Action Required: I request that this system is fixed permanently and thoroughly, not just temporarily reset. This has become a chronic and highly annoying operational failure.\n\n​2. Poor Customer Service and Reception Staff Demeanor (Staff Conduct)\n​The general demeanor and attitude of the reception staff are consistently unprofessional and unwelcoming.\n​Observation: Staff members frequently appear moody, do not smile, and project an air of annoyance towards members.\n​Impact: This creates an unwelcoming atmosphere and makes members hesitant to approach the desk.\n​Specific Incident: When attempting to raise a complaint about the changing rooms (see point 3), the staff member offered an unhelpful response, stating, \"unfortunately, I can't help you with this,\" rather than escalating the feedback or logging a maintenance request.\n​Action Required: Management must address the customer service standards and provide necessary training to ensure staff adopt a professional, helpful, and welcoming disposition.\n\n​3. Unsanitary Changing Room Conditions (Hygiene and Maintenance)\n​The cleanliness of the changing rooms, particularly on the floor, is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the facility's hygiene standards.\n​Observation: The changing room floors are often visibly dirty, especially around 11:00 AM, with excessive amounts of hair left after members use the drying facilities.\n​Impact: This creates an unpleasant and unsanitary environment for all members.\n​Action Required: Cleaners are employed to maintain hygiene. Management must ensure that the cleaning schedule and standards are strictly enforced, with frequent checks during peak usage times, and that staff are held accountable for their duties.\n\n​4. Lack of Communication in Swim Stage Progression (Children's Programs)\n​There is a significant failure in communicating the progression path for children enrolled in swimming lessons.\n​Issue: Instructors do not adequately explain the criteria for moving from one stage to the next, nor do they clearly communicate the child's individual growth and necessary next steps.\n​Impact: Parents lack transparency regarding their child's development and the value of the lessons.\n​Action Required: All swim teachers must be instructed to provide regular, clear, and actionable feedback to parents on how their child is progressing and the specific skills required to advance to the next stage.\n\n​I expect a formal acknowledgment of this detailed complaint and a clear plan of action regarding these four fundamental areas of service and operational failure.",

          "reviewText": "​🚨 Formal Complaint: Urgent Improvements Required at Everyone Active Stratford\n​To the Management Team,\n​I am writing to express my significant dissatisfaction with several persistent issues at the Everyone Active Stratford leisure center, where my family has been a member for approximately 18 months. The following areas require immediate management attention and permanent resolution, as they are severely impacting the member experience:\n\n​1. Persistent E-Gate Malfunction (Facility Integrity)\n​The electronic entry gate has been consistently unreliable for the entire duration of our membership (1.5 years). Today, the ongoing fault reached a critical point, signifying a complete failure of the system.\n​Issue: The e-gate is perpetually broken or malfunctioning.\n​Impact: This creates unnecessary friction at entry and defeats the purpose of an automated access system.\n​Action Required: I request that this system is fixed permanently and thoroughly, not just temporarily reset. This has become a chronic and highly annoying operational failure.\n\n​2. Poor Customer Service and Reception Staff Demeanor (Staff Conduct)\n​The general demeanor and attitude of the reception staff are consistently unprofessional and unwelcoming.\n​Observation: Staff members frequently appear moody, do not smile, and project an air of annoyance towards members.\n​Impact: This creates an unwelcoming atmosphere and makes members hesitant to approach the desk.\n​Specific Incident: When attempting to raise a complaint about the changing rooms (see point 3), the staff member offered an unhelpful response, stating, \"unfortunately, I can't help you with this,\" rather than escalating the feedback or logging a maintenance request.\n​Action Required: Management must address the customer service standards and provide necessary training to ensure staff adopt a professional, helpful, and welcoming disposition.\n\n​3. Unsanitary Changing Room Conditions (Hygiene and Maintenance)\n​The cleanliness of the changing rooms, particularly on the floor, is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the facility's hygiene standards.\n​Observation: The changing room floors are often visibly dirty, especially around 11:00 AM, with excessive amounts of hair left after members use the drying facilities.\n​Impact: This creates an unpleasant and unsanitary environment for all members.\n​Action Required: Cleaners are employed to maintain hygiene. Management must ensure that the cleaning schedule and standards are strictly enforced, with frequent checks during peak usage times, and that staff are held accountable for their duties.\n\n​4. Lack of Communication in Swim Stage Progression (Children's Programs)\n​There is a significant failure in communicating the progression path for children enrolled in swimming lessons.\n​Issue: Instructors do not adequately explain the criteria for moving from one stage to the next, nor do they clearly communicate the child's individual growth and necessary next steps.\n​Impact: Parents lack transparency regarding their child's development and the value of the lessons.\n​Action Required: All swim teachers must be instructed to provide regular, clear, and actionable feedback to parents on how their child is progressing and the specific skills required to advance to the next stage.\n\n​I expect a formal acknowledgment of this detailed complaint and a clear plan of action regarding these four fundamental areas of service and operational failure.",

The view from the sauna is great, and the heat of the sauna itself is top notch.  The showering facilities are nice, and it's a relaxing atmosphere.  The front desk staff are helpful and personable.  The time slots are quite strict, so make sure you take them seriously - but it does give confidence in knowing that they ensure cleanliness between patrons.  It's too bad that it's booked up so far in advance!  I would love for them to expand their offering, and hopefully build more facilities!",

Firstly, it's very hard to find this place as there's no noticeable sign labels of it.  Especially in the evening, it becomes very hard to locate it. I think it would be better if you can put up some led displays. Also, I think hot water is essential especially for an outdoor sauna and hope you will provide it in the future. One more thing, having steel padlocks for the lockers would be great. Thank you!!",

I wasn’t sure what to expect, so my expectations were low—but I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nAt this location, there are three saunas: a medium-heat larger one, a very hot slightly smaller one, and a silent one. There are also three cold plunge baths (8°C, 3°C, and 2°C) and free filtered water and tea.\n\nAll the saunas were great. My favorite was the silent one, as some groups in the other saunas were quite loud, talking as if they were in a bar. The silent sauna was just perfect. They even bring in crushed ice with essential oils—it smells amazing! The downside is that it’s small and can get packed.\n\nThe cold plunges are big and very cold. On a chilly day, it’s easy to just step out and cool down naturally, or use the cold shower, which is just as cold.\n\nOne thing to note: there’s no hot shower, so no way to wash or dry your hair. I did my research and was prepared for that.\n\nBesides that, the team is friendly, the saunas are perfect, and the prices are amazing. Will definitely be back!",

          "reviewText": "I have been here a few times now.  My most recent visit was a bit shocking.  There is little to no sauna etiquette from other patrons.  The single sauna was over crowded, and people were leaving their towels in the sauna to claim seats.  It was deeply uncomfortable and not very considerate.  The staff seem like genuine friendly people but they don't really say much upon arrival as most of the staff I've met have either been on the phone to a friend wearing headphones, or have been taking up the sofa by the entrance with a friend to socialise with them.  I think this lackadaisical approach is what could be leading to the poor etiquette by patrons.  During my last visit it seemed as though there were a number of people who were not staying within the slot they had booked for.  I don't think policing this sort of thing is nice for anyone, but if the slots are all booked up, it leads to a poor experience for everyone.  I think a bit of a time reminder for everyone wouldn't hurt.  For a sauna that charges a little more per visit compared to others, this experience is really subpar.   The facilities aren't bad and I wish the etiquette was better - I think there are absolutely ways to improve the experience, and I really hope issues are corrected soon.  Otherwise, I would just travel further for a nicer experience.",

          "reviewText": "I have been here a few times now.  My most recent visit was a bit shocking.  There is little to no sauna etiquette from other patrons.  The single sauna was over crowded, and people were leaving their towels in the sauna to claim seats.  It was deeply uncomfortable and not very considerate.  The staff seem like genuine friendly people but they don't really say much upon arrival as most of the staff I've met have either been on the phone to a friend wearing headphones, or have been taking up the sofa by the entrance with a friend to socialise with them.  I think this lackadaisical approach is what could be leading to the poor etiquette by patrons.  During my last visit it seemed as though there were a number of people who were not staying within the slot they had booked for.

They have multiple cold plunge pools and even cold showers, which is amazing if you’re into cold therapy. The whole place has such a calm, rejuvenating vibe, and the staff were super friendly, which made the experience even better. Definitely a new go-to for me!",

Cleanliness and hygiene clearly is not a priority for the staff at the gym.\n\nFirst of all the sanitisation stations on the gym floor (of which there are nowhere near enough) are almost always empty of spray, or the paper has run out. The staff do not fill these up frequently enough, so you cannot wipe down equipment before/after use….gross.\n\nSecond, the changing rooms and shower facilities are horrendous . The drains STINK SO BAD it makes me feel sick. The smell hits you as soon as you enter the changing rooms. And the showers are FILTHY, just look at the photos. The showers have a serious drain fly infestation, as I often find several flies sharing the shower with me in the mornings. The showers are not regularly descaled. Mould is growing in the cubicles, and they’re just generally filled with dirt and muck.\n\nIm a regular visitor to this gym and I often see the cleaners in the changing rooms doing no cleaning whatsoever, they just sit down chatting on the phone, clearly not talking about work. Ive never seen a cleaner present who actually cleans, and the lack of hygiene just reflects that. It’s absolutely disgusting. There needs to be a major overhaul in the cleaning/hygiene of this gym.\n\n**edit**\n\nI wrote a review on this place about 9 months ago saying how dirty it is, and unfortunately nothing much has changed since.\n\nCleaning appears to be non-existent in this gym. Just one example, ontop of the various ones I mentioned in my previous review above. the sanitary bins in the female changing rooms are left overflowing, (see photo attached) which is straight up disgusting??? How do the staff let hygiene standards get this low?\n\nThe cleaning stations are always either missing spray or tissue, theres hardly ever both present. So you can rarely wipe down your equipment because the staff don’t replenish the cleaning stations. This is on-top of the changing room toilets, which often lack any soap, so you can’t actually wash your hands most of the time!?!?\n\nWithin the entrance to the gym, before the one way turnstile pods, most days there are usually homeless people camping out, using drugs and whatnot. This creates a very unwelcoming environment, as you need to walk right past to actually access the gym floor. The staff seem to do absolutely nothing about this, as this happens almost everyday I enter the gym. On the rare occasions there aren’t any homeless people, the rubbish they leave in the entrance is not cleaned by staff, looping back to the poor hygiene standards….\n\nI wish i didn’t have to go to this gym, but unfortunately theres not much choice in the area, as this puregym is the only commercial gym in Finsbury park. I suspect this is why this gym is so poor, because there is practically no competition nearby. Thank god GymBox has FINALLY announced they will be opening around the corner in the summer, I cant wait to leave this place, and go to a gym that actually has hygiene and cleaning standards.",

A workout that would normally take a maximum of 45 minutes easily turns into 1h30m due to machine waiting time.\n\nThe machines are outdated, and the weight area remains tiny (the same problem as the previous gym brand in the same location).

You’d think after covid (arguably still ongoing), providing sanitising products would be mandatory. It is a health hazard in my opinion. The changing rooms are tidy but the choice of furniture is so odd! The bench is made of three wooden sticks with huge gaps which make sitting very uncomfortable. Plus they put rows of hooks right above the bench which could be ok for jackets but people hang their underwear and sweaty clothes on these hooks. All very unhygienic. The gym doesn’t always have staff onsite which makes me think what would happen if there was an emergency. It is remotely monitored but from who knows where. I guess you’ll have to rely on a member knowing CPR when it happens. The gym music is often too loud and I have to turn up the volume in my headphones even louder. I guess you get what you pay for.",

The equipment is always clean and well-maintained, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is super motivating. The space is so big and there is a lot of equipment available. Another thing to mention is that this gym is run my camera’s so there’s no staff in the gym 24/7, they are watching on the camera’s. The only staff you see in the gym are the personal trainers and class leaders.\n\nThere’s also a great sense of community here people are respectful and focused, and there’s a supportive vibe that makes it easy to stay consistent. The locker rooms are clean and well-stocked, but the parking options here are quite poor. Most of them are Monday - Sunday 9:00am - 11:00pm or Monday - Sunday 9:00am - 9:00pm. Even if you do come in between those times all the parking spaces are always full.\n\nThe gym group app is very useful. They have lots of different work out and stretches for you to choose from so you can create your own gym routine, and create your own list. You can set goals, book classes and book personal trainers aswell. The app also lets you know how many people are at the gym.",

So you can easily become trapped inside.\n\nAs with most commercial gyms, there are not enough squat racks so you’ll probably have to wait. Even when the gym is at 40% capacity you’ll have almost no luck getting any equipment. If it’s over 30% personally I will avoid it.\n\nThe gym is very disorganised. Plates are left all over the place, in no order. Bumper plates are mixed in with machine plates. Some racks and machines have no plates, others have a bizarre distribution. Clips and collars left all over. Barbells get used by people for hip thrusts and just left on the floor instead of being returned.\n\nThe gym does not provide paper towel or wipes, so bring your own and remember most other users do not clean up their own sweat.\n\nThere are no bands, pvc pipes or dowels etc for warming up and only one technique (8kg) barbell and one womens weight barbell (15kg). But they do have bumper plates and lifting platforms so it’s ok for Weightlifting if you get a rack.\n\nNot sure what time they clean, but when I arrive at 6:30ish there are often many empty cans and bottles on the floor as well as other general litter.",

Facilities and supplies are plentiful and staff were not only very polite and friendly, but also falling over themselves to help with whatever I asked. Food looked and smelled amazing (I was gutted to be completely devoid of any sort of an appetite during my visit) and was very reasonably priced indeed. I cannot believe that in 4 years of truck driving I’ve never been here before - I’ll definitely be making an effort to stop here again! Can’t recommend it enough.",

First of all a congratulations to all the staff on site, I engaged with ground staff who were at the fuel pumps, shop staff, the catering team in the restaurant and visited the truck wash.\n\nOn arrival, my purpose of the visit was to refuel, quick shower, some breakfast and wash my truck. All of which were the result of my eroute @SNAP app. Fuel pumps were easily accessible with over head canopy at 5m height restriction.\n\nKeyfuels, UK fuels and Silvey Fuel cards accepted with loads of information boards encouraging you to sign up to the Onroute app and collect loyalty points which can be reclaimed onsite as discounts towards purchases, and 50% off your first restaurant order. A few minutes later my app was installed and breakfast ordered whilst stood at the fuel pumps!\n\nParked up and next on the agenda was a quick shower. Straight into the shower block which was spotlessly clean on entry with a separate changing and drying area. A bit old school but better than trying to dress on a wet floor. Striped off and wondered into the shower cubicle to find a vending machine at the shower with a notice to buy a token from the shop at £2.50 for the pleasure. I was sorely tempted to walk back out naked to get my token but decided as time was of the essence and my breakfast was being cooked, to dismiss the shower for now. Perhaps moving the notice to the shower door would be advised? As a result no review to the showers or the hot water, but looking at the shower curtains, stained and tired looking, we’ll leave that there.\n\nThe shop staff, stock available and friendly engagement was first class. I picked up some Tacho rolls and paid via Apple Pay at the till and was given a receipt without asking. Conversations were flowing and a happy environment - 10/10.\n\nIn the foyer and just outside the front door with the usual slot machines and laundry facilities, all working and available for use.  Plenty more information on hand about facilities on offer and selection of advertising.\n\nInto the restaurant and again a joyful atmosphere with happy staff and a greeting by another member of staff ensuring I had downloaded the Onroute app and even offered me a fuel card application for silvey - nice touch. Food was presented bang on time as per the app order, was piping hot and further enquiries if I needed anything else, which I didn’t. They catered for everything. Very well done 10/10.\n\nAfter breakfast I retired with my coffee to the seating area outside for my cigarette and the smoking area was fully accessible, clean and tidy.\n\nFinally the truck wash, which was the purpose of the visit. I departed Driffield in Yorkshire on route to the South West and my collected trailer was black. It was supposed to be white!  Logging into the Snap app my first available truck wash on route was here. So this was a fairly integral part of my visit. You can imagine my disappointment to pull up and find it abandoned and closed. 0/10\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience, not sure if the truck wash is permanently closed but it’s let the site down in its overall scores.",

          "reviewText": "Wow! Onroute Truckstops have been very busy at Swindon! What an amazing difference! My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.  Signage to parking was clear and concise, and there was ample space available.  Traffic flow was moderate and free.\n\nFirst engagement was the canteen, by which entry was via a newly developed entrance.  Stunning.  New groundwork’s was colourful and very pleasing to the eye.  There were new picnic tables positioned outside - and were being used.  New plants were positioned, giving the homely welcome.  A huge effort has been made to greet customers to this area and the transformation from the old side entrance is worlds apart.  There are new big screens displaying menus, new information points, leaflets, all safety measures present, serviceable, in date and correctly placed where applicable.\n\nI met ‘Claire’ behind the counter, who was welcoming, bright and bubbly and just what you need to lift your spirits from the drama and stress of the highways. Also in attendance were approximately 4 other staff and the whole food counter experience was top class.  A very nice touch was a bowl of free healthy fruit for visitors. Well done there.  Food service was very quick - top marks.\n\nThe canteen was spotless. There were plenty of customers throughout the day (I was there for a 24hr stop) and I watched with interest the positive energy this team had going on. Everyone was greeted with a welcome and a smile.  No name badges though, I’d like to have seen that - it’s a more personal presentation to thank someone and show appreciation by referring to them by name. It’s also awkward to have to ask, maybe this should be considered. On the opposite side of the coin it equally encourages staff to deliver excellence as it’s much easier to identify individual failings. Certainly not the case here today however.\n\nNo sooner had a diner finished a staff member was instantly on hand to clean and disinfect and prepare the space for the next customer.  There was also excellent promotion and encouragement by the staff to download and use the Onroute app.\n\nFeedback: drivers are still struggling to find the SNAP terminals to pay for parking and are constantly having to queue and ask at the counter, disrupting staff from the catering flow.  The terminals hidden away in the toilet corridor and are not signed. A staff member had put a handwritten sign on the access door to highlight the location but was told by management to take it down. This was a poor decision and negatively impacted good staff initiative.  It may not have been ideal or as professional as a custom branded sign, but it was better than nothing!  There is still no clear signage to the SNAP payment terminals and needs addressed for full score achievement.\n\nThe shop was well stocked and inviting. It’s bright and has most of the essentials needed for drivers. As soon as I approached the shop a member of staff was there to assist if needed. I made several purchases and the whole experience again was very good.\n\nThe toilet corridor from the canteen leads to access snap terminals, ladies, gents and disabled toilets, and showers.  It was clean, fresh, clear of debris; and both snap terminals were fully functional. All fire safety measures were present, in date and clearly identified.  Health & Safety measures were also in place and being used effectively.\n\nUnfortunately I can’t give any further details as I’ve run out of characters! Happy to be contacted if necessary. Staff deserve special credit for a near perfect experience. Well done. Very well done.",

It's now a very small space in which the drivers eat compared to previously. Showers and toilets get the thumbs up though. I've eaten better food for less money. Next time I'll go to Sainsbury's next door and just buy something from there, it will be tastier than what I had. Do something about that soup, it's really bad, it was the vegetable soup and it was like someone just decided it would be best to use the old vegetables up by making a soup. The chef can't be happy, or doesn't have a tasting spoon. A dreary 1 star. Overall the old place was better for space. It feels cramped with 10 people in there",

I wasn’t the only driver to have this problem . probably around 20 or so trucks there .

It is now our go to place for staying in London. 15 mins bus ride from Waterloo station, clean rooms (a little tired) good breakfast and towel hire.\n\nStaff are lovely. Sometimes it's a bit noisy and busy, but not too bad for a hostel.\n\nFor 4 people in our own room with own toilet, £50 per night is unbeatable.",

I saw a few mixed reviews, but honestly thought it was in my top hostel experiences! It's certainly not a new and flashy hostel, but a comfortable, well thought out and safe space for women to stay. The 14-bed dorm I stayed in was not very spacious but I had a curtain and the bunk bed was sturdy and didn't rock about. The showers and toilets were clean. Both receptionists I came across were really relaxed and friendly. As for location in London, it's a little way out. But it's very close to Bethnel Green tube station (2-min walk) and there are a couple of very cool beer and wine spots within 5-minute walking distance. Overall just feels very comfortable being around women who are there for the same reasons as you. Will defo be back! Many thanks.",

The hostel was dirty, and both receptionists I interacted with were unhelpful and surprisingly indifferent. Not the supportive, welcoming atmosphere you would expect from a women-only hostel. When I arrived early on Friday morning, the receptionist stayed on her phone, offered no guidance, and barely acknowledged me.\n\nWhen I got to the room, there was no heating, and later, when I went to shower, the water was ice-cold. The bathroom was freezing, making the whole experience extremely uncomfortable.\n\nFor a place that advertises safety, comfort, and understanding for women, this hostel fell far short. I cannot recommend Hostelle. Even basic cleanliness, warmth, and respectful staff interaction were lacking. After staying there for 2 hours, I ended up booking another place that was way better than Hostelle.\n\nYou can see in the pictures: 1)  There was a dirty Kleenex left on the floor right next to my bed — completely unacceptable. 2) There was what looked like hair and even an old pistachio on the floor right next to my bed — completely unacceptable.",

The location is great, just a 10 minute walk from Tower Bridge and Tower of London, which is also a Circle and District line station, making travel around the city very easy. Check in was simple, and the rooms have pretty comfy bunk beds with assigned lockers to store your things. Everything was clean and tidy, and the staff were very kind should you want to replace your towels or linens or anything. The shower is notably wonderful -- great pressure and temperature. We were lucky enough to get a room with a view out onto this gorgeous church next door! There's fans in each bunk if you're too hot, and radiators if you're too cold. The bar downstairs only opens at 6, but it's a great spot to hang out with lots of mat-covered benches, a pool table, and an L-shaped bar in this cool arched brick space, staffed by super cool and friendly people (shoutout to Cassie here!) and full of friendly fellow patrons who are happy to chat to anyone in the vicinity. Laundry was somewhat expensive at 5 pounds a load for washing, but they provide detergent which was a godsend, and let's be honest, this is London. The cafe near reception has great coffee, and a variety of pastries, as well as a nice little sit-down, bookshelf-laden area to enjoy them. I'd recommend them any day, and will likely be booking back in again in the near future! Thanks so much Wombat!",

          "reviewText": "This might be one of the nicest and most affordable hostels I've ever stayed in. All the staff were lovely. The rooms were nice and clean. The curtains and lockers on the bunk beds were fantastic. As a single woman traveling alone, it felt very comfortable and safe. The hostel has a bar, a guest kitchen, a garden, a laundry room, and a café. The bar area, in particular, is very spacious and has an event almost every evening. The bar prices aren't expensive. The hostel's location is also excellent, about a 5-6 minute walk from Tower Hill station. The Circle and District lines run from there, making it very convenient. I think it's about the same distance from Aldgate East station, which also has Hammersmith & City and the Overground. It's very close to Tower Bridge, so I bought breakfast every morning and ate it by the bridge.\n\nHowever, the sink being right next to the shower is a bit of a problem. You can’t wash your hands while someone else is showering. I think this problem would be eliminated if the shower cabin was made of an opaque material rather than glass and had a door.",

Great location in a lovely neighbourhood away from the usual tourist traps of London and well connected for transport. We booked the Crown because of its location to events we were attending which were awesome but honestly the highlight of our weekend was spending time at the pub itself because the staff were so lovely and welcoming. Can’t wait to stay there again",

          "reviewText": "Alice is a phenomenal coach. I always disliked being in water and could not go beyond moving for 5 meters or so in a frantic puppy style. But I decided to challenge myself and overcome my fear. Alice has been a major help in achieving this and helped me get to the point that I thought could never reach. Now I can confidently swim 35 meters or so with front crawl, on back, and head-up breaststroke. Not only Alice is knowledgeable and highly skilled as a teacher, but also very perceptive and flexible, making each session meaningful and rewarding.  It is such a joy to work with her, I genuinely look forward to each session.  As a teacher myself, I truly know Alice is an outstanding and excellent coach, and I really can’t recommend her enough to anyone who wants to become a confident swimmer.  I decided to keep working with Alice and go for the breaststroke course, which I am very much looking forward to.\n\nRegarding their teaching approach: I finished the learn-to-swim course, which is impressively methodical and effective.  I didn’t know anything about swimming, so initially, I wasn’t sure what I was getting into, but I decided to trust the system. And for me, it worked like magic. What’s amazing about the course is that they compartmentalise essential elements in swimming and make you master them one by one. What this means is that I am now able to detect what’s wrong with my swimming when something isn’t working, and to correct myself.   I am now training on my own to extend the distance on front/back, and I actually get to be flexible and I’m able to effectively tweak different elements to make them suit my body/condition. This is because I understand the fundamentals, thanks to the course.  I very clearly see and feel the effect of their teaching method, and I am truly impressed.\n\nMariko",

Changing rooms and gym floor is always clean and the pool is an excellent addition to relax in if you fancy changing up your routine. Beats the chain gyms hands down!",

My monthly rolling membership will increase from £51 to £69 as of Feb '25, a 35% increase.  Given the service has actually worsened, there are no changing rooms, the toilet is external to the facility, the pool/sauna/steam room/tennis courts are still not ready despite the refurbishment having started in 2021, the increase is unacceptable & many long-standing members have decided to leave the club for other better options nearby.  I'm considering leaving also, despite the fact that I've been coming to DSQ for about 6 years **\n\nI've been coming to DSQ fitness club for a few years.\n\nBefore the ongoing refurb started, I really loved coming to the Yoga classes (especially Leticia's Yin Yoga ones), to the swimming pool/sauna/steam room, and to the gym for PT sessions.  I used to buy the guest passes in bulk, as the membership wasn't convenient for me. I also used to often use the Hammam Spa, which was just an amazing place to really decompress.\n\nSince the refurb started, I've now started being a member & I mainly come for Yoga (Leticia, Federica, Sahara, Antonia), Pilates (Violetta), PT sessions (Karen). I also sometimes do Yogalates (Angee), when schedule allows.  Sal, the manager, is cool & normally on top of things.\n\nI really like the instructors - so I will keep coming.\n\nThe new booking system is pretty glitchy, and comms re the refurb are non-existent.  Defo something that could be improved.  It would be such an improvement also if the lights in the Yoga studios could be changed to enable them to be dimmed.\n\nI can't wait for the pool, steam room and sauna to be open again.\n\nI'm aware that the Hammam Spa won't re-open, which is a real shame - it was a gem of a place, with a lovely team.  I've spent far too much money there!!\n\nAll in all, pretty happy customer.",

The gym facilities are fairly outdated, lockers jam on their own on a daily basis, and I'm pretty sure everyone that go there knows about this. So, I have to go to the reception and get help, instead of being helpful. All I got was attitude filled responses like, 'Do you even know how to use the lockers? *with an eye roll*'. The changing room is fairly dirty, towel every, damp and 8 out of 10 showers have some sort broken parts (broken locks, broke shower head, flies infested) that's been unfixed for months. The gym membership claims that there's free towel service and it has been fine for months since I joined. However, today I got told by a receptionist that I will have to pay an extra fee for using more than two of the towels that they provide on the reception desk. OUT OF NOWHERE! It was not written on the terms and conditions, nor specified by the staff when they handed me the contract to sign for the gym membership. So it feels like it's just some made up rules that they're using to patronize me while I AM THE PAYING CUSTOMER!\nSo overall, I highly would not recommend this place to anyone who's looking into joining. Since you won't be getting the customer service nor gym experience that you should expect for the price of the membership.",

There’s a real sense of community here that you just don’t find everywhere.

People regularly leave weights lying around instead of putting them back—expecting someone new or less strong to unload multiple 25 kg plates from a barbell or leg press is unreasonable.\n\nDumbbells are often left scattered on the floor near benches, creating obvious trip hazards. If someone were to fall or injure themselves because of this, it could easily lead to legal action. Safety should be taken seriously. If someone is strong enough to lift the weights to use them, there’s no excuse for not racking them properly afterward.\n\nI also can’t stand how some people have no respect for personal space or hygiene—including groups of students and Uber drivers who seem more interested in staring at women than actually training.\n\nI understand people need to rest between sets, but it’s frustrating when they take 10 minutes just staring at their phones or having long conversations, with no regard for others waiting to use the machine.\n\nOn top of that, some of the equipment is badly in need of maintenance or replacement. For example, one of the calf raise machines feels like the bearings are shot, and the loading pole on the leg press is so angled it looks like the plates could fall off at any moment.\n\nOverall, the entire branch feels neglected and seems to be relying solely on the JD Gyms name to keep attracting members.

They make me feel welcome every time and its always nice seeing them. I love that they have boxing bags which not many gyms have. Free lockers, hand sanitizer, wet wipes etc. to keep us safe. Overall for the monthly membership price, cant complain!!\n\nUpdate 2023: Sorry, had to leave this gym. Like every budget gym and now I don’t know if this one is worse because of the location but sadly people do not take care of equipments here. Most equipments are grim and the one spin bike at the front, the saddle is completely broken. I can say more but let’s just leave it as that.",

Sofia is an exceptional teacher and coach. She is incredibly knowledgeable, supportive, and attentive to every individual, regardless of fitness level. Her communication is clear, motivating, and encouraging, making each session both productive and enjoyable. She takes the time to correct form, explain exercises properly, and adapt workouts to suit your goals and abilities.\n\nSofia creates a positive and welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable and motivated to push themselves.

There are ONLY 2 SHOWER CUBICLES so it's not exactly hard to maintain some sort of cleaning standard because it's clear to see these showers have been abandoned for a WHILE. They are very big cubicles with just a small shower and sink I think space could of been utilised better with additional showers but not if they end up the way these are left to rot.\nBeside the shower, there was a foul smell in the toilets (not just a public toilet smell) it just seems so unkept.

You need to wash your dishes in the kitchen. You can also cook for yourself and store your food in fridges! Tea and coffee is available until kitchen closes.\n\nTheres no AC but fans everywhere! You will feel chill with these.\n\nLuggage room is also very practical and its great they have CCTV.\n\nI paid for mixed room but all were men so I asked for a women room since I wouldn't like to be only woman in a mixed room. They helped me to switch my room! Beda are comfortable. The bedsheets are super clean and nicely ironed. Under beds there are locking cage area and this is the best to fit your belongings. Its always good to being your own lock yet they still can help you with this.\n\nReception seems not very good tho. Still you may access wifi by only registering your email address.\n\n15 mins to Victoria Station. Easy to walk around for historical and cultural places.\n\nThank you!",

Then once I had a booking for a higher price than I originally booked I ended up with a family room (multiple folding beds with no space between beds) that was very smelly and not cleaned well (pubic hair on the toilet seat and in the bowl and mould on the shower tiles).

Nice little playground for kids, a decent size swimming pool at a good temperature and a lovely sauna too. There is also a little convenience shop on site I packed everything I needed so didn't go inside but it looked well stocked up. The reason I have given 3 stars is because the cabin we had was very dirty, from dirty towels, floor and carpet full of hair, the sofa was a terrible discolouration from dirt and the shower was gross. When we did complain it took so long for them to come out and sort it by the time they came to clean we just wanted the new towels instead. The video shows the marks in the bathroom can come off that it's not stuck on mould. Overall I would still be willing to visit the park again in the hopes of a better cabin as that was the main thing that let us down",

Theres no shop on site so bring your own milk etc… but there’s is shop a 4 minute drive away so it’s not a big deal There’s a beautiful swimming pool which I used every day which also has a sauna again very clean. The staffs are so friendly nothings too much trouble. I would definitely recommend The grounds are well kept. Beautiful pubs and restaurants nearby . Thank you so much for a lovely holiday we will be back",

The bridal walks and drives through the area are beautiful. If you stayed here you would need to be able to drive but that wasn’t as issue for us as we loved how rural it was.\nNow to the caravan park itself. It looks impressive and the facilities of the tennis court and play area are fine. The swimming pool was a great activity to do on days you want to stay around and not venture off site. I will say however, it wasn’t the cleanest. Other than that it was ‘fine’\nNow onto my main gripe, the property itself. Now, my family and I have stayed in many lodges and this was our second using hoeseasons. The first lodge we stayed at was perfect and we had no complaints, the property really lived up to its value. This one however was a disappointment. When paying for a ‘superior’ holiday lodge one can’t help but have certain expectations. We were left a little deflated when entering the property, and even viewing from the outside we could see it was in need of some TLC. Our decking on the whole road of other lodges was by far the worst and falling apart. The inside of the lodge wasn’t much better, extremely dated with patches of damp and torn walls. The floor wasn’t much better with frayed and bunched carpets. A huge ugly stain by the main bed was very unsightly, felt like wax and I dread to think what it actually was. The beds and sofa were also extremely used and in need of replacing. Not overly cleaned well and the walls were stained. Features within the lodge didn’t work either, the kettle was a hazard and leaked so we didn’t use it, the extractor fan above the oven didn’t work, the bath was faulty and the DVD player was only there for show as it didn’t work. It was mostly the appearance of the property and all these little things not working added up which made me realise it wasn’t worth the value we paid. Although we made the most of the holiday, we had a lovely time, I wouldn’t stay again and I certainly expect more from a ‘superior’ lodge.",

Heated out door swimming pool, driving range, mini golf, pitch and put, bike hire, the list goes on. On site fish and chips and restaurant was very good value. Evening entertainment was good and we won on the cash bingo. The only thing that I will say was that our caravan was very near the complex and could be quite loud in the evenings. Not a problem for us but anyone with young kids trying to get them to sleep might struggle with the noise a bit. But a great stay and would recommend to anyone to stay here. Oh and this place is literally on a beach, it was less than a 2 minute walk from our caravan and we were more or less the centre of the campsite",

It comes with much more space than a caravan, wrap around decking and our lodge had 3 bathrooms which was great as 6 of us were staying here. The clubhouse is nice with beautiful views of the lakes. My 2 children (1 and 5 Yr) enjoyed watching all the birds. We didn't eat at the clubhouse, go swimming (which did look nice and not overcrowded) or make it to the entertainment as our Lodge was perfect for our needs. WiFi is available to purchase in the lodge and worth noting to check what time the shop opens - we went a few times and it was closed. The only thing I would say is unfortunately there were a few 'big kids' that were being a bit unruly in the play park, wrapping the swings over the bar and trying to break the play equipment, which was a shame. The reception team were really pleasant, all in all a lovely weekend break.\n\nI only gave a 4 star due to the support from Beth at Park Holidays Central team before we arrived. My 1yr old was in hospital (Mon - Wed) and we were due to arrive on the Friday. I emailed the support team to explain the situation and we were still hoping to make our holiday but if my little boy had to go into theatre we wouldn't be able to come. I asked in this circumstance, would it be possible to move the date. (Lodge is pricey and we had treated my parents so it was a special holiday for us) Beth said this couldn't be done and so we would basically have to loose the holiday if we didn't show. Beth's emails were unsympathetic and the holiday unfortunately wasn't a priority at that point due to the hospital situation but it put even more of a dampener on the worries that we were going through. It would of been nice if there was the support there from Park Holidays and opportunity to move the date, if my son had to of gone in for an operation. Thankfully he didn't have to and was feeling much more like himself come the weekend / holiday.",

There is a small park and an even smaller pool which got really busy so we didn’t use it. The arcade was the only other attraction and a few machines were out of order. The toilet/shower block was just okay, it often got a bit grubby and could do with more regular cleans but in saying that the doors are supposed to be kept locked and used only by residents of the park - nobody adhered to this so they were open for all meaning it’s harder to keep up with cleaning. For the price the camping pod was good value and a lovely base to explore the area.",

These messages have been ignored entirely, without even a basic acknowledgement. To make matters worse, a promised phone call from management over a week ago never happened, and no explanation or follow-up was provided.\n\nThis level of disregard for customers is unacceptable. Clear, timely communication should be a minimum standard for any business, yet Park Holidays has failed to meet even that. It is frustrating, unprofessional, and has caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.\n\nBased on our experience, I cannot recommend Park Holidays to anyone who values reliable customer service or accountability from management.\n\nTo compound matters, the caravan itself was in an appalling state on arrival. It was filthy, with a strong, unpleasant smell that was immediately noticeable. There were stains that appeared to be from urine and the general condition fell far below any reasonable hygiene or presentation standard for holiday accommodation.\n\nThis combination of poor customer service and unacceptable cleanliness is disgraceful.

          "reviewText": "Caravan was very run down. Holes in walls and door missing. Caravan floor was filthy. Cleaner came to hoover the carpet but as she was using a Henry hoover it was mostly flattening the hair and dust on the carpet rather than sucking it up. We found a sock and golf ball that weren't ours so this highlights how thorough the cleaning was done. The plugs were for show only as they didn't fit the plug holes. No net curtains which other caravan parks have so very limited privacy and caravans were closer together compared to other sites we have stayed at. The pool was disgusting, baby pool closed with no reason as to why. This led to the main pool being overcrowded and meant the toddler in our group couldn't really enjoy the pool. There was black mould / dirt at the bottom of the pool and we went there in the morning so wouldn't have been from that day's use. Too few changing areas. We didn't use the pool again which was disappointing as swimming is one of the activities the kids look forward to.\n\nToilets in the swimming pool were also used by arts and crafts so were covered in paint. We went into these in the morning on 2 occasions and both times they were filthy and had no soap.\n\nThe clubhouse was also filthy. We attended a children's activity in the morning and the tables, floor and bar area were sticky and clearly hadn't been cleaned from the night before. Again the toilets in the clubhouse had no soap.\n\nWe ordered drinks using the App and waited nearly an hour for these. Clearly there were not enough staff to serve at the bar and also deal with orders online. When our drinks finally arrived they had been substituted without an apology or explanation, we had to enquire why our drinks weren't what we ordered. They were meant to be frozen cocktails but had clearly been sitting around for a while as they had melted.\n\nThere was dog poo by the clubhouse for 3 days. It only disappeared once the area flooded due to the rain.\n\nThe smell of cannabis was overpowering. Security guards acknowledged it but didn't seem to be doing anything about it.\n\nSecurity guards on the clubhouse doors let small children run out without an adult.\n\nThe crafts activities we participated in weren't very well organised. We were left to work out what to do by ourselves. No instructions and very limited interaction. Other parks have made these experiences more interactive for children.\n\nThe fish and chip shop, ice cream place and chicken take away weren't open despite this being a busy time of year due to school hols. The restaurant was very slow and again seemed to be running on skeleton staff. This left us no choice but to eat off site.\n\nVery limited things to do during the day and especially when it is raining. No soft play or free activities to do.\n\nWe hired 2 travel cots and a highchair and these were in our caravan upon arrival. However, we couldn't set up the travel cots as we weren't able to move the beds ourselves. No note to explain this or who to contact.

          "reviewText": "Caravan was very run down. Holes in walls and door missing. Caravan floor was filthy. Cleaner came to hoover the carpet but as she was using a Henry hoover it was mostly flattening the hair and dust on the carpet rather than sucking it up. We found a sock and golf ball that weren't ours so this highlights how thorough the cleaning was done. The plugs were for show only as they didn't fit the plug holes. No net curtains which other caravan parks have so very limited privacy and caravans were closer together compared to other sites we have stayed at. The pool was disgusting, baby pool closed with no reason as to why. This led to the main pool being overcrowded and meant the toddler in our group couldn't really enjoy the pool. There was black mould / dirt at the bottom of the pool and we went there in the morning so wouldn't have been from that day's use. Too few changing areas. We didn't use the pool again which was disappointing as swimming is one of the activities the kids look forward to.\n\nToilets in the swimming pool were also used by arts and crafts so were covered in paint. We went into these in the morning on 2 occasions and both times they were filthy and had no soap.\n\nThe clubhouse was also filthy. We attended a children's activity in the morning and the tables, floor and bar area were sticky and clearly hadn't been cleaned from the night before. Again the toilets in the clubhouse had no soap.\n\nWe ordered drinks using the App and waited nearly an hour for these. Clearly there were not enough staff to serve at the bar and also deal with orders online. When our drinks finally arrived they had been substituted without an apology or explanation, we had to enquire why our drinks weren't what we ordered. They were meant to be frozen cocktails but had clearly been sitting around for a while as they had melted.\n\nThere was dog poo by the clubhouse for 3 days. It only disappeared once the area flooded due to the rain.\n\nThe smell of cannabis was overpowering. Security guards acknowledged it but didn't seem to be doing anything about it.\n\nSecurity guards on the clubhouse doors let small children run out without an adult.\n\nThe crafts activities we participated in weren't very well organised. We were left to work out what to do by ourselves. No instructions and very limited interaction. Other parks have made these experiences more interactive for children.\n\nThe fish and chip shop, ice cream place and chicken take away weren't open despite this being a busy time of year due to school hols. The restaurant was very slow and again seemed to be running on skeleton staff. This left us no choice but to eat off site.\n\nVery limited things to do during the day and especially when it is raining. No soft play or free activities to do.\n\nWe hired 2 travel cots and a highchair and these were in our caravan upon arrival.

The single beds in the caravan were compact, but otherwise, the accommodation was acceptable. Furthermore, the resort featured a restaurant and an entertainment hall, providing relaxation options for adults. The location is strategically advantageous, offering convenient access to the beach, shopping centers, and piers via readily available transportation. Various caravan sizes are available to accommodate diverse family requirements, with pricing dependent on the caravan's grade, ranging from bronze to gold. Given the positive experience, are caravan ownership opportunities under consideration? They are certainly attractive.",

There are many good, even great things about it: the manager obviously means well and is striving to do a good job; post-renovation, there is better use of the available space (even if there is still not enough equipment); cleanliness is always decent; the personal trainers are capable and reliable (and queuing to use the equipment); the reception staff are always efficient (if not exactly smiling); the cafe run by Mustafa and his colleague is fantastic; and last but not least, it remains an affordable local gym.  However, there is also vast room for improvement.  My three main issues are the awful air conditioning, the awful smell in the ladies’ changing rooms, and the fact that this place really needs to prioritize maintaining its character as a community hub.\nOn days of heatwave, of which we are having many, the main gym area turns into a sauna and it is suffocating.  The leisure centres at Camberwell and Elephant & Castle in the meantime are a cool oasis.  So why is this?  Apparently, at Dulwich the renovation budget was blown by the fact they needed to remove asbestos.  Well, thank you for that, but we also don’t want to die of a heart attack any more than we want to die of asbestos poisoning. To replace the existing air conditioning system, they need to move it with a crane and therefore need to close the local roads.  Why is this such a big problem?  The road is often blocked because water pipes burst and flood the area, they can’t close the road for a few hours to finish the job?!\nSecondly, the extensive renovation didn’t cover the changing rooms and the stink in the ladies’ one, especially the first area as you come in, is as powerful as it is permanent.\nFinally, I don’t like the fact that they removed seating to install the mostly useless Library of Things.  I used to love the fact that the more elderly users of the centre would take a seat on the comfortable chairs and sofa and have a chat after their seniors’ classes.  Now the available space is halved and tables really should be used by those who buy a coffee.  Sorry, but you are not doing your job properly here, Southwark Council.  Apart from fitness, a leisure centre is a place to meet other people, a reason to get out of the house, particularly for the elderly.  You can rent a hedge trimmer from your local hardware store, you don’t need the community leisure centre to fulfill that function.  So, so disappointing that they could not see all that.  So, thank you for your efforts, but please try harder.",

The Canada Water Leisure Centre is a brand new facility beautifully designed, modern, and full of potential .  but it’s being completely let down by poor management and terrible cleanliness.\n\nI am a member here and have already spoken to the reception and asked to speak with a manager about the cleaning standards. Unfortunately, nothing seems to improve. The men’s changing room and bathroom in the gym area are disgusting. The floors are filthy and covered in black marks, the toilets have stains and splashes on the walls, and the sinks are often dirty. There’s often no soap, no detergent, and sometimes not even toilet paper.\n\nThe shower area is just as bad. The floors are not properly washed  they are simply hoovered or mopped over, which is unacceptable in an area where people are barefoot. There’s no deep cleaning, and it’s clearly unhygienic. It’s a shame to see a brand new installation already being left to deteriorate like this.\n\nAnother serious issue is the strong smell of drains that hits you as soon as you walk into the reception area. When the gym doors open, you can smell it immediately . it’s a horrible, toilet-like odour that varies in intensity from day to day. I’ve mentioned this to reception several times, and other members I’ve spoken to have also complained. They say they’re “taking action,” but the smell keeps coming back, sometimes even stronger.\n\nIt’s such a disappointment because the facility itself is beautiful, but the management clearly doesn’t care about maintaining it. There are plenty of staff around, yet no one seems to take responsibility or ensure proper cleaning. This centre desperately needs professional supervision and a serious deep-cleaning routine before it becomes completely neglected.",

When the gym doors open, you can smell it immediately . it’s a horrible, toilet-like odour that varies in intensity from day to day. I’ve mentioned this to reception several times, and other members I’ve spoken to have also complained. They say they’re “taking action,” but the smell keeps coming back, sometimes even stronger.\n\nIt’s such a disappointment because the facility itself is beautiful, but the management clearly doesn’t care about maintaining it. There are plenty of staff around, yet no one seems to take responsibility or ensure proper cleaning. This centre desperately needs professional supervision and a serious deep-cleaning routine before it becomes completely neglected.",

I believe that needs to change! So I’ll be downgrading my stars rating Canada Water’s new super leisure centre is a game changer! (I don’t get the negative reviews, you guys seriously need to go out more)\n\nI had the chance to tour the brand-new Canada Water Leisure Centre on opening day, and honestly, it exceeded my expectations. The facilities are top-notch: two pools — a full 25m eight-lane pool and a teaching pool with a moveable floor. The gym is packed with cutting-edge kit like Speedflex machines, which I can’t wait to try more.\n\nWhat really stood out was the multipurpose sports hall — you can rent it for badminton, tennis, five-a-side football, and basketball, making it perfect for groups and community activities.\n\nA big thank you to Phillipa for the wonderful tour — the staff are genuinely friendly and welcoming. I also joined a meditation class and was impressed to see frequency bowls for sound included. It added something unique, though personally I’d also love to see a quieter session focused just on breathwork. The meditation space itself is gorgeous, with calming blue lights that create a really peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThey also run group cycling classes, though these weren’t available during my visit because they were filming. I was told you need to book classes through their app, ideally well in advance, since demand is already high.\n\nI noticed the age group skewed a little older (around 40–50+), which surprised me, but it actually made the vibe even more friendly and community-oriented.\n\nAnd let’s not forget: memberships for locals start from just £20 a month — insane value for London. Between the swimming, the gym, the classes, and the multipurpose hall, this place really has something for everyone.\n\nHighly recommend checking it out!",

Unfortunately, the showers does not have any temperature control so you need to keep pressing to get steaming hot water on you. For someone looking to shower before work after a workout, this is really not a pleasant experience as you come out sweating even more than when you come in (granted that I shower slightly cold). I brought it up to the staff and while they suggested that the disabled toilet got a temperature control that worked fine, I don't really feel that comfortable taking up their toilet for someone that has disabilities. Other than this issue the gym is decent enough, long open hours and not overly crowded as well as decently priced. I hope they sort out the shower issue and I will join again.",

Gym isn’t huge, but has good, versatile  equipment, is clean and has a good mix of users, with a good vibe. No standers & talkers. Used the Concept 2 rowers (great condition) and after a comment they got a network cable to allow them to be connected up for racing, so very responsive to feedback. Changing rooms clean. A good find and would recommend. To find it, if the gated alley down the side of Tesco’s is closed, go round the other side of Tesco’s , past the entrance to the Premier Inn, turn right and right again. Think the gym website should have decent map/directions as it is tucked away - but worth finding.",

There is a dedicated space for multiple disciplines of strength work (callisthenics, powerlifting, free weights, Hyrox) and the staff are stacked with personal trainers who can help you pursue your fitness goals in a way that best suits you. Andy and the team are very friendly and respectful, noticeably more so than your average gym, with it being apparent from your first session how passionate and dedicated they are to building a community of like-minded gym goers. Like most gyms, during peak hours it can be tricky to grab the machines you need, and sometimes the changing rooms can feel packed, but if you work/live around London Bridge, this is an ideal gym, and I would still be here if my office was closer (such that I could dodge peak times) or I lived closer. I was not much of a class-goer but they have lots of different options available for people to take advantage of.",

Regardless of what you're training specifically for (powerlifting, weightlifting, bodybuilding, strongman, CrossFit, hyrox etc.), there is high-spec equipment for every discipline.

The lobby has lots of seating and tables to work at, high-speed Wi-Fi and charging plug sockets throughout the gym. There's even a Café with snacks, coffee, protein shakes (and Rice Krispies treats :D).\n\nThe amenities are well-maintained and regularly cleaned - the changing rooms have individual showers, toilets and lockers (that can also be permanently hired for a small add-on fee). The women's changing rooms have recently been redone with new showers (and more improvements will be made soon).\n\nThe staff are genuinely so nice, make an effort to get to know you, and actually enjoy what they do. There is a huge powerlifting community here, and everyone is so friendly, willing to spot you, give you tips, or just generally up for a chat.\n\nIn my opinion, the membership cost is completely justifiable, and is so worth it. Every time I train I have an amazing session, rarely have to wait for the equipment or machines I want to use, and overall just really enjoy the atmosphere and the people too.",

I received an email saying I no longer had access, so I did not use the gym. Despite this, they kept pressuring me to pay for a full month’s membership that I never used.

But when I discovered this, I genuinely tried to explain the situation and find a solution. Instead of listening, they stood their ground and refused to understand.\n\nI find this unacceptable for a gym that claims to promote vitality and well-being. When everything is fine, there is no problem. But the moment you need a minimum of humanity and understanding, there is no one there. The customer service is very poorly managed and hides behind automated procedures.\n\nIf you are simply looking for a gym that takes your monthly payments without any real care, then you can go there.

The premises are very clean and welcoming ,as well as the changing rooms. I make great use of the pool also which is a very nice pool!

To raise awareness and safety for others.\n\nThere seems to be a regular group of men using the sauna either completely naked or semi-naked, with only small towels that often don’t adequately cover their private parts. Some individuals even stand up completely nude, leaving their towel on the bench, which raises both hygiene concerns and discomfort for others. On top of that, there have been provocative conversations and behaviors that don’t feel appropriate for a fitness environment.\n\nOnce, someone appeared to be using their phone in the sauna — possibly filming, though I can't be sure. These incidents, combined with the atmosphere created by this group, have made me and others feel uncomfortable and on edge.\n\nTo be clear: I fully support an inclusive, welcoming gym environment where everyone — regardless of gender, race, or sexuality — can work out and relax safely. But the sauna should not feel like a hookup space. As another reviewer rightly said, some of the behavior borders on predatory in the changing rooms.\n\nI strongly urge Gymbox to take clearer action. One simple but effective step could be enforcing a rule that men must wear swimwear or shorts in the sauna — just like in a mixed-gender facility. It’s not just about comfort, but basic hygiene and respect for everyone using the space.\n\nUntil something is done, I unfortunately won’t be using those facilities — which is a shame, because this gym has so much potential and otherwise delivers an exceptional experience.",

At peak times it's nearly impossible to get the equipment you need without having to wait and other gym users seem reluctant to share, too, which doesn't help the situation. There also still seems to be a huge push for new members which I understand from the company's perspective (££), but it really doesn't help improve the experience of current members who can't enjoy the gym. There aren't enough benches in the free weights area (they could really do with bolting some down so they can't be moved elsewhere) and there aren't enough dumbbells for how busy it is either.\n\nAs further example of how busy it is, they recently ran out of towels for members so I was unable to shower after my session. Furthermore, members are having to wait for lockers to become available before they can start a workout.\n\nSecondly, equipment is left all over the place. There have been several times lately where I've had to walk around the gym looking for the dumbbells/plates I need when they should have been on the rack. It's not a big deal, but it's frustrating in conjunction with my observation above. Putting the right weights back in the right spot is basic gym etiquette.\n\nThirdly, the changes to lighting in the men's sauna are horrible; it feels like sitting in a doctor's waiting room. Now, I understand why they've done it, but why punish the many for the actions of a few?\n\nFinally, they need to stop allowing wannabe influencers filming themselves in the gym and encouraging this by reposting them on social media.

Most gyms have a 'no filming' rule and I wish Gymbox would adopt this too!\n\nAs much as I like the gym; the vibe; the classes and the variety of equipment, my job is not flexible in terms of going at quieter times, so I'm seriously toying with the idea of finding another gym.

Having trained at various other gyms but never lasting longer than a few months, I have felt completely at home at TFR. I leave every session feeling motivated for the day ahead having had a brilliant session with the excellent training team. I take part in the shared PT sessions and sometimes it’s only myself and the PT! It is a great space to meet new people and get to know those who attend regularly. The professionalism and expertise of all the trainers is the best that I have experienced and I am lifting weights that I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near if I was training alone. I mostly train with Ryan and Lucy and they go above and beyond to make sure that I am doing the exercises correctly and improving my form, they’re both wonderful company as well. The fantastic facilities are up to date and are always clean. The showers and changing rooms are also great to use before cracking on with the rest of my day. I genuinely look forward to training here and I am pleased TFR is a big part of my life - would highly recommend!",

If you are looking for a swim school that can help to build your little one’s confidence with a big smile on their face and a thumbs up each week learning to swim unaided with style!!!! Then look no further than Angela’s Swim School! My Son learnt to swim with Angela’s Swim School and his style of swimming looks effortless (even had people approach me around the pool on our all inclusive holidays to remark on what a fantastic swimmer your son is for his age - 4years old) The pool at Darwin Court in Southwark is lovely, really clean and warm (great for the winter months!) the changing facilities are fully equipped and also very clean. There is a lovely seating area where you can watch your happy little ones swim each week and a very nice reasonable priced cafe area where you can purchase hot / cold food and drinks before or after your lesson. What can I say about the staff! fantastic, kind and caring swimming instructors that make such an effort with the Children each week (I don’t think I have ever sat around a pool and seen so many happy Children smiling each week) really lovely to see and to hear poolside I’m not the only parent buzzing about this swim school, they really do make an effort both with the swimmers and the parents. The swim school have an amazing swim programme (The Swim Stylers) the Children follow through the stages each term and are rewarded their badge and certificate at the end of each term poolside, my Son loved receiving his badges from his teacher. HUGE thank you to all the staff at Angela’s Swim School 👏",

If you are looking for a swim school that can help to build your little one’s confidence with a big smile on their face and a thumbs up each week learning to swim unaided with style!!!! Then look no further than Angela’s Swim School! My Son learnt to swim with Angela’s Swim School and his style of swimming looks effortless (even had people approach me around the pool on our all inclusive holidays to remark on what a fantastic swimmer your son is for his age - 4years old) The pool at Darwin Court in Southwark is lovely, really clean and warm (great for the winter months!) the changing facilities are fully equipped and also very clean. There is a lovely seating area where you can watch your happy little ones swim each week and a very nice reasonable priced cafe area where you can purchase hot / cold food and drinks before or after your lesson. What can I say about the staff! fantastic, kind and caring swimming instructors that make such an effort with the Children each week (I don’t think I have ever sat around a pool and seen so many happy Children smiling each week) really lovely to see and to hear poolside I’m not the only parent buzzing about this swim school, they really do make an effort both with the swimmers and the parents. The swim school have an amazing swim programme (The Swim Stylers) the Children follow through the stages each term and are rewarded their badge and certificate at the end of each term poolside, my Son loved receiving his badges from his teacher. HUGE thank you to all the staff at Angela’s Swim School 👏",

          "reviewText": "Let me begin by saying your staff here are fab! I have no complaints about the team - very friendly and helpful. You have been emailing me to review this place for months and I have avoided it for months to give you the chance to fix things so that I wouldn't have to leave a poor review but enough is enough!\n\nI frequent different branches of Snap Fitness because of my work, therefore this review is based on the conditions of other branches by the same company. I'm not sure what Elephant and Castle has done to deserve such slack servicing! The Hip Adduction machine has been \"out of service\" for over 3 months. The lockers near the toilets have broken off doors and when one isn't broken it is taken by a customer who doesn't believe in using padlocks, so you end up spending a good 5 mins opening and closing the lockers searching for an empty one. (I have seen the new sign saying \"no padlock no locker\" however it is not really enforced. Get a bucket and throw people's stuff in there for them to rummage through, seen as they want to behave without decorum.)\n\nThirdly, the sledge carpet area is dangerous! Near the end of it (closet to the water fountain), there is a section that caves inwards like a ditch. If you are doing walking lunges or using the sledge and you step on it, you can easily twist your ankle. If you are doing walking lunges with an heavy barbell on your shoulders, that injury will cost you as a company! Sort it out.\n\nFourthly, you are charging the same price as the branch in Raynes Park which now has a sauna! Yet the changing room in this branch smells absolutely rancid, the machines are tired, the plates are crumbling. I go to the Raynes Park branch and it baffles me how these gyms are provided by the same company yet are polar opposite in condition.\nOverall, great staff but an absolute poor establishment that needs renovation NOW!",

          "reviewText": "Let me begin by saying your staff here are fab! I have no complaints about the team - very friendly and helpful. You have been emailing me to review this place for months and I have avoided it for months to give you the chance to fix things so that I wouldn't have to leave a poor review but enough is enough!\n\nI frequent different branches of Snap Fitness because of my work, therefore this review is based on the conditions of other branches by the same company. I'm not sure what Elephant and Castle has done to deserve such slack servicing! The Hip Adduction machine has been \"out of service\" for over 3 months. The lockers near the toilets have broken off doors and when one isn't broken it is taken by a customer who doesn't believe in using padlocks, so you end up spending a good 5 mins opening and closing the lockers searching for an empty one. (I have seen the new sign saying \"no padlock no locker\" however it is not really enforced. Get a bucket and throw people's stuff in there for them to rummage through, seen as they want to behave without decorum.)\n\nThirdly, the sledge carpet area is dangerous! Near the end of it (closet to the water fountain), there is a section that caves inwards like a ditch. If you are doing walking lunges or using the sledge and you step on it, you can easily twist your ankle. If you are doing walking lunges with an heavy barbell on your shoulders, that injury will cost you as a company! Sort it out.\n\nFourthly, you are charging the same price as the branch in Raynes Park which now has a sauna! Yet the changing room in this branch smells absolutely rancid, the machines are tired, the plates are crumbling. I go to the Raynes Park branch and it baffles me how these gyms are provided by the same company yet are polar opposite in condition.\nOverall, great staff but an absolute poor establishment that needs renovation NOW!",

          "reviewText": "I purchased an introductory deep tissue massage session via Groupon, but unfortunately the experience did not reflect what was advertised. The appointment began with an extensive set of questions about specific injury implying that this is booking for the treatment for a specific area of pain/ injury. All of my medical details were gathered (not many... as I was not injured!!). While some screening is normal, this went far beyond what was necessary and felt disproportionate, especially as I had no injury and only mentioned general shoulder tension. Despite repeatedly clarifying this, the therapist continued to probe for very specific injury-related information that was simply irrelevant.\n\nAlthough the voucher described a full-body deep tissue massage, the session focused on only one area and felt more like a clinical assessment than an actual massage. The therapist frequently referenced his three years of experience in a way that felt dismissive rather than reassuring.\n\nThe environment also fell short of expectations. The London Bridge location appears to be inside a residential building, and the interior felt unwelcoming and hostile. The treatment rooms were extremely small and visibly worn, with marks and damage on walls and ceilings. Noise travelled clearly through the thin walls, making the session feel far from private.\n\nI was unexpectedly asked whether I had brought my own towel—something that was not communicated beforehand and is not standard in wellness or massage settings I had ever experienced (and I regularly attend physio and sports massages at various venues). They also could not offer water after the session, which is very unusual for a place offering physical therapy or massage services.\n\nMy appointment started late but ended exactly on time, with no adjustment despite the delay at their end. At the end of the session, I was 'strongly encouraged' to purchase additional treatments at a “discounted” price, but only if I committed immediately. The upsell felt pressured, particularly because the recommendations seemed based solely on the something I mentioned in passing. Payment was taken directly by the therapist- he had the card reader literally to hand in no time! There is no reception area, and I received no email confirmation of the payment or any kind of invoice—only the card machine receipt—which raises concerns about how transactions are handled and accounted for!\n\nThe following day I felt unwell (sick/ nauseous), which made me question whether the technique used was appropriate. I was warn that i might experience pain- but that's not the case- just feeling incredibly nauseous!\n\nOverall, the experience felt uncomfortable, unprofessional, and not aligned with what was promoted on Groupon. I would not return and would advise others to be aware of these points before booking.",

The location is absolutely perfect — close to public transport and easy to reach many of the city’s main attractions.\nThe rooms, showers, and toilets were all very clean and well-maintained, and the bedsheets were fresh and spotless. I felt very comfortable and safe throughout my stay.\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. Their warm attitude really added to the welcoming atmosphere of the hostel.\nI would definitely recommend Safestay to anyone looking for clean, safe, and affordable accommodation in London.

There was toilet paper stuck to the walls in the bathroom among other messes. I had to check out earlier than expected because their sandpaper like sheets where giving me a rash. And breakfast wasn’t included in my booking. Their privacy curtains only cover 3/4 of the bed so you won’t get any privacy but you will get some mood lighting from the fluorescent personal lights of everyone in the room at 1am.\n\nI think it’s worth noting that they give a free shot for positive reviews, so take those with a grain of salt.",

I really appreciate the rules too – they make sure everyone respects each other’s rest, and it’s wonderful to enjoy the sounds of birds instead of music when you want to connect with nature.\nThe composting loos are clean and perfectly fine, and there’s a washing-up area (looked like cold water only, though I didn’t use it). There are also two showers, which seemed nice and clean, but again I didn’t try them myself.\nOverall, this is a great green campsite – simple, calm, and with everything you need.

The security guard Steve was amazing and very understanding of our hidden disability.\nHe was a very nice man to talk to and you could have a right laugh with all the staff which made the holiday so much more enjoyable and fun. I certainly will be booking here a lot more often.\n\nEntertainment was amazing and they really put on a good show\nThe swimming pool was nice and warm with friendly lifeguards. Can’t wait for the new slides to be built.\n\nConsidering we booked bronze caravan wasn’t expecting much, but the accommodation was so clean and tidy and was more than I expected it even had a 40 inch TV and a dishwasher which we absolutely loved thank you haven\n😊😊😊",

The security guard Steve was amazing and very understanding of our hidden disability.\nHe was a very nice man to talk to and you could have a right laugh with all the staff which made the holiday so much more enjoyable and fun. I certainly will be booking here a lot more often.\n\nEntertainment was amazing and they really put on a good show\nThe swimming pool was nice and warm with friendly lifeguards. Can’t wait for the new slides to be built.\n\nConsidering we booked bronze caravan wasn’t expecting much, but the accommodation was so clean and tidy and was more than I expected it even had a 40 inch TV and a dishwasher which we absolutely loved thank you haven\n😊😊😊",

          "reviewText": "Booked 3 nights in a bronze caravan with our grandchildren here as a Christmas treat. On arrival we were upgraded to a silver caravan. Thankyou so much for that. The accommodation was great. Loved the Christmas tree, en suite main bedroom & 2 x twin rooms. Caravan was gleaming & well thought out with all the mod cons you expect nowadays. We had a minor issue with the TV which was resolved immediately. Great customer service. Park is in a lovely location overlooking the Thames estuary with Southend as a backdrop. It had loads to do which the kids loved. They did the bungee trampoline, swimming, the jump, aerial adventure & the climbing walls. Word of warning though. The pool is very very loud, busy & not one for doing lengths. It's a fun pool for families & children at the end of the day. Building work going on outside to modernise the outdoor pool apparently. We loved the park. It was relaxing & quiet where we stayed. I would highly recommend this park. We will come back again next year. Note: We did leave early Sunday lunchtime as we had booked ice skating in Gillingham & had work/school Monday morning. Local access roads to the site are not for the feint hearted but don't let that put you off.",

Everything in the glorified caravan is standard, not impressed attall. We only had 1 towel each provided, and only 1 single bed in each room was made up, so my children couldn't choose which one to sleep in, and I usually sleep with my youngest on the first night or 2 until she's settled so I had no sheet or pillow case or duvet cover. Welcome staff on gate were friendly but that's about it. Lifeguards all look fed up. Wetherspoons was lovely food and friendly staff. You pay a fortune for a \"lodge\" but in all honesty it's just a wider silver caravan. Same kettle, toaster,fridge,narrow beds etc. We have stayed in gold caravans with better specifications. Also you pay all that money and still end up with noisy old men as neighbours smoking in their caravan with the door open. Really not impressed. I think we are done with Haven. We had a 3 bed cottage in Cornwall for a week with a pool that was cheaper. What a waste of our money,  soo disappointing.",

Staff appear to make decisions as they please rather than following any clear policy. They justify this by calling it a “community pool,” as if that gives them the right to ignore discipline and basic standards.\n\nThere is no proper lane management. Swim coaches act as if they own the entire pool. It is common to see 7–8 adults crammed into one lane while lanes reserved for teaching have only two people casually chatting with a coach. This is unfair and poor utilisation of space.\n\nWhen I approached the manager to share this feedback, instead of listening, he became defensive right from the start. His first response was, “We’ve run this pool this way for 10 years. It’s a community pool. If you don’t like it, go elsewhere.” That attitude is unacceptable for someone in a customer-facing role. A colleague of his, clearly junior, was more professional and respectful. The manager, however, was dismissive and arrogant, behaving as if any criticism is a personal insult rather than an opportunity to improve.\n\nHis final remark, “Don’t come if you don’t like it,” says everything about his approach to customer service. If I had not already paid in advance, I would have left immediately.\n\nThis is not about one incident, but about a culture of poor management and lack of accountability. The pool desperately needs proper policies for lane discipline, fair allocation of space, and above all staff who listen and respect members rather than treat them with contempt",

I went to the changing room and told him I was there with my daughters. The man started pushing the other door changing room to see if they were empty, and when he saw that everything was occupied he ask me to help him. I told him to look for another one, since there were more changing room in other corridors and the man told me he wanted a changing room in this corridor and he asked me again to help him. I told him again that I couldn't help him because I was alone with my daughters. The man approached me and said that he thought I was going to help him, and I started to get nervous because I was feeling attacked and my daughters were going to get out of the shower and the man kept insisting that I had to help him!  He asked me many times to help him. I got so nervous that I said bad words and a man who passed by also started attacking me because I was saying bad words to the man and I got even worse and started arguing with that man and meanwhile the other man went into the changing room. The man kept saying things to me when he didn't know what was happening he just started attacking me because I was saying bad words. A young man from the staff appeared and was very helpful to me and I was able to calm down since those two men were attacking me and one of them didn't know what had happened before. The manager came and spoke to the man at the changing room, basically he told me that there wasn't much that could be done because he hadn't seen anything and he made me understand that since I had said bad words and that wasn't the way. So I had to cancel my daughters' classes (who were very happy with their teacher) because I don't want to see that man there and have another problem.

I live in the area and I travel to other gym.  All I asked was to end my contract after year, because of healthcare issues. It was not early ,it was exactly on time and I planed to come back latter in 2,3 month. After giving notice they continued to take money from me. It dosnt worth to lose custumers like that ,so that gym may be shadow money washing place. No one will act like that.",

My partner and I booked a day pass, we arrived a couple of hours beforehand to enjoy the sauna and steam room, which was amazing and then had a 60 minute massage.

The massage was great and customised to fit your needs - they made us feel very comfortable and communicated during the entire process. They were two young girls (I don’t have the best memory so don’t remember their names but one began with a V and I think the other was Donyel?).

We often sit in the cafe and wait to go in, and we haven't experienced this before.\n\nWhile i was in the loo, my partner was targeted by the dark haired lady (after the blonde lady was whispering to to her while looking at my partner), demanding him to order something, while holding a card machine. He explained he was waiting for me to come back and to go into the pool, but she asked him to leave if he wasnt ordering anything! There were multiple people (mostly women, and children, i may add) who were waiting like he was and they were not made to order anything.

Yhe blonde haired lady even came over to clean the table mext to me, so my presence was known. I was not demanded to order anything, nor leave. This proved that - for whatever reason - they did not want a lone, male patron in their cafe.

Even my kid feels totally demotivated to come and attend classes. I raised with their staff, they couldn't answer, they couldn't explain how they are teaching, how do the work kids strengths and weaknesses. I ended up cancelling the sessions.

There are also large groups of school-kids that work out all together and hog equipment. The refurb plan could have used the large area in the main room near the pull-up bars for more free weights, which would have helped the cramping.\n\nSecondly the hygiene of the changing rooms and showers is consistently an issue, with seemingly permanent mould / bad smells, and showers often being out of order. There was even a whole week where there was a leak and the entire gym was closed, and Puregym gave me no sign of when it would reopen, even though they said they would text. This led to me making a couple of 40 min round trips there for no reason, as I’d been led to believe it would be open - when I DM’ed one of the trainers to ask whether it was back open, as Puregym were of no help, he put on his insta story ‘do not message me about this’, which I found rather unhelpful considering I’m a paying customer.\n\nThirdly, there is a culture of domineering, macho behaviour and shouting in the free weights area which some of the staff turn a blind eye to. I’ve had a couple of really unpleasant interactions with people starting aggressive interactions around sharing equipment, which I’ve not had at all at other gyms. One of the staff also has a tendency to shout very loudly at their clients and give unsolicited comments on form to random customers, which I cannot block out even with noise-cancelling headphones, which doesn’t exactly make for the nicest gym experience.\n\nI appreciate that the staff are probably meaning well and we’re mostly all doing our best but I would suggest to go to another Puregym if you can, as most others are leagues above this one!",

It is at the bottom of Denmark Hill close to Kings College hospital and Denmark Hill train station and on the 42/68/468 bus route as well as other buses coming from Camberwell. I agree with other reviewers, very thoughtfully designed  and nice touches such as a big container of herbal tea, water and aromatherapy oils inside the wet sauna. There are metal cage lockers so bring a padlock to store valuables. Bring two small towels, one to sit on (a rule) and one to dry off / put over your shoulders as you walk in the outside spaces. There are three sauna huts, one dry sauna for silence, one dry sauna where you can talk, one of these is hotter than the other and a lower temperature wet sauna. They were all clean. There are a few private charging cubicles, one unisex and one each for male /female. The staff are very friendly and helpful. You don’t need to bring your phone as they find your name and time on the booking system. I took a piece of paper with receipt number in case. The sessions last one hour 30. Everyone there was relaxed, friendly and it felt like a welcoming space. I went with friend and we tried the wool-felt sauna caps - not seen those before! May get my own as apparently tradition in Scandinavia to keep head cooler, protect hair, reduce overheating and helping body to regulate temperature so less strain on cardiovascular system.Highly recommended giving this community sauna a go. Definitely feels like a community vibes place.",

Perhaps I was unlucky last time, as this time it was jut fine. I guess if there is a larger noisy party in the sauna it can be noisy, but there is a silent sauna on-site, so I think I over-reacted on my first visit.\n\nThere was also plenty of space this time ... Again I think I over-reacted last time!\n\nPlease do go to this amazing new community space.\n\n--\n\nA fabulous resource in a beautiful spot. Really well designed, with good facilities. 3 saunas, 2 plunge pools, showers, changing areas ... 90 min session is well worth it and left me really revitalized.\n\nNegatives: When sold out it can feel a bit crowded, though I have been to saunas in the past that were much more crowded, where people were pressed up against each other, and it isn't that bad. It is more that everyone is very shy about making any physical contact at all, making the space feel a bit limited.\n\nI think it could be a bit hotter.\n\nAnd I did experience people talking pretty loudly in the saunas, which does reduce the gentle power of the process. I don't know why, the noise level just rises, even though staff ask people to keep the noise down, it drops for a while when they do this, but then rises again. People don't seem to be capable of talking quietly to each other, but talk as though they were in a pub!",

A large fresco hung above the inside of the door featuring caricatures of famous men, all in a state of repose on various marble commodes. I paid my 5 pounds and found a stall at the end of the line that was named after Sir Issac Newton. Whether or not the great man had ever actually evacuated here was a moot point. As the string quartet played softly in the corner of my stall, the valet removed my britches and smiled knowingly. I was handed the Sunday Times and left in peace. After flushing (a burst of spring water with a hint of mint), I was directed to the gold plated sink to have my hands washed gently by a buxom maid dressed as Moll Flanders. I left with a spring in my step and feeling light and refreshed continued my tour of famous London toilets. Up next, Waterloo train station mens 3rd stall. Will it compare favourably?

I chose it because it seemed like a good option for getting to/from to the O2 Arena without having to go too close to the city, and also because it suited my super low budget.\n\nPros: It's quite literally right beside the train station (but far enough away that noise isn't an issue!).  It's also on a regular bus route that will take you directly to and from the O2 Arena.  The bar below the hostel has lovely food, a pretty decent selection of drinks, good music playing, and very friendly and helpful staff!\n\nCons: My main complaint is that the shower rooms were very dirty.  When I first checked in on the afternoon that I arrived, I had a look in the shared shower room and they very clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while.  There was litter and left over clothes and towels laying around, and all the floors looked quite dirty.  I showered very early the next morning and it was still just as dirty as the previous afternoon.  Also, not so much a \"Con\", but just a heads up... the floors and doors in the actual hostel/sleeping areas are quite old and squeaky (much more than the pictures would suggest), so earplugs are most definitely a necessity if you're a light sleeper.  Also, the air conditioning in the room consisted of a single small fan on the wall... which wasn't ideal in a full dorm as this summer was particularly hot all over Europe.\n\nOverall, an OK hostel for the price, and perfectly fine for 1 night on a budget... but dirty/neglected shower rooms are never a good sign.",

When I checked back in, even the different staff member that checked me in was surprised that I had to get a new card to get back in the same room where I was already.

I've asked if it was possible for her to come with me and let me quickly check if it was still there, something that would take only a minute, and she said I wasn't allowed to go back, and that she would contact housekeeping, and had to wait for their reply, but already dismissing me saying that house keeping probably threw it away already.  I've waited roughly 10 minutes, asked her if she gotten any reply, and she just said that they found nothing, and to me it just seem that she only said that just so I would finally go away. Because I had a train to catch, I left it there. I know it was just a towell, and was a minor inconvenience, but the lack of will to be helpful, and to do  the bare minimum was astonishing. I'm surprised that if someone forgets something in the room, the procedure is to immediately throw it away, rather than keep it in a lost and found. Unless of course, they dont really do that, and they have a lost and found, and she was simply just lying, because she couldn't be bothered.

Food is quite good but insufficient. I won't return.",

Beds themselves, I mean the buil was poor, matresses were OK.\nWhat's more, the hostel had a power outage that resulted in no wireless for the night and no light and electricity in the cafe area. Reception staff wasn't exactly sure when the power issue was to be fixed. In terms of location itself, it feels very residential, rather quieter that some hostels. Also,  in terms of getting to the city, you need to either get a bus or walk one mile to the station, so cummuting wise it takes an hour to get to the city and as there's no tube nearby, you need to waste a bus fare just to catch a train.",

The place is very dirty, I saw mice twice and I suspect the bedding isn’t properly washed or even changed from guest to guest. I booked a 4-bed room, thinking it would be better since there’s less people, but it was completely the opposite. There were bedbugs from eggs to mature ones all over the room, only myself and another guest were staying in there, so the receptionist was very nice to put us in a private room. The problem is that when we woke up the next day, the night receptionist mixed up our clothes in black bags, some stuff was missing and some other was in the hallway outside the laundry room, where anyone could access it. We doubted that he had washed everything at 60oC (which is the protocol to kill bedbugs), so we asked to wash our clothes again, but one more time the person in charge didn’t wash at the proper temperature and their tumble dryer wasn’t working, they were using a wash & dry machine, so our clothes were damp. We sent an email to the management asking if we could proper wash & dry our clothes in an external laundry service and if they could cover the costs, and they responded very defensive saying we were lying about the hostel having bedbugs, said that anyway bedbugs weren’t considered as a health issue since they don’t spread diseases and threaten to charge us a fine if we took pictures of the place and made public “false” complaints, they have a strange non-refund policy regardless the reason of request and also about taking photos/videos of the hostel. In resume, they know the problem they are facing, but instead of dealing with that professionally, they simply ignore it and are rude to people that express their dissatisfaction. It’s a shame because the hostel is well located, the staff is nice and the breakfast is great for the price, there would be a lot of potential if the management cared about their guests and business.",

After a small mishap with my dress, I couldn’t find a garment or sewing kit, and even basics like toothbrushes and toothpaste weren't provided — something I usually expect at a hotel of this level.\n\nAt both breakfast and the Skybar, we were given the bill before we’d even finished ordering or eating. It left us feeling rushed and slightly uncomfortable, especially during what was supposed to be a relaxed birthday weekend.\n\nThe shower leaked quite a bit, and we had to use multiple towels just to prevent the floor from becoming slippery.\n\nWe were also surprised to find that parking was £52 per night, seemingly regardless of how long the car is actually parked — something to be aware of if you’re driving.\n\nOverall, it felt like we mainly paid for the view and the location rather than the full 5-star experience. I truly hope these details improve, because the hotel has so much potential to offer a genuinely memorable stay.\n\nOh, forgot to mention the lovely housekeeper or room attendant who greeted us in the morning Nov 30 floor 14.",

Overheard another guest getting a refund at the restaurant whilst eating dinner. However, we found the food to be acceptable.",

          "reviewText": "Deceptive pricing on website, advertised £120 but came up to around £175 all in for one night plus £25 refundable deposit (double room).\n\nRoom was clean, but several essentials were either broken or inadequate:\n\n• One of the blackout blinds was improperly fitted, letting light into the room and disrupting our sleep.\n• The room was unseasonably hot for late October even with the thermostat on the lowest possible setting.\n• Flusher on the toilet was flimsy and got stuck when pressed.\n• Sink plug had to be removed by hand due to faulty mechanism.\n• Mattress kept sliding exposing hard corners of the bed frame, which bruised my shin.\n• Body wash in the shower was empty, not enough to use as it was not refilled before our stay.\n• Provided only a single 330ml can of water for a two person booking.\n\nFinally, breakfast was okay but no vegetarian protein option except for eggs. Overheard another guest getting a refund at the restaurant whilst eating dinner. However, we found the food to be acceptable.",
