All the pools felt bit cold which is not unusual for this area unfortunately my 9 month old was shivering in the baby pool which was the warmest one but once he started kicking around seemed okay. The changing rooms absolutely stink and that is the reason we won’t go back because I couldn’t stand it and the changing rooms were slimy on the floor and we struggled changing with no clean baby changer to use so had to hold him and get us all dry and dressed which took a lot time in that smell. On the plus the flumes were really fun though! There is a cafe but we didn’t use.",

Eyes down, throughout the whole interaction and there was no information at all about the facilities.\n\nI went in with my child to get dressed and realised I had no coins for the lockers so carrying all my things and my toddler I made my way back to do reception. To ask if they could change a five pound note. I waited patiently for the receptionist to finish her conversation with other staff and after a good minute she turned to me and said \"Yes?\" in a condescending tone.\n\nI asked her if she had chnage for a fiver and in the most smug voice through a sarcastic grid she replies that \"this is a cashless business and we'd have to just take our bags to pool side\".\n\nI said nothing and just went pool side with the little one as suggested with all of my things. There was no real place to put my items as every part of the floor poolside was wet. So I had to strategically place the items in an area far from my view that had to be dry.\n\nThe actual poll for the toddlers is more of a fun space and less about teaching your little ones to swim so I'd not recommend this pool if you had that in mind.\n\nThe session starts late and Finishes 15 minutes before the hour ends so be aware if you planned an hour. Not a big deal but I believe they may check the pool water for quality during this period.\n\nGetting dressed in the pool with toddlers is painless. They have a baby chnage mat as well as a upright chair for them to sit in while you get changed yourself. So no need to double team with a partner here.\n\nWeirdly as a CASHLESS business the lockers require cash as well as the hair driers. So I really think the receptionist was just mocking me.\n\nI'd highly recommend that reception take some time off to reflect on whether they want to remain at the business as they clearly don't enjoy their job. To management at this location consider putting your staff through hospitality training as it will go a long way to help the business grow. I know better Gym is still a council backed franchise but a minimum standard should be maintained.",

The gym is popular and has a lot of equipment. The music is the right volume and not annoying. Steven took great care to design a workout programme for me and it's excellent.\nThis facility hosts the local kayak club, who practice rolls in the pool during dedicated sessions. There are tunnel slides open sometimes by the pool and a little sauna at poolside. There are often swimming lessons in one lane.Tables next to the lobby provide a place to eat snacks. There are some fitness classes that seem popular.\nJust be sure to check the pool times so you don't turn up to swim when it's closed for cleaning.\nGood work everyone, making this a vibrant fitness centre for the community.",

Not your standard swim scheme like Swim England, but children from the age of 6 are swimming lengths?? Amazing! The facilities are incredibly outdated and poor so they lose a star there, but we come on a Saturday and the two younger ladies  and male teacher are great at their job.\n\nOnly downside is their carpark is a 5 min walk away from the pool, but it’s free and we make it work. We tried another swim school down Long Road and the teaching standard was so poor compared to the Leys.\n\nIf the Leys had updated facilities, it would be the dream place, however, the swim teacher standard is well worth the money",

I am hoping they are not actually part of CUH because they don’t follow the kind aspect of our ethos “Safe, Kind and Excellent” I have been going there for more than 2 years now and not once have I ever seen or heard reception staff welcome me. Maybe except one guy. You are not a 5 star hotel, you don’t have to smile and say welcome but at least don’t make me feel awkward by giving me a weird vibe. The swimming staff can also be rude but I’m ignoring that because health and safety sometimes needs a harsh saying. Every time I leave they don’t make me feel like wanting to come again. The people who actually go to the leisure centre are 10x kinder. Some people need to come to the leisure centre due to relax, unwind after a long days work. We don’t need extra mental stress. If I really didn’t want to go and relax to be healthier, I would have stopped going. Being inclusive is also very important as it’s hard to find people like that nowadays. They never say bye or welcoming the way other reception staff usually are. One time I thought they said “ciya” to me. When I said “bye” they laughed because they were not saying it to me, it was to one of their colleagues. I absolutely hate this mentality some people have. People need to learn to be nice. Pretend if you have to! I am not giving 1 star because they are at least informative. I guess they have to be. Thanks",

Some of the slow lane was reserved for swimming lessons but still left around 50m available. Can pay as you go or get a discounted rates if you're a member. Sauna can be added on for a few pounds extra. Water isn't heated but wasn't too chilly, 20° on a cloudy July day. Recommend flip-flops to walk between shower and changing rooms as stone ground has leaves and other bits of trees falling on it. Café on site with coffees and snacks. Reception provide a token for the lockers or some people leave their bag on a poolside bench.",

Great changing and shower facilities, toilets, friendly staff. A really good place to have some longer swim practice plus it’s shallow at both ends so no deep end issues that some people experience. The whole place is amazing. Clean and well looked after, just great. We travel 70 miles each way to visit it, it’s that good! In the winter it is cold but amazing, if you are a cold water swimmer  it’s the best!",

Parking nearby is limited and entails either a walk across the green or across a foot bridge over the river to get to the lido. The pool temperature was around 20° (displayed at the entrance) when we visited. There are a limited number of lockers on site, and you need to pay for a token (50p, non-refundable) at the entrance. Changing cubicles are rustic and there are limited showers/toilets, which were filthy and flooded when we were there. While the pool is a glorious and unusual swim (because of the length), and there were plenty of attendants and lifeguards, it's not especially clean - we swallowed a lot of debris while swimming (leaves, insects), and emerged from the pool to the (dirty, flooded) showers with leaves, insects and seeds in our swimwear. The pool is shallow at each end with a deep section in the middle. While this pool is definitely worth a visit for the experience of swimming super-long lengths, there are much better, and more uplifting lidos at Hitchin, Ware, or Peterborough.",

If you want a swim, year-round, this is the place to do it, taking account of the fact that it's not heated.  There's a sauna on site, so you can oscillate between pool and sauna to get a quasi-Scandi experience.  It can be bracing to get into the water, but when I have done even a short swim with one or two sauna warmups on a cool day, it's marvellous.\nIn summer, the lido can get crowded at the \"wrong\" time of day and in the school holidays, particularly if it's sunny.  Best avoided at such times if you'd like to do some reasonably serious swimming.",

While I understand the lockdowns have put a lot of pressure on businesses, this is a gym without windows.  The lack of AC has become a hazard and it encourages germs such as covid to thrive in this much heat.\n\nI’ve also had to stop using the massage chairs (the reason why I upgraded to ‘Plus’) because the warm water on top of the heat makes it unmanageable.  Staff have been telling members for months that the AC is going to be fixed \"very soon\", \"when we get a piece we're missing\", \"next week\". Enough is enough, this is 2021, it doesn't take this long to fix an aircon.\n\nI hope that this review helps Pure realise that this gym is no longer good value for money and they really need to step up.

The prices are also very reasonable compared to other gyms.\n\nI started my one-month membership today and was impressed right away. The gym is modern, spread over two floors, and has every type of fitness equipment you might need. The ventilation is great, and the locker rooms are clean, well-maintained, and feel very secure. In terms of location, it’s quite convenient — I walked there in about 15 minutes.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone staying in Cambridge, even for a short time, who wants to keep up with their fitness routine.",

I am very impressed by this gym, particularly the staff.\n\nThe gym is rarely over crowed and even when it's busy I have never struggled to get on what I need. The pool is great and I havent experienced it being too busy. The changing rooms and showers have always been clean and good quality. We pay for the champion membership which gives us guest passes and money off clothes etc, we have taken advantage of both.  The gym has a very welcoming feel to it.\n\nMy son (17) feels confident enough to go by himself now. The staff are always welcoming and helpful.\n\nAreas of improvement:\nThe sauna etc hasn't worked since I started, I am not too concerned as the monthly price is low for a gym with these facilities, but it would be nice to have.\n\nThere is one young male worker who unfortunately let's the team down. No issues when I am there but certainly doesn't treat my son with the same welcoming respect when he comes by himself, can be rude and unhelpful. Despite him being a quiet, polite gym user. Guessing he is assuming that a teenage boy might cause trouble, unfortunate stereotype which he should bare in mind when supporting all customers.",

For context I joined after a road traffic incident, 12 months doing rehab before getting the all clear and gaining the confidence to get myself active again.\nFirst things first, I needed a PT (not everyone will but one) who would work with my physio and clinicians to help me phase back into exercise (after planned and unplanned surgeries), weight and functional training and this is where Aidan, my PT, came in. From the off Aidan took my goals, assessed my capability and adapted to my current state and we got going! From chatting to the other PTs I saw they could accommodate for anyone’s goals amongst them (there’s like 20 to choose from based on your goals). The process was simple, exercise tailored to my schedule/pain tolerance with daily communication on my condition and a constant feedback loop. The workouts evolved constantly keeping me on my toes and ultimately helping me get stronger & more functional. Every step of my rehab journey Aidan adapted the training and I took extra classes included in the monthly membership such as the many yoga sessions and mindful meditation to help balance getting mind and body right. Ultimately everyone chooses a gym based on needs and the cost, and comparably no other local gym came close given the access to multiple studios, a swimming pool, cold plunge jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, lobbies, crèche, canteen, and a handy GP/Physio should you ever need it for a fraction more of the cost of other gyms in the vicinity. I’ve done the rounds with Nuffield gyms and outside of the City/Cannon Street and Barbican gym (which you pay a £10 fee for as a visitor, and a cost you don’t have to pay anywhere else) Cambridge seems to be the best facilities wide (but I’m happy to be proven wrong). Also like any gym a feeling of community is always a plus but I feel like comes natural (with the staff and everyone who works out on my schedule) another thing which makes this gym different to ones I’ve tried before.\n\nP.S. If you’re like me and forget your card often Grace, Jess and the staff are always pretty chill while sorting you out with a temporary pass.",

I’ve done the rounds with Nuffield gyms and outside of the City/Cannon Street and Barbican gym (which you pay a £10 fee for as a visitor, and a cost you don’t have to pay anywhere else) Cambridge seems to be the best facilities wide (but I’m happy to be proven wrong). Also like any gym a feeling of community is always a plus but I feel like comes natural (with the staff and everyone who works out on my schedule) another thing which makes this gym different to ones I’ve tried before.\n\nP.S. If you’re like me and forget your card often Grace, Jess and the staff are always pretty chill while sorting you out with a temporary pass.",

If small things like this are ignored, it makes you question how well the rest of the facility is maintained.\n\nOverall, very disappointing for a gym that promotes itself as 24/7.

          "reviewText": "Absolutely loved this gym, but after being a member for over two years there are a few things over the last year that definitely need improving. The air conditioning is not great. The gym gets extremely hot in the summer which isn't ideal at all. Broken equipment sometimes takes a long time to fix. There have been issues with soap and toilet paper running out in the changing rooms.  There are no cleaning stations on the gym floor so if equipment is left covered in sweat there is no way to clean it off. Not many rubbish bins around so people leave  rubbish on the treadmills rather than find a bin. The cleaner can be cleaning around you on the gym floor, but usually just hoovering (sometimes between your legs when you're mid set which is a bit odd!) Lots of weights not put away and can be left all over the place. Looking a bit tired in places and some equipment needs refreshing. The good points are nice members, the size of the gym, free parking and the overall amount of equipment available especially when it's all working. Overall I still love the gym but there are a few frustrations.\n\nI believe there is a manager now so hopefully things will improve again 🙏",

For the amount of men members that attend the gym, this is not enough! They should really think about getting more cubicles installed! 2nd issue with the mens changing rooms is that I think there is a drainage issue because sometimes it really smells like a used and abused toilet in there! 3rd issue with the mens changing rooms is that there are 5 showers and only 1 of them has a good water pressure! The other 4 have low water pressure! Another issue with the mens showers is that when you use furthest left or right shower, the sensors for the lights must not reach them as it goes dark quite quick and you can only get them to come back on by left the shower and the sensor picking up your movement! The showers could get a better clean too! There are also a lot of lockers which don't work!\n\nAnother issue is that most of the time, there is one or more bits of equipment broken and it takes a while until they're repaired! Considering that they have raised the money on quite a few occasions since it changed from Exercise for Less to JD GYM, they should really priorities getting equipment fixed quicker and to be honest, more equipment!\n\nAnother issue I find when it comes to the winter and the summer. They won't put any heating on over the winter and they rarely put the Aircon on over the summer.\n\nI think if the price ever reached £30 or more for a month, I would leave and find a new gym!",

Great atmosphere and music playing in the background\n\nNice clean washrooms and brand new looking showers for truckers with fresh smell to them.I would highly recommend Cambridge services very posh",

This is disgusting, not only is there one shower for women, but its so easily accessible for anyone. Shower floods and the sink and toilet were an absolute state. Shower doesnt last long so you have to keep pressing it. I'm not going to lie it is probably one of the better showers ive been too however it's still not great.

Haven’t been here for six months, but it’s certainly gone down hill a lot for truckers.Half of the truck park has now been taken up by charging stations, leaving parking for a max of 30 trucks which are crammed in tight by 7pm, this definitely means damage will be done more often in here as trucks try to park and leave in the morning. The showers were actually cold! Not even tepid. Apparently there’s a problem with the water heaters! The bins inside were full and apparently the ladies shower very dirty and smelly. Needless to say we didn’t have a shower. Most drivers aren’t slobs and have a lot of self respect and a company to represent! Not easy when all we have is abysmal facilities like this. We were still expected to pay £27 for the privilege of parking here! Maybe this is just one more reason the government can’t encourage more people into the haulage industry! Another parking area gone to pot!!!",

If you suffer from allergies, I strongly advise caution, as the dust under the bed appeared to be accumulated years.\n​Dirty Floors: The floor was visibly dirty and was clearly not hoovered during my entire stay.\n​Daily Service Failure: The room was supposed to be cleaned daily, but service was repeatedly missed. When I inquired at reception, the staff attempted to gaslight me, claiming the issue was my fault because I had pressed the \"Do Not Disturb\" button—which I absolutely did not. I had to call the front desk every single day to request basic room cleaning.\n​🍽️ Poor Customer Service at The Folio Bar\n​The staff at The Folio were consistently unfriendly and unprofessional, making customers feel like an inconvenienc. I ordered a quiche and politely asked for it to be warmed up. The staff member rudely asked, \"Don't you have a microwave in your room?\" He insisted I must have one, forcing me to repeatedly state that I did not. He finally complied, but his attitude was hostile.\n​ On another visit, the same staff member came in late and saw me waiting at the bar to be served. He finished serving the customer ahead of me and even engaged in casual conversation with me, saying, \"Oh, I remember you.\" After waiting for approximately 10 minutes while he tidied up, he finally approached me and simply announced, \"We are closed!\" He clearly saw me waiting the entire time, spoke to me, and yet only told me they were closed after making me wait, sending me away empty-handed.\n​Conclusion: This was, without a doubt, the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The combination of unacceptable cleanliness and hostile customer service made my stay extremely stressful.",

The shared bathroom looked clean at first but guests have to share a bath mat which got soaked by day 2. The hot water in the shower is heated by a small box heater attached to the shower head. The hot water ran out after I'd put shampoo on. Had to turn off the shower & stand in the cold for the heater to heat up more water before I was able to rinse off! There was no stopper in the room basin, resulting in my skincare bottle falling right inside the grain. I had misheard the check out time as 11am when it was actually 10am. George knocked on my door aggressively at 10:35am, inserting a door stopper as if he was about to clean the room when I was not even packed/dressed, declaring that he's an important person and I was making him late for a meeting. I finished packing in less than 10 minutes, yet he came back to order me to leave. This is by far the worst experience for any Airbnb or even guest house stay anywhere in the world. Airbnb removed my feedback only after half a day because I had unknowingly disclosed his job in the city, hence making him identifiable. This is why I'm reposting my review here because I do not wish anyone to make the same mistake.  AVOID AT ALL COST!!",

They also sent us a contract to sign less than three hours before we were supposed to check in that had a bunch of extra fees we'd never heard of.

Overall, the room was decent and fine for someone younger who just needs a place to stay.  However, management does not take care of the room and is horrible to deal with.",

Then it turn up they didn’t had ability for both days only one night. So we said ok that’s fine please cancelled the booking. They refused to cancelled and give us the money back. When we enter the room, there were not towels provided, no heating and the mattress soo old with the springs out and the toilet was dirty full of mold. At the end we decided to leave. We cancelled the booking but we never got any money back. Extremely bad customer service.",

The rooms were extremely low quality with broken and dangerous furniture. The shower was unclean and extremely poor quality. Almost everything was poor quality for the price. The walls are paper thin and I was kept up all night by a noisy neighbour. In general felt unsafe in the property and leaving valuables there. Do not stay here!!",

We were asked to pay everything upfront and so we did. A week before I called the company just to check if everything was ok, every person I talked with by phone seemed to not enjoy at all what they were doing (but was fine, it can happen). Once we arrived we have been asked to pay a deposit of 300£, fair enough. The young man who welcomed us explained what we had to know and showed us the rooms. At the beginning seemed to be everything ok but after looking around we start to see things that we were supposed to find in the room such as slippers and towels. Straightaway we told the young man what we were missing (as we didn't bring them from home because they were supposed to be provided by the company and we used the space in the luggage for something else) and he apologised and told us that we were right and he was going to bring them to us, never seen him anymore, fine they are just slippers and towels isn't? we started to put our stuff and clothes away and we realised that everything was very dirty, two fingers of dust in the wardrobe, on the ironing board and on shelfs. The room n3 didn't have warm water from day one (fortunately we had other rooms otherwise no warm shower in October). We called straightway the number found on the website and spoke with someone who told us that was going to call a technician and was going to let us know. Nobody called us back and no technician showed up. This story it lasted for the all duration of the holiday. We called everyday and always spoken to someone different who didn't know anything about our problem (which means there is no communication at all between the staff) and all of them could barely speak English. This when I experienced the worst customer service, all of them were rude, unpolite (talking like it was our fault) and unhelpful and every time we were told that they were going to let us now and guess what? nobody did it. The third day the toilet in the room n5 got blocked and we were unable to unblock it due to the lack of a sink plunger. We called again but obviously with no results. After booking 3 rooms in the same building, paying all the amount months in advance plus deposit we weren't expecting much but al least clean rooms and some warm water! I will make sure that any person that want to travel and are looking for a place where to stay won't book with Paymans.",

          "reviewText": "Please don’t even consider staying in this student accommodation. It’s consistently new problems on problems and I am really tolerant but I’ve had enough. When I first moved in the room hadn’t been cleaned or inspected from the last person who lived in it. I found multiple pairs of underwear and socks  left behind, hair in the shower and they even left their used toilet brush which had bowel remains on it🤢 That was not a big deal as I was cleaning the room regardless. The second issue was when the freezer stopped working and all my expensive meat went bad. I understand things like this can happen but my issue is I contacted the building maintenance and I never got a response which is really poor. My third issue with this accommodation is I haven’t got one full night of sleep since I’ve moved in. There’s always loud music, screaming etc from students outside on the street at night. You would be better off sleeping in a nightclub. However that isn’t the main problem. There is a false fire alarm at 2/3/4 am every other night. I thought it would stop after the new year but it still goes on and I assume it’s from people smoking indoors. My sleep schedule is completely messed up from the loud extremely frequent alarms. It’s unbelievable the amount of times it goes off during the night, its become so frequent that nobody will exit the building when there’s an alarm which can be very dangerous in the case there is a real alarm. Now what really pushed me over my limit and made me write this review was an incident today. I was asleep in bed and unwell this morning and a lady who works in the building unlocks my door with no prior warning and tells me to put my shoes on and to follow her. I did so as I thought it was an urgent situation in the flat. I follow her to see she was moving in a new tenant with his mum into the flat and she was disappointed in the tidiness of the kitchen. I can definitely understand that as I am a very clean person and I always tidy after myself but I have been away for Christmas break. Therefore, I cannot control the mess of anybody else. With that said, I find it completely unacceptable to be brought in by myself into the kitchen and being told off and to clean as if I am in primary school. An email beforehand would have been good before I had someone unlock my room. I am not the only person who lives there I just happened to be the only one in my room and the place can get a mess quickly with so many other people using such a small space. I don’t think it has to be said but I am not the only one responsible and I always clean and this was not necessary for a ‘first warning’. I feel extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed about this situation especially being made to come out of my room half asleep and being singled out and told off in front of other people. I don’t deserve to be treated like that, especially over something like a quick take out of the bins or hoover which I do anyway but as said I had been away. Her attitude to me truly caused me emotional distress. The accommodation hasn’t had any water for 2 days due to maintenance and given the state of the place from before I moved in such as silverfish infestations, my broken wardrobe door, lifting floorboards etc I wouldn’t say it’s the shard hotel for this to be justified although with the London rent prices this accommodation charges they seem to think so. A nice dramatic email with a bunch of threats before this instead of after would have avoided the incident completely!\n\nStaying here has made me think maybe a 3 hour commute to uni isn’t as bad as I thought. Please consider ANYWHERE else to live. This place is a last resort, and not a good one. The staff and the quality of the accommodation for the price are very poor.  The only positive would be the location as it’s near to the train station and corner shops but there are plenty of other accommodation options very near anyway.",

If you're looking for river view go for the other rooms but you may have slightly more noise from the nearby railway from those.  Staff a little grumpy but generally OK. Breakfast was OK. My main gripe is the extremely misleading rating is has managed to attain on Booking.com.  This is not a five star hotel. Do not be expecting. Restaurants, swimming pools, room service, concierge, valet parking etc. that normally constitute 5 star hotels. Not that any of these are mentioned in the listing. This is an excellent 3 star guest house. It is one of (if not the) most expensive in Ely - possibly because of the rating. It is therefore somewhat over priced for what you get. Still,  a very clean, warm comfortable if cosy overnight stay.",

Great location for the cathedral and shops and restaurants, situated right on the river\n\nThe reason I've marked it down for service is that there was a bit of an altercation with the lady who was probably the manager.  It was all done via the ring doorbell and whilst my husband wasn't aware there was a pin code for the door as I hadn't told him, he got out of the car to ask about parking as there were no spaces available outside and it wasn't really clear where we could park.  Had the lady just advised us that there was free parking in Ship Lane, a 2 minute drive away, then we wouldn't have got into the argument with her as she insisted on reading out details of the messages she had sent me prior to arrival but I was already aware of these details, I just wanted to know where the alternative parking was.  So instead of talking to me through the door bell and telling me to go into the hallway and look at the map to see where alternative parking was available, she could have explained it clearly and saved us all an argument and then she wouldn't have had to message me to tell me we had spoken to her using strong and inappropriate language towards her ( which we didn't, we were speaking among ourselves but she was still listening via the doorbell) and telling us to make sure we didn't speak to the breakfast staff in such a manner or she would be forced to stop serving us.\n\nSo - apart from that, we had a pleasant stay, it's a lovely hotel but beware of upsetting Lily!!",

There were steep inclines down to the pitches however the pitches were level so no levelling blocks needed. All the usual good Caravan and Motorhome facilities, with excellent less abled facilities too.   The wardens were very friendly and helpful.\nThe motorhome emptying point and fresh water were accessible but it was a little narrow and restricted and turning round was a bit if a shuffle, we don't have a particularly large motorhome , under 7m in length. We requested a pitch near the less able facilities and we were allocated pitch 7 which meant having to navigate a steep incline with a gate to get to the toilet and showers.  I was not able to use my wheelchair and had to be helped to the showers by my husband who had to wait for me so he could walk me back.  We realise that the allocations of pitches for less abled has become more and more difficult since the introduction of the tick box on the booking form and in future we will phone ahead and request a less able pitch so we can avoid the above situation.  I would like to point out that this situation is beyond the control of the wardens at Cherry Hinton and does not reflect on the excellent service we received from them.",

The pub is about mile to walk food limited and comes in boxes however, very nice. Busses to take you to Cambridge are about 3/4 mile walk. Takes you straight into Cambridge. Very easy. Go on the Whippet app. You can even see where they are on route. Will definitely come back.",

A useful cabin was also provided for washing pots and pans storing cold items and generally hiding if the weather outside is unkind. My partner loved camping in the orchard and being allowed to help herself to the apples, I think she left a few!

The pitches in several different areas making it less of a big field setup. Fishing is the big thing and there are several areas to choose from all set in lovely countryside. The pitch we had was on Astra turf and fully serviced. I don't really like this surface but as a practical choice it works really well and we didn't have the usual mud patch outside the door. The electric is metered and you get an allowance for this and then pay for anything over this you use, which seems very fair. There is a cafe and bar onsite by one of the lakes. The reception staff were great and very welcoming and the shop well equipped. The only slight niggle was the showers. Although there was no 'button' to press and hold, they were electric and the water flow on any setting was poor. They were also perhaps not up to the standard of others we have seen at other sites. Having said that this really is being picky as it didn't spoil our stay, but with everything else being so good it seems worth providing feedback on this. A great place and for us as a fairly local site we will definitely go back.",

Decided to do a trial day to get a feel before committing to a membership and I’m glad I did. Communal showers that burn you and hardly any of them worked. And most are around the pool area, so no chance of showering properly after swimming unless you want everyone staring at you. Changing rooms were so dirty on the floors, used nappies shoved under benches and hair ALL over the floors in the changing room cubicles. They also split the main pool into 3. One third was being used for lifeguard training it would seem. 2 lanes for swimmers and then 1/3 of the pool left for everyone to try and squeeze into. I appreciate it’s the summer holidays and you try to accommodate everyone; however you could barely swim 3 metres infront of you without bumping into someone or getting splashed in the face consistently, the fact you can allow 80 people in there at one occasion with only 1/3 of the pool open for full use is insane and not safe. Maybe do your lifeguard training during a time where it’s not open for all members of the public? Didn’t even stay the whole hour, left within half an hour as far too busy and noticed multiple people did too. Clear signs to indicated no arm bands or floaties past a certain point but ignored by multiple people and lifeguards did nothing about it, so those at the deep end who are trying to swim safely can’t as they’re getting splashed in the face by kids or they’re all lined up round the deep end of the pool.\nNeeds seriously updating and managed correctly for safety. (This also includes lack of swimming availablity for primarily adults through each and everyday on the schedule too.) really disappointed as the membership fee is very reasonable, but can see that’s because they want everyone in there all the time. Hot tub was closed and steam and sauna rooms are very small, can barely fit 2 people at a time.\nNot sure what the gym is like or other areas as I didn’t explore those options due to wanting to join primarily for swimming.",

Having a well-sized private pool to ourselves was such a treat, we put on our favourite playlist and fully relaxed. Loved the fun beach hut style changing rooms and decor.\n\nLooking forward to coming back soon!",

Was very pleased with the amount of changing facilities, very happy to see they had a baby changing station which come in handy with our 2 year old. The pool was the perfect temperature and the whole place was very clean and tidy. And would be nice to take my parents who dont like swimming but do enjoy seeing their grandchildren having fun, as saw their was seating for non swimmers. We'll definitely return in the future. The flooring wasn't an issue for us and our children had no trouble jumping in.",

I unfortunately don’t have a regular slot (due to own circumstances) but love coming here every now and again with the family. It’s really easy to get a one off slot if you follow their Facebook posts. Always message back promptly! 🙂 would highly recommend!",

Usually the member of staff would roll a towel in front of you place it under the desk and hand you one from the plastic bag!\nThe not so clean changing rooms feel like a sauna, the aircon is non existent, showers dirty and moldy , buckets laying around because the ac is leaking for months, toilets dirty and bins full… what a delight. May I add, having a hot shower is a gamble too.\nThen we go to the gym, the famous gym, where 30% of the machines are not working for months. However you should feel grateful if they are being fixed after 3-4 months and are not just being taken away, never replaced and the space where once was a machine becomes empty and sad. Cable clips are like unicorns … can never find one, also cable machines are out of order as they failed the H&S, the rowing machines must be also broken for a year now. Don’t expect to see staff on the shopfloor checking if machines are working or if is clean, that would be way above their pay grade. Gym in general is small and basic.\nNext stop, the luxurious spa! Don’t remember when it was the last time every facility in there worked, always something out of order. Steam room is not working for over a year now, is just a warm room, unless you put some water over the sensor then it becomes a torture room where the steam is so hot that it burns your skin, I guess some people are into stuff like this (each to their own). The hydro pool, again if you are into hurting yourself then that’s the best place, the numerous broken and missing tiles would do the trick!  The sauna is the only pretty decent thing minus the blood stains on the ceiling, not sure what’s the story there. Luckily I’ve been watching Dexter and I can identify blood splatters!\nOutside pool and jacuzzi barely open , clean and available. More sun beds have been bought recently however on sunny days they have been kept away because is funny seeing members sitting on the concrete floor. Lifeguards are such a delight to look at, you can really see the excitement in their eyes for being there. You also get counted like sheep, no problem there, however most times the numbers are wrong as nobody bothers to take it seriously.\nHave I told you the spa was closed for 4-5 months to build a wall plus extra little bits ?!? I was convinced they were building the wall of china, but how wrong was I ! They also had the brilliant idea of removing the water fountain, is not like you need any water, water is so overrated! They also left us just with one shower, we all queue up like in the Covid days.\nAnyway, the area is always dirty and staff walk right past litter and broken tiles without even looking at them. Once a light post fell and 5 different lifeguards passed it, looked at it and continued doing their thing, great initiative!\nThere was a flem all dried up right next to the hydro pool for a month without exaggeration, reported it on the day it happened, no actions until it became so dry that the water jets must have took it away. Also shows how often the pool area is being cleaned, yakes!\nAnd you end your lovely visit by saying thank you on your way out and being ignored by the staff members as they are either not interested or too busy gossiping with their colleagues.\nThe manager is like a scaredy cat, nowhere to be seen. No matter how many feeeback forms you fill and request a call back you shall NEVER be contacted, even if you ask at the desk for the manager that would also be a big ask and will be told he will call you shortly, don’t hold your breath!\nCustomer services, again no hope! Not interested in what you have to say and will advise you to cancel your contract! See I would, if that wasn’t the only gym next to home and work! However new big boy gym is in town, let’s see how many people will stay!",

It’s a shame because staff are lovely who work on site, it’s the decision makers and external teams that are lacking, which in turn impacts the club and its members. But as long as the money keeps rolling in, who cares right?\n\nIn conclusion, if you like paying for more than what you get, dirty showering facilities and awful customer service (directed at the membership team) - this place is for you.

I tried to book the same slot but kept running into errors as I have already got in my cart which doesn't exist. I have tried everyway to try and find the cart but none at all. finding the cart should not be this hard to find, it should take a second to see where your purchase is. Me and my partner are now having to look around for other private swimming pool to become a routinely visit just because how the cart option either not existing or being extremely hard to find. Like I said cant fault the venue it looks really nice but the fact that the cart option doesn't exist or is really hard to try and navigate has now made us go elsewhere. Is a shame as the venue looks really nice.",

We booked in advance on the website for an early morning lane swim as this is a popular pool and sessions can reach capacity. The pool is fairly wide (about 16m), with 4 lanes (slow/ medium-slow/ medium-fast/ fast) which work really well as there is plenty of room to swim breaststroke and even overtake within each lane. There is also a smaller pool for younger kids. The main pool has a small water slide, plus a low diving board, which are open during the casual swim sessions. Staff are friendly + 2 attentive lifeguards at either side of the pool. There is limited free parking at the pool, but there is an additional free car park along the road. There are traditional changing cubicles, which are clean, warm outdoor showers, and a relatively new toilet block. Lockers are available (£1 refundable), and there's a small tuck shop on site. Definitely a pool worth visiting 🤗",

There are very few parking spaces and you have to pay but that is understandable! 1 star is too much for such a location..",

Great choice of “cold shockers” to get your immune system buzzing: cold shower which runs drinking water so bottles can be refilled from the tap as well, cold  bath and a natural pool for the brave ones:-)\nThere’s an old bus serving as a chill out and changing area. The outside lights come on when it gets dark so it all looks great too as well as you feel you are not that far from civilisation:-)\nThere is a choice of a few different essential oils to throw on the hot stones which makes it a whole different experience and a nice touch as a little battery powered light ball so it’s not completely dark in the sauna itself as there’s no light inside.\nThere’s enough wood provided to keep it hot at around 100C*. We’ve spent two hours getting hot and the plunging into the cold bath so the only thumbs you have to worry about is being careful and using the heat glove provided for obvious reasons. Hope all the above helps those who are not sure about this place or experience. Oh, nearly forgot, there is a compostable toilet right next to the sauna so need to worry about flushing or blockages😉☺️\nWould go there tomorrow again had they had availability so I guess it will be in the new year😏☺️",

You can connect to the sauna to listen to your own music, there is a shower in the private sauna room for you to wash off after, with shampoo, body wash and conditioner. Soft towels! Hair driers are available, however we did not use them as it was a very hot day when we attended. We will be there again soon for floats! I will then update my review!\nReturned for our floats! What a GREAT experience, I can't wait to float again!! I found the experience very relaxing. I floated with the lid closed for a while then with it open and lights out. Before you get in the tank, there is a cup of water, goggles, vaseline for any little cuts you may have to stop them stinging when you get in, there is a spray bottle of water and a flannel in the tank with you incase you get salt in your eyes (very helpful), just don't drop your flannel or leave it in the water as it can block the filtration system. The music wasn't the best (rain forest tune). The tanks are big, plenty of room, with a shower in your room for after, to get rid of all the salts. Soap, shampoo and conditioner is supplied, they smell lush!\nI used the massage chair before my float, this was not too bad, not for me though, was rough on my left leg (I was warned about this beforehand as others have said it's a bit too much on your legs), the chair massages your back, arms, legs and feet. It wasn't bad, just wasn't for me.\nI highly recommend Float in Norwich! A very welcoming, relaxing and informative environment. I will be returning!",

Excellent customer service and friendly staff.\n\nNo joining fee. Cheapest in Norwich. App UI/UX could be better, but not important.\n\nDefinitely recommend and will go again.

There is plenty of parking but have to park further away during busy periods.\n\nInside, the design is great and there is a wide range of equipment. The equipment itself is mostly made up of the current Life Fitness and Hammer Strength, most of this is very good, and is far better than the offerings in rival commercial gyms.\n\nThere is a sauna in each changing room and this is a great addition considering the low monthly cost of just £20.99 a month. The changing rooms themselves are quite small for the size of the gym and don't feel the most sanitary, they are also very hot due to the sauna.\n\nUnfortunately, a low monthly fee and offerings such as the sauna mean this place is extremely busy, even during weekday evenings past 10pm and weekends. There are far too many members even for the size of the gym, at peak times, it is near impossible to get a good workout in. There are duplicates of some machines, but this is still not enough. The gym either needs to pause new members joining or add more equipment, there is so much more empty space they could utilise. They need two more smith machines, extra lat pulldowns and duplicates of popular equipment such as the Pec Fly and Incline Hammer Strength Press, and a couple more cable stacks. This would greatly improve the experience of using the gym.\n\nDespite the above, they have made a few improvements from December 2023 to now, which includes slightly improved cleanliness of the changing rooms, and additional weight trees, but more needs to be done.\n\nOverall, this gym is definetely worth it if you plan to go at like 10/11pm or during the day or weekend, but I would look elsewhere if you like going after work at 6pm.",

Lots of equipment split into many different areas. Please see details of equipment below.\n\nBrand: Matrix, Primal, Origin and Bootybuilder\n\nFree weights up to 50kg, many duplicates for busy times. 2 Smith machines, 6 cable Pulldowns in addition to some machine Pulldowns, 4 Seated rows, 8 dual cable stacks, plate loaded upper and lower body equipment, hack squat, pendulum squat and other squat machines. 2 Smith machines, 4 flat benches, multiple incline and decline benches. Large Hyrox/crossfit area, dedicated glute training area, duplicates of pin loaded matrix machines, some less-common Primal plate loaded kit which felt really good, I loved the Bicep Curl and Smith row. Lost count of the number of squat racks! Large cardio area but doesn't take up 80% of the whole gym some like commercial gyms. Also, lots of great attachments including genuine MAG grips for Pulldowns and even fat grips (very rare for a commercial gym to have these!).\n\nOnly issue I encountered was I had to hunt for 20kg plates, there's enough but they were scattered everywhere, but this is usual for a commercial gym.\n\nChanging rooms and toilets good, bring your own padlock for the lockers. Showers looked clean. Free water available, vending machines, seating area etc. Good lighting throughout the gym and the gym was a comfortable temperature.\n\nMusic terrible like 90% of gyms, but I'm a headphone user so not a problem for me!\n\nOverall a fantastic place to workout, tons of equipment and lots of duplicates for busy periods. Great value, highly reccomended. Better than other Gym Group and Pure Gyms that I have visited. Pleasantly surprised as I'm not the biggest fan of commercial gyms.",

We paid £90 for 2 of us, which included 20 min back massages, 2 little bottles of procceso and unlimited use of spa facilities, like sauna, jacuzzi and swimming pool. Changing rooms and showers were in good condition. Swimming pool area more busy, no seperate pool for children so adults are together in one, there's a seperate line across pool, made for better swimmers, if I understand correctly. Only 2 saunas, very busy, hard to get a spot in ordinary sauna, steam one was less used. Also not rules of using towels or providing seat pads in saunas so you don't sit on other people's sweaty spots. Also no limitation of how many people are allowed to go in at once.\nCafe area is spacious, food is very cheap, but simple, ran out of eggs and avocados, which was around 12pm, but gave us discount on other food. Overall a nice place, definitely recommend",

As as others have said, the experience of walking past the cafe in your towel or gown to get to the spa was uncomfortable.

There is a lot of equipment for HIIT, cardio machines and a small weights area.\n\nI had two flaws: 1) There's no cleaning spray and cloth to wipe down machines or benches, so I recommend bringing your own towel; 2) There are only 2 squat racks (one of which where you can deadlift), 1 barbell bench press, 1 smith machine. At busy times it is likely extremely difficult to use these items without waiting. On each of my sessions I was attending ~6am so it was fairly quiet. There are 3 (or 4 can't recall) cable trainers and a dip station. I was nicely surprised that there were some bands for stretching.\n\nIn terms of access and purchasing a 5-day pass, it was all very smooth. I was given a code to open doors and had no trouble.\n\nSummary: Solid gym, good for holidays/trips to Norwich, probably a bit small for a regular gym, unless you're attending very early in the morning.",

I want to be safe and go home to my family at the end of the week with my full wage and not having to wait anywhere between 1 week and 6 weeks for those expenses to be paid back. SNAP have created a service that looks after every part of parking that we hold important. They consult truck stops on security and how to keep our loads and us safe when we are sleeping. They facilitate a payment method that doesn't leave me out of pocket and awaiting expenses to be paid back and they act as a champion for HGV drivers, taking the feedback we give them and bringing it to the attention of the truck stop owners.\nTheir social media presence is also something to check out. SNAP are always engaging with drivers from all sectors, giving shout outs and praise to those who would otherwise be overlooked.\nMy experience with SNAP has been nothing but positive.",

Yes it's get full fast, yes it's on a slope  in some places..... but.... food is absolutely winner 10/10\n\nTop price (as you have a few options) is £35 with £12 food voucher. Other options  are for £6/£31  and so on. £ 12  feed you everything  from menu apart from fully monty grill  £15.95\nFood menu is massive,including  burgers,curry,kebabs,home made pizza sandwiches  and so on. Food is awesome!  Trucker next to me said they try to kill you with the size of those portions. I saw different  platters out and all was great and when ask all said amazing. So a big shout out to a kitchen staff!\n\nAll place  very clean and tidy, don't forget to take token for a shower(7min plenty enough)  shower  room with massive space and regulated temperature of water 😎💦😍 so in summer - winner.\n\nStaff mostly  very friendly  and kind, one bad egg but it might  be not his day so I won't  blame or judge  his life  on that. We all had it.\n\nIf by any  chance  I will be around, even  for a sneaky 45 I will be there!\n\nI would recommend it 100%",

After we parked, I was BLOCKED by a running frigo and I couldn’t move forward or backward. It was my favorite parking and I used to park here all the time since 2016, now I avoid it. The mushrooms chicken was not cooked enough, I didn’t send it back because it was impossible to do anything about it after that and I didn’t want to find some ‘spices’ added. They couldn’t provide me the bank card receipt which I needed. And the showers are good, but they should have start/stop buton, especially for women, 7-8 minutes it is not enough, or at least it should play the sound one minute before ending, not when the water stops so we are able to rinse.",

I was woken at 3 am by a lorry trying to vacate the yard, it took him 15 minutes to get out, there simply isn’t enough room to drive forward enough to clear your tail swing, it’s a complete disaster of a place for this reason",

There are no other snap parkings around , and I'm grateful for that, because at least I could spend my afternoon  on the nearby Felixstowe beach ,which is five minutes walk away . All the Seaside attractions included.\n\nWhen getting there, don't Mind the restriction - it's except for access , and you do need to access a lorry park.\n\nWhen parking, and your artic is longer than ususal, be careful not to hit the wall in the back. Some spaces are too short for longer artists and the wall is nice, new, and litten up. See pictures.\n\nThe showers are paid extra £3.\n\nThere is a shop and a café. The place is simple, quite small but sufficient, modern , and has everything you might need for your stay in the area.\n\nI hope I'll visit again soon and wish you best of luck for years to come.",

Tarmac is good and smooth and the traffic humps are normal. The most used part of the services are always the toilets and these are placed through the front entrance and down to ,the right. There is a Game Zone on the corner. Due to it being just below ground level the are both a few steps and a ramp for the less mobile of us.

Coming out of the “Loo’s “ there is a Waitrose and then WH Smith’s on your right and then round to the left you have Subway and then Burger King. To finish the food and drink there is a Starbucks as you come in the Services entrance who have a sit in and an outside seating area for when it’s nice weather. Outside there is a washing machine pod where you can wash upto 20kg  (or so the sign says).\nThere are 24 Tesla superchargers then 4 Grid serve chargers by the walkway to the entrance and all round the outside left of the car park (with your back to the entrance) there are 24 charging points, but I’m not sure of the company who operates them,",

The social worker didn’t take it seriously enough in my eyes and the carers were a waste of time as they literally did NOTHING other then get her up, make her tea, give her meds. Grandmother is delusional she says she is independent but in reality is not.\nShe has all the typical signs and behaviours of Vascular Dementia and they seemed oblivious to it scoring 0 on her care needs form.\nA male carer came in which I thought was off, grandmother has dementia and carers were assigned to wash and dress her and having a male do that with a woman with Dementia isn’t right in itself, i personally don’t think so. Yes in hospital male nurses is different but you catch my drift.\nShe gets very disoriented most of the time especially when waking up any time of day, suffers hallucinations, paranoia and delusions. Lies, is always agitated or anxious, does other strange things which is very dementia related. I have researched a lot and obviously more knowledgeable then adult social services which is a joke in itself.\nNot taking struggling family into consideration at all, offering no support for us to help with the situation we are in.\nAnd funny fact we have security and nanny cameras to prove this.\nAbsolutely disgraceful.",

From the first conversation and throughout our stay no issue was too small for Liam to help us with. Everything was perfect- and there were so many lovely homely touches. The kitchen is awesome & such an inviting space to be in (I miss the fridge & dishwasher!). The giant bed upstairs was just the best and all the rooms are cosy. The whole property is so well presented and the location being so central was nice and will be even better now the town is open. Loved the open deck too - nice to watch the world go by from. Will definitely book through ginger and gold again!",

They were very patient as we packed and loaded the car which i massively appreciated.\nWe took 3 dogs and there was a simple wooded walk alongside the golf course, leading on the site as well as a few locally.\nAs we were in the bottom field with the composting toilets I mainly used them. No matter what time I used them they were spotless, smelled nice and had everything you would need, the best composting toilets I've used. The showers and flushing toilets were also clean and well equipped. Im very fussy about things being clean and i was really happy.\nThere's a bar inside the bowling club and they can cook meals if you check ahead.\nLidl is fairly close for getting pastries for breakfast. They have a fridge, freezer, prepping area and sink so easy to cook and store food.\nThe closest and very pretty beach at overstand was about a 30/40 minutes drive with good parking.\nA big thank you to Maxine and Ethan for their friendly and welcoming arrival and departure.\n\nDisliked\nThe grass cutting on the golf club was a bit noisy.\nBuilders are working close by and started early.

The facilities were faultless,I would say better than some hotels I've stayed at and what a refreshing change it was not to have to keep pressing a button in the shower. Our pitch was one of the furthest from the facilities block so the wifi was a bit sketchy,especially when everybody was using it and it was constantly dropping out so next time I'll request a pitch closer to the block.Will definately be back next year,we've already scouted out a couple of pitches we'd like.",

The pitch sizes were generous, giving us plenty of space to relax and enjoy without feeling crowded.\n\nOne of the real highlights was the water equipment on site – perfect for the kids (and adults!) to have a bit of fun and cool off.

He was friendly, welcoming, and always around to help with anything we needed – it’s clear he takes real pride in the place.\n\nIf you’re looking for a well-equipped, family-friendly campsite with everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay, look no further.

I just wanted to clear a few things up and give a fair review.\n\nThere are two toilets and a shower, all with hot water. While the sinks for washing dishes don’t have hot water, we simply filled a pan from the hot tap in the toilet sink (just a couple of metres away) and used that—hardly an inconvenience, especially when camping.\n\nThe campsite itself is in a beautiful riverside location, with canoes and paddle boards available so you can really make the most of the setting. We paddle-boarded to the pub about an hour upstream and to an old mill about an hour downstream—both trips I’d definitely recommend.\n\nThe campsite owner is a lovely chap who really can’t do enough for you. He even set up a campfire for us and kindly let us borrow the BBQ on several occasions, which made our stay even more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic spot if you enjoy a relaxed camping experience in a beautiful setting with a genuinely welcoming host.",

There is a bath time area with buckets which you can fill with water and use at your pitch... This was a godsend considering the heatwave we were camping in! The firepit/grills provided we used non stop for cooking and keeping warm in the evenings. I love an honesty shop! It was so cute and the logs and kindling were really reasonable!\nIt's a big open field which is perfect for kids and out toddler had such a blast.\nWith only a 15min walk to 2 different pubs you can't really go wrong!\nWe will certainly be back again :-)",

But it is a nice neighbourhood with good restaurants. Quite a bit of Norwich is roughish, rogueish, riffish and raffish sadly, as I have found in a lot of English towns. It is a variable feast, but there's plenty to see and do especially if you are young and enjoy smoking pot.\n\nThe hotel is very grand (common parts) as it was I think an insurance company HQ back in the day. The rooms are OK - large, but bathrooms are rather dated, and towels not fluffy enough for me.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful indeed. The bar is well-stocked and run. The common parts living room was nice too The breakfast was really nicely done.\n\nOverall, it is pricier than some places, but it has charm, character, is welcoming and does much well. I would go back.\n\nSome charming photos to help you decide whether to go to Norwich or Not(wich).",

Unfortunately it soon became clear the hotel certainly isn't up to its 4 star claim. Very old single glazed windows with no secondary glazing, meaning I could hear normal volume conversations and literally any coughs from passers by even from the 4th floor - St Giles is not a quiet street either. Wi-fi password given during check in, would be great if you could actually connect to the network from the room, which you can't so no wi-fi. Went to take a bath, body wash looked good quality even if screwed to the wall, would have been even better if it wasn't totally empty. Noise was so bad at night I had to drag the mattress through to the lounge area and sleep on the floor, during this process I discovered that under the nice clean bed sheet was a nice urine stain on the mattress / mattress cover! Extractor fan in shower room - broken! Any issues outside of normal working hours in a 4 star hotel just pop down to the front desk right? Wrong, you're given a mobile number on a piece of card in your room to call! Given the front door can be walked through by literally anyone through the night with nobody on the door and no card access required I would say that's a slight concern to have no night duty staff member about. I emailed most of the above concerns to the hotel after my first night and a few weeks later am still to receive any response, not even an apology. I checked out after 1 night and slept on the floor at someone else's house instead, to sum it up when I went to hand my key in at reception it had nobody there. Avoid avoid avoid.",

Set in a park out of the way of main roads, it was a quiet area. The swimming pool is well maintained and was a welcome on the hot day we checked in. I like the idea of a security gate that requires an access code as you know your children are going to be safe. The only downside is that the mattress requires replacing as every spring was felt when sitting or laying on it, and that we had received an email to say the clubhouse and bar would not be open. We found that this was because of a license hiccup when new owners took over the park, but this was not a massive issue for us but would have been nice to have somewhere to go in the evenings. The park is a short drive from most of the coastal towns and children's attractions such as Roar and Pettetts farm. Overall a lovely place with friendly staff and holidaymakers",

There are barely any mirrors and no dedicated stretching space, which makes it hard to complete a full workout routine. Also no water fountain!!!\n\nCleanliness is another major issue. The locker rooms & the showers often have a musty smell, random pipes hanging out. The changing rooms are freezing, and a cleaner even told us that they don’t put the heating on ever.

For a fast surface, you really need to see where the ball is to judge the bounce but it's a struggle - though I guess you'd get used to it over time.\n\nThe tennis bubble is brighter when the sun is out but that brings its own issues (with heat and glare, as it's only a single thin skin).  Once again, once the sun goes down, the place is barely lit at all.  Not great when trying to see fine line calls  😕  The hard courts in there are slower and easier for less experienced players.\n\nDidn't try the astroturf courts.\n\nFood and drink isn't cheap, and costs more for non-members (tiny cup of coffee is £3.50) and the social space is cramped and doesn't come across as particularly welcoming.\n\nStaff are friendly and accommodating.\n\nChanging rooms and toilets are very basic but clean.\n\nFree Wi-fi.\n\nAccess from main road is a bit hairy, only one single lane entrance as far as I can tell.

I had a great stay. The food and drinks systems were down everything was on paper, which must have been very stressful for the staff, however they all acted commendably during it all. The food was delicious, and reasonably priced. Breakfast included was top notch. Somome came into my room while I was at work and changed my bed and provided fresh towels. It was just a remarkable experience. Would highly recommend if you are staying in the area.",

They were very kind and obliged all children guests with a  BIG sundae. Very thoughtful!!\nThe food tastes great. It is located at 7-8 mins drive to The city centre.

There is a fridge available in a communal lounge area, and a dinning area, which looked to be used as a play room, not surprisingly they do allow you to bring in your own food.

It came to a certain time after they ate their BBQ food, they got the alcohol ready and let the children do whatever.\nI'm all for adults having a good time too, but there's nothing wrong with telling their kids to not kick balls at people's caravan and tents, to not ride bikes through others pitches when they are sitting quietly with their dogs. There's so much space, gardens, grounds , Park etc.\nAlso, parents should be keeping an eye on very young ones going into the bathrooms by themselves. The poo on the toilet seats in the ladies, with toilet roll covered in poo, not flushed is not nice to walk in to.\nThe kids all about the sinks, doing makeup at 8 years old and probably not washed their hands after the toilet, put me right off going back.\nThis is a family place with no respect for others without children.\n\nLocation was good, but needs fencing off for a bit of peace from kids kicking balls and riding bikes right next to you.

          "reviewText": "Recently stayed here with friends for a 50th birthday, on approach you are met with a beautiful view of Alton Water. As you enter the campsite there is a small building to the left where I believe you can book in, you follow the road and the toilet/shower block is to your right with camping pitches around it.\n\nThe pitches are not too badly sized and they do have electric hookup if needed, I believe there is bike trail you can use and I also saw someone with a fishing rod. They do allow kayaks but not inflatable.\n\nThe toilet/shower block are a bit smelly but they have showers, toilets, urinals, baby changing station, free hairdryers, shaving socket and mirrors with a lower sink for those that need it. It's worth noting they shut these toilets a 23:45, not sure why but if you need the loo during the night then the shrubbery between pitches is the only place to go. If you need to sit down you'll have to hold it till the morning.\n\nThis site does not allow campfires and this is enforced by two extremely rude wardens that ride around on an electric buggy, they are militant.\n\nWe had a group booking for a 50th birthday and unfortunately there was a family death shortly before camping at this site. Admittedly we did break the rules on the Friday and we put logs on our fire, the wardens came around and we expected to have a telling off but thought they may be firm but fair as the weather was very cold (expected this time of year I know). Not the case at all, these people are just rude and there's no other way to describe them, I tried apologising and asking them about their roles etc but they just ignored me and made us put water on the firepit. Now we're not talking about a a roaring fire on the ground, we have a firepit with Bluetooth technology to control a small fan and we were sitting under a gazebo so the fire was controlled. Nether the less we had a dispute, poured water on it and carried on with our evening. Fast forward to Saturday night and we had the coals going whilst we all sat round chatting and it was nice, the birthday boy decided to put one log on top of the coals and wouldn't you know it the buggy appeared out of nowhere and it kicked off. One of our members was a little drunk and loud and we mentioned that they'd recently lost their dad to which the female warden laughed! Now I know we shouldn't have put that log on the fire but to be honest I didn't think it would matter that much. However it did matter very much to the wardens who proceeded to ban all of us from returning to the site.\n\nIf you're on a day out and in the area then I would highly recommend visiting Alton Water, there is adequate parking and a lovely little cafe that overlooks the water.

          "reviewText": "Recently stayed here with friends for a 50th birthday, on approach you are met with a beautiful view of Alton Water. As you enter the campsite there is a small building to the left where I believe you can book in, you follow the road and the toilet/shower block is to your right with camping pitches around it.\n\nThe pitches are not too badly sized and they do have electric hookup if needed, I believe there is bike trail you can use and I also saw someone with a fishing rod. They do allow kayaks but not inflatable.\n\nThe toilet/shower block are a bit smelly but they have showers, toilets, urinals, baby changing station, free hairdryers, shaving socket and mirrors with a lower sink for those that need it. It's worth noting they shut these toilets a 23:45, not sure why but if you need the loo during the night then the shrubbery between pitches is the only place to go. If you need to sit down you'll have to hold it till the morning.\n\nThis site does not allow campfires and this is enforced by two extremely rude wardens that ride around on an electric buggy, they are militant.\n\nWe had a group booking for a 50th birthday and unfortunately there was a family death shortly before camping at this site. Admittedly we did break the rules on the Friday and we put logs on our fire, the wardens came around and we expected to have a telling off but thought they may be firm but fair as the weather was very cold (expected this time of year I know). Not the case at all, these people are just rude and there's no other way to describe them, I tried apologising and asking them about their roles etc but they just ignored me and made us put water on the firepit. Now we're not talking about a a roaring fire on the ground, we have a firepit with Bluetooth technology to control a small fan and we were sitting under a gazebo so the fire was controlled. Nether the less we had a dispute, poured water on it and carried on with our evening. Fast forward to Saturday night and we had the coals going whilst we all sat round chatting and it was nice, the birthday boy decided to put one log on top of the coals and wouldn't you know it the buggy appeared out of nowhere and it kicked off. One of our members was a little drunk and loud and we mentioned that they'd recently lost their dad to which the female warden laughed! Now I know we shouldn't have put that log on the fire but to be honest I didn't think it would matter that much. However it did matter very much to the wardens who proceeded to ban all of us from returning to the site.\n\nIf you're on a day out and in the area then I would highly recommend visiting Alton Water, there is adequate parking and a lovely little cafe that overlooks the water. I believe you have access to a bike trail as well, parking is controlled by ANPR.\n\nIf you are looking to camp then the site is beautiful and open, all music has to be off by 22:00 so it's very peaceful to go to sleep but unfortunately due to the shrubbery being cut to knee height you have no barrier from the wind so feels a lot colder than it is and it's quite expensive for a pitch in my opinion\n\nAs long as you follow the rules to the letter you should be okay, the showers have very low water pressure and unfortunately have a very strong smell of urine (even after \"cleaning\"), I believe there is a fridge and a freezer in the entrance to the toilets/showers but they weren't clean when I visited, there are water spigots on the electric points but the water is highly chlorinated so will need to be boiled more than once.",

However you can hear the distance noise pollution from train/cars so if you are noise sensitive in the evening, bring ear plugs! Nevertheless, the evenings were peaceful with just us (and the others occupying the 2nd tent), our pitfire and the stars. It felt very relaxing stepping away from the daily grind and tv/phones. They have really good wifi service but the aura of the place encourages you to detach. The bed was very cosy and the tent is spacious enough. The stove helps keep us warm in the evening for sure! The shared kitchen is full of amenities and they thought of everything you needed for the bbq. Also private toilet was deffo a plus and having hot water shower was handy! We also tried their pizza brick oven and the owners lent us a helping hand when they noticed us struggling a bit since it was a first time. This is also our first glamping experience and we’d love to come back here for more exploring and star gazing. The hosts are lovely, and so is the place! Keep up the good service - experience was great! I",

It was unusual to have proper hot water showers and we really appreciated them as it was a very chilly weekend. It feels very family run and nothing was too much trouble for the hosts.

They are also shingled hard standing.\n\nThe bad bits.\n\nI know it was a bank holiday but they really pack the vans in. There is a single one way track round the whole site. The plots are all off this, centrally and along the edges. They are spaced the minimum distance apart and the service road is narrow  which makes pitching up a little difficult if you want to reverse in. There is no green space for children to play apart from what is on each individual plot. The children's \"play area\" is a small fenced off section with a plastic play house and a couple of swings. Worse,  it is right opposite the toilet disposal point and rubbish area and next to a storage yard. The dog walking area runs along one edge directly behind the caravans that are pitched along that section. So on a nice day, you could watch the dog walkers picking up after their dogs behind your van while you sat outside.\n\nThe site shop is very small with limited stocks. There is a tesco store about 10 minutes drive however.\n\nMost pitches looked to be seasonal with regular visitors whose vans are permanently pitched.\n\nI know that we stayed on a bank holiday but the cost per night was just a tad under £30 per night!\n\nSeasonal charges were around  £1700 per year. It seems that whoever owns the land is very much running the site as a cash cow.\n\nIt is well placed for trips out and is near to the A14.\n\nIf you are looking for greenery and trees, look elswhere though. I would not be rushing back I'm afraid.",

Polite and friendly staff, clean and tidy centre and good value for money. Car park will be busy, so be prepared to hunt for a spot midday! Parking is set to 4 hours stay if you use the iPads and put in your number plate in.\n\nOverall a superb day out and will defiantly be visiting again",

Used plasters (bio hazards) dirty nappies, general dirt and grime. I understand that the persons are at fault for leaving these behind initially, but nothing had been touched when we got out. Is there not a duty of care for customers? There was no evidence of regular general cleaning happening whatsoever. Expecting customers to make staff aware during a visit is an unfair response, surely cleanliness should be a priority. I would have expected there to be some kind of set standard. Such a shame to tarnish an otherwise nice afternoon out.",

I am beyond impressed and happy with the progress she made so far. It wouldn't of happened, of course, without amazing swimming teachers Oliver and Gemma. They go above and beyond to make sure she feels safe and capable, and encourage her to try new techniques. She absolutely loves her teachers and I cannot be more thankful and appreciate the wonderful work that they are doing with all the children attending. I love that the classes are small, so Oliver and Gemma have enough time and attention to give to each child. Also the swimming pool is good size and not too deep, location is beautiful.\nWe will never be changing Isla's swimming school/teachers. If anyone in doubt regarding choosing the right teachers - run not walk, if there are any spaces left. Oliver and Gemma thank you from the bottom of my heart from me and Isla xxx.",

Having worked our way up through the different stages, I can see how carefully thought out the pitch and progression is at each level, from the songs and games in the baby stages to the water safety and development of strokes in the older classes. My daughters progression and confidence over the years has been a pleasure to watch, swimming independently from just 3 years old. We have been lucky enough to have kept the same teacher, Tiffany, throughout the 5 years, which has been an added bonus, she is outstanding! She builds relationships with both the children and the parents, enthuses fun and confidence into every lesson and clearly has a passion for swimming which passes through to her pupils!\nThe facilities are great, warm and clean with attention to detail. The office staff are equally brilliant, providing great communication about the lessons and always quick to respond to any emails.",

I have lost over 11 stone but still feel a little  self conscious despite the best efforts of Robin (The Manager and Personal Trainer).  This gym is perfect as it has quiet periods and. busier Ines allowing you to find your personal training zone.  I have found other members friendly and supportive without being intrusive or show offs either.  The private changing rooms set it apart from other low cost 24 hour gyms in the area.  Robin has recently taken over as Manager and he is passionate about health and fitness and has great ideas to move forward and help members achieve their goals.  It's well worth a look and visit and they have trial passes too.  Take that first step into this gym and look forward to a healthier, fitter you. I have and it works.",

So I hope this review is somewhat insightful and useful for when thinking of joining a gym in the area.\n\nThere are four main areas I feel are quite important to critique on a gym. Which are: staff, facilities, cleanliness and its level of business. All of which is taking into account of its membership price ( from £38 per month).\n\nThe staff are generally nice and friendly. I had no problems with them. I did find it slightly unprofessional that some of their staff are just on their phones the whole time they are on the reception desk and therefore not ready to be attentive. They do not even look up sometimes?\n\nI felt they have a good range of equipment. Cardio to weights ratio. The gym does have a swimming pool, sauna, steam room, chaining rooms with lockers and showers. All of which are fine but for almost £40 a month, I would expect more. A larger majority of the equipment and machines were fairly old. More budget friendly gyms nearby have even more modern equipment and machines.\n\nThe level of cleanliness is good in the gym floors but the showers smelt awful and the other facilities were not much better in terms of cleanliness and smell. As a result, I used the other facilities other than the gym floor a handful of times.\n\nNow finally its level of business is pretty much its biggest pro and one of the main reasons I stayed for as long as I did. During most of the time it’s open, it is really quiet and enjoyable. There was little to no waiting time between different exercises. So it saved me a lot time, I could get a good workout at good amount of time!\n\nOverall, Fitness4Less in Colchester does have some good things to it but I do not believe it is maximising its potential. I feel with a little bit of love (investment to refurbishment) it can be an awesome gym. If it was cheaper, I would give it higher ratings as the price should reflect exceptions. Currently, I personally do not believe it justifies £40 a month.",

I want to highlight that the facilities themselves are excellent: the rooms are bright with large windows, there is plenty of storage space, and the bathroom water pressure is consistently strong and reliable. In terms of living environment and hardware, HOST does very well.\n\nUnfortunately, my overall experience was affected by repeated negative interactions with one receptionist (a blonde lady), whose manner of communication I found highly unprofessional and at times disrespectful.\n\n•\tOn September 14, 2024, the date of my scheduled move from the en-suite to the studio, I had just returned from a short trip (Sept 9–13). Early that morning, she knocked on my door very aggressively. When I answered, she spoke in a scolding tone, telling me something like: “You must vacate this room before X o’clock!!!” (I don’t recall the exact time). While I understand she may have intended this as a reminder, the manner in which she spoke made me feel as if I had done something wrong or was being treated as a problem. I was on the phone at the time, and even the friend on the other end of the call commented, “Who was that? Why is she speaking to you in that way? You shouldn’t let anyone talk to you like that.”\n\n•\tOn another occasion, when I went to collect a parcel, she happened to be outside reception smoking. After confirming I was there to pick up my package, she suddenly said in an accusatory tone: “I sent you an email—you should have replied! This is about the Friday viewing for your room.” This left me feeling very uncomfortable. I am a paying resident, not an employee obligated to respond instantly to management’s convenience. While I always check my emails, I don’t believe it is fair or professional for staff to demand immediate responses or to speak to tenants as if they were subordinates.\n\n•\tFinally, regarding my move-out, my tenancy contract clearly stated that my final day was September 6, 2025. However, in early August, when I was simply picking up a parcel, I was once again approached and asked: “When can you return your keys earlier? We need time to clean because someone wants to move into your room sooner.” This repeated pressure to leave before the contractual end date was unreasonable…\n\nHowever, my experience was significantly undermined by the unprofessional behavior of one receptionist…",

In terms of living environment and hardware, HOST does very well.\n\nUnfortunately, my overall experience was affected by repeated negative interactions with one receptionist (a blonde lady), whose manner of communication I found highly unprofessional and at times disrespectful.\n\n•\tOn September 14, 2024, the date of my scheduled move from the en-suite to the studio, I had just returned from a short trip (Sept 9–13). Early that morning, she knocked on my door very aggressively. When I answered, she spoke in a scolding tone, telling me something like: “You must vacate this room before X o’clock!!!” (I don’t recall the exact time). While I understand she may have intended this as a reminder, the manner in which she spoke made me feel as if I had done something wrong or was being treated as a problem. I was on the phone at the time, and even the friend on the other end of the call commented, “Who was that? Why is she speaking to you in that way? You shouldn’t let anyone talk to you like that.”\n\n•\tOn another occasion, when I went to collect a parcel, she happened to be outside reception smoking. After confirming I was there to pick up my package, she suddenly said in an accusatory tone: “I sent you an email—you should have replied! This is about the Friday viewing for your room.” This left me feeling very uncomfortable. I am a paying resident, not an employee obligated to respond instantly to management’s convenience. While I always check my emails, I don’t believe it is fair or professional for staff to demand immediate responses or to speak to tenants as if they were subordinates.\n\n•\tFinally, regarding my move-out, my tenancy contract clearly stated that my final day was September 6, 2025. However, in early August, when I was simply picking up a parcel, I was once again approached and asked: “When can you return your keys earlier? We need time to clean because someone wants to move into your room sooner.” This repeated pressure to leave before the contractual end date was unreasonable…\n\nHowever, my experience was significantly undermined by the unprofessional behavior of one receptionist…",

We were ok with our 8m 7'6\" caravan. Just take it slowly.\nThe padlocked gate is set back from the road so there's plenty of room to clear the main road before needing to stop for the gate.\nThe site has 5 spacious grass pitches with EHU points.\nThe two water taps are at either end of the fence.\nThere's two little wash/shower/toilet rooms, though the shower is coin operated from outside!  So we used our caravan shower instead.\nThe alpacers and horses were lovely to see, it added to our stay.\nDidn't see the owners in the 8 days we were there, but they are very responsive to emails and were nice and helpful.\nGood walks from the site and there's a cafe in the garden centre opposite.\nWe had a lovely stay and would return again when we are in the area. 😎👍👍👍👍",

We were ok with our 8m 7'6\" caravan. Just take it slowly.\nThe padlocked gate is set back from the road so there's plenty of room to clear the main road before needing to stop for the gate.\nThe site has 5 spacious grass pitches with EHU points.\nThe two water taps are at either end of the fence.\nThere's two little wash/shower/toilet rooms, though the shower is coin operated from outside!  So we used our caravan shower instead.\nThe alpacers and horses were lovely to see, it added to our stay.\nDidn't see the owners in the 8 days we were there, but they are very responsive to emails and were nice and helpful.\nGood walks from the site and there's a cafe in the garden centre opposite.\nWe had a lovely stay and would return again when we are in the area. 😎👍👍👍👍",

Easy to find, entrance is narrow but we managed with no issues with big twin axle.\n\nSite is a lovely short cut field set back from the road with trees and hedge for summer sun shelter. It was really easy to pitch as it's fairly level. Road noise was not an issue and it was really quiet at night.\n\nEHU & recycling, chemical disposal is a manhole but fine for these small sites. What some small campervans might really like is the 2x shower/loo cubicles, very clean and nice, use of the hot shower is charged via a coin meter.\n\nThe highlight was the Alpaca's in the ajoining field so cute and peaceful to just sit and watch.\n\nLocation is great for visit to Colchester and some lovely country bike rides.",

The whole week we were there the chemical waste was blocked and because there is no telephone contact we had to email them to let them know, There is a tap on the side of the toilet block for swilling down after emptying the toilet water but no hose on it so unable to wash down the area after emptying chemical waste, So to reiterate this site has no real access for a standard 8mt twin axle van, Sorry but we will not be back.",

Heated out door swimming pool, driving range, mini golf, pitch and put, bike hire, the list goes on. On site fish and chips and restaurant was very good value. Evening entertainment was good and we won on the cash bingo. The only thing that I will say was that our caravan was very near the complex and could be quite loud in the evenings. Not a problem for us but anyone with young kids trying to get them to sleep might struggle with the noise a bit. But a great stay and would recommend to anyone to stay here. Oh and this place is literally on a beach, it was less than a 2 minute walk from our caravan and we were more or less the centre of the campsite",
