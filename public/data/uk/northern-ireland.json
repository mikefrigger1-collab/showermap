It brought back bad memories of attending it when I went to Templemore Avenue Primary School across the road. Mr Stanford was the Headmaster then, and once a week we walked over to swim. The chlorine smell from it was pungent. Building looked intimidating and we all dreaded Mr Kirkwood, the resident swimming instructor. He was frightening, green baggy tracksuit, Bobby Charlton comb over and whistle round his neck. He shouted at and bullied us kids. Getting changed in horrible cubicles by the pool was dismal. Your skin stank of chlorine. Then you were rushed to get out and dry. We were walking on the backs of shoe heels to get out. The television program gave some folk a voice, so this is my chance. They had the cherub fountain displayed all clean. I remember it a hideous thing covered in moss full of weeds. As a warning of the swimming session to come. They wouldn't get away with it today. My opinion, yours may be different. David Allen. ( Manchester).",

Mainly since schools started, they OVERCROWD the SWIM FOR ALL sessions in the afternoon where all lanes are taken away for school lessons and anyone that booked SWIM FOR ALL (today there was 25 of us) were crammed into the side, which was made even smaller at 6.15pm. This is not realistic or enjoyable because that section is used by kids and adults with babies so you can't swim in a lane one by one like you do when the FAST OR SLOW lanes are open, rather you try to avoid being kicked. SO, the staff should leave at least one sectioned off SLOW LANE for people that want to swim. I was in a group of 4, as there was no space to swim, we left after 20mins and we wanted a refund, which was not given so I feel robbed to be honest as its not fair to pay nearly 20 quid for 20mins.\n\nThe manager on duty 'Martin' was completely disrespectful, condescending, repetitive and UNPROFESSIONAL. He accused me of being disrespectful from begining after we had to wait 15mins for him because he was extremely 'busy' talking to colleagues, and the man at the reception who was very friendly and helpful but couldn't help with a refund, kept saying go over to the door to the pool (restricted for staff only) and get Martin. So I tried getting Martin, and basically got told in a rude manner to wait as he's extremely busy and he'll get to us when he's got time. He then refused to listen to the problem (as just explained above) and provide an acceptable solution, rather kept repeating several times how I booked the wrong session and I should book the Fitness session and how this is normal (getting bashed in the face by others and going to a swimming pool to not swim), which I explained is not right for several reasons. Additionally the times that fitness sessions are offered are ridiculous, either really early or late in the day.\n\nSo will try one of the other Swimming pools in Belfast or surrounding areas, and Olympia really needs to get better management....",

Part of my all inclusive Gll better membership cant wait to avail of what else is on offer. Next stop spa experience! 👍\n\nHaving spent few hours over two days to make a booking for the spa, partly due to my phone being broke, was told to come the following day around 2.30! So the girl explained a few things again registered me on the computer in the spa department now 3pm told me then to come come back at 3.45 so sat in my car till then left my two towels, went to spa, my towel was drenched, when I went to get showered asked the girl for another one, No unfortunately we can only give one! I had two with me and left them at my car as the girl stated we provide towels flip flops, would advise to bring your own towels even better a dressing gown in the towel material be handy. Steam room was out of use, ice room is a bowl of ice only, the showers and changing room is about the size of a disabled toilet! In there you have lockers on one side seating on the other & 3 showers were you must keep hitting the button for water as it goes off about every 5-6 seconds no shampoo or conditioner in either. The decor is beautiful, spa I dont know experience yes, definitely one I'm now thankful is now behind me. Cancelling my membership was another story, told I couldn't  cancel until I played the £3 no show fee for a class I did not book. Between the spa receptionist and call handler hospitality at its worst!!! 👎👎👎👎👎I have worked in hospitality for twenty years, making life more difficult for a person does not come into it anywhere! I would suggest staff be trained in hospitality they will learn alot. It's all about making things as straightforward for the individual availing of your services\nI hope everyone who attends this place of business has a better experience than I did.",

          "reviewText": "I joined this gym at around 3pm on a Saturday because I specifically wanted to start training that same day. However, it was not made clear during the sign up process that if you join outside staffed hours, you cannot access the gym until someone is there to give you access. That would have been fine if it had been clearly stated, but it was not. I paid £63 to join and then discovered I could not use the gym at all, which was very disappointing.\n\nWhen I emailed to raise the issue, I received a phone call from a staff member (possibly the manager). The way he spoke to me was extremely unprofessional. He was super aggressive, defensive, dismissive, and offered no apology and just told me I was wrong even though I was sitting looking at the sign up info. The call was hostile and not at all helpful. I’m not actually sure why he called me to be honest. It just seemed like he wanted to have a go at someone rather than actually help in any way, it was a total waste of time. Had I been able to cancel immediately after that call and not been tied down for a year, I would not have continued with the membership. I was really shocked at how he spoke to me.\n\nThe gym itself was okay. Most of the lockers upstairs did not work the entire year I was a member. The hand dryers in the bathrooms are really bad and unlike other (cheaper) gyms I have been to, some common machines for training were not there.\n\nWhen I later emailed to enquire about cancelling at the end of my contract, the responses I received from Mark were blunt, unhelpful, and unclear. After cancellation, my access was cut off earlier than it should have been. I was told my final access day would be the 30th, but it was cut off on the 29th, and I had already paid for access into the following month until 2nd December inclusive. I emailed to question this and request a refund for the days owed or have the days added on, but never received a reply.\n\nAside from this, every other staff member I interacted with in person was friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall, I would not return. There are better gyms nearby for the same or lower price with better communication, better equipment availability, and much better customer service.",

We weren't greeted with a hello or even a smile. When I told them my name and that we were here to check in one of the girls simply said follow me and got into a van and drove off. It was a very strange experience.\n\nWhen we got to the accommodation, the girl handed us the key and left. She did not explain how to work the hot tub or how to turn on the heating for the accommodation.\n\nThe carpet in the room had dirt, stones and twigs on it like it hadn't been hoovered before our arrival. The towels provided had orange and black stains on them. The bed had hairs in it.\n\nWhen we went to use the hot tub the first evening, the lid of the hot tub was rotting away and had huge holes so there were leaves, twigs, bugs, and other debris floating around in the murky water. It was disgusting. Not to mention that the water was lukewarm despite the outside heating button being on since we had arrived.\n\nThat night we couldn't figure out how to work the heating as we were not told and there were no instructions or guides available within the accommodation. It was absolutely freezing all night; we had to sleep with joggers and hoodies over our pyjamas.\n\nWhen we went to the spa, the hot tubs were not even lukewarm in temperature, they were genuinely cold. We could not even sit in one of them for more than 30 seconds. I had even asked the woman at the spa reception were the hot tubs turned on because I couldn't believe how cold they were. She informed me that was just the temperature that they always were. Which is strange as a hot tub should be hot. This was such a disappointment. We had to spend the entire hour and a half in the sauna, taking breaks by walking up and down the path. We were extremely let down.\n\nI spent a total of £460 for this weekend trip which is a complete waste of money. We could have gone to the Galgorm for an overnight stay and a visit to the spa village for less than that and we would have had an amazing time.",

The staff were so informative and friendly and just all around nice to talk too. At the reception, lounge and breakfast staff in the morning. The rooms where clean and spotless. The swimming area is amazing for kids. My kids loved it! The food is amazing and sleeping here was like sleeping in the clouds and it was so quiet and peaceful! It really is the best hotel I've stayed at so much that I've booked to stay here on my birthday in December and I cannot wait 🙂 was so easy to drive to and get a parking space aswell. Brilliant 10/10.",

I saw other children who were much younger and when asked the staff they said we appreciate you didn’t lie like others.

Sections of the pool, which is an irregular shape, are divided into  slides/splash area, an area for families, and a section for lane swimming. The outdoor pool is part of a leisure centre with indoor pool, but access to the outdoor pool is separate to the leisure centre and can be reached via the car park. Plenty of free parking. We went for an early morning lane swim - there were only 4 of us in the pool, so plenty of space and the local/regular swimmers made us feel really welcome (even giving us 'Friends of Aldershot Lido' swimming caps, which were a lovely souvenir of our visit). The laned section of the pool is about 25-30m & fairly deep. Pool is well maintained and lovely to see the traditional fountain in operation. Changing facilities are basic but clean & clean toilets and hot showers. Lockers available poolside, but bring padlock. Overall we really enjoyed our visit 😊",

I think they do this to keep the 'bodybuilder types' from intimidating other gym goers?\n\nUpstairs, you'll find the class studio which hold many of it's classes (but no spin bikes or spin classes), and the changing rooms are cool too - both have saunas in them for post workout recovery.\n\nIt's open 24 hours a day 7 days a week and you get unlimited free parking too.\n\nHave a look around if you're not sure about joining, but I guarantee you won't find a better deal than this place.",

And if it isn’t the steam room it’s the poorly heated excuse of a sauna. Most of the time the jacuzzi is just warm not hot enough to want to stay in it unless you are in it just for the quick picture with champagne which most people are. £50 a month would be amazing if the place was run well and maintained.

I wasnt sure if to get out of the car so I phoned the staff and the girl on the phone said she will come soon. After a few minutes wait I went inside and same person said that I was told she will come and to move as she is serving other people, said that her colleague was on break. I asked for the refund as was in a rush but was told that isnt possible. When the fella came out he resumed the machine he put the shortest programme while I paid for the more advanced one. I asked for the refund of the difference after and again was refused as it 'came of my card' lol and I can come back tomorrow morning to speak to a manager. Really poor service; its not the first time of a poor experience on that station and I generally would avoid this place.",

The bed was so comfortable as was the sofa bed, large shower, safe, iron board, iron, hairdryer, tea coffee facilities, large tv free wifi. The room was so cosy and clean.

Just behind the hotel there is a street with plenty of restaurants, food spots and a few small shops, which makes it easy to find something to eat without going far.\nA big plus is the free on-site parking for guests, which is not easy to find in this part of the city. The hotel also has a small gym, useful if you want to stay active during your trip.\nThe rooms are clean and well-equipped, perfect for a short stay. Everything you need is provided: towels, hairdryer, kettle with coffee, tea and milk. The room was comfortable and practical.\nBreakfast is what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express: croissants, bread, jam, chocolate spread, scrambled eggs, rashers, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, cereals with milk, coffee, tea and orange juice. Nothing fancy, but absolutely fine and more than enough for a 1–2 night stay.\nThere is also a bar and a comfortable lounge area, nice for relaxing in the evening.\nOverall, a very good choice for location, comfort and value for money. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Belfast.",

They helped me out and Thomas provided me with a highlighted map of key places to see around Belfast and great insight into the places which was fantastic! The shower pressure and heat was top tier and the sheets provided were soft. Another bonus was the free breakfast, coffee, tea and pasta and rice! I highly recommend this hostel when visiting Belfast!",

You are given the code before you arrive.\n\nIt was a very interesting stay having never completed a touch less stay.  The room was immaculately clean!  Towels were not luxurious but did the trick.  The room itself was a full size bed which comfortably fit my wife and I.  The room itself was in the smallish size, think bedroom in an older home.  The city noises kept my wife awake one night, lots of traffic, sirens, people walking the ally and all.  For me, it was white noise.  If you’re a sensitive to noise sleeper, you may want to weigh this heavily!\n\nThe location was great!  We were 20 minutes walking from pretty much everywhere we wanted to be.  25 minutes from Belfast Grand Central Station.\n\nThe breakfast was good!  Continental with fruit, yogurt, cereals, breads, butter jams etc.  You will be adequately fed for the day!\n\nBy no means is this hotel luxurious? But it is clean, fun and reasonably priced.  I rather enjoyed our stay!  We took a tour of the northern Irish coast and the pickup was very close so it worked well.  Cheers!!",

The bedroom was really tiny, the door kept banging it self on the door frame with the wind even when closed. The bathrooms are not onsuite so you are sharing, the showers are fully separated too so not a lot of privacy.

There is no security on site so I raised this with the cafe staff member who said gates would be closed when they left at 5pm as their cars were parked in there. Gates still left open after they left.  I called an emergency no at 7.30pm to advise same as I had read a previous review about Travellers previously arriving on site and the site being open to anyone was a concern. I was advised that someone would be contacted and they would come to check and close the gates. No one bothered to come to site, gates were open all night so no security at all. No point in issuing a barrier code if gates are not closed anyway other than to use showers/toilet so we could have just turned up without paying, parked up, used our own facilities and had a free night. Not great.",

          "reviewText": "Nice quiet spot, lovely view to lakes from camper van. £30 for one night with electric and we arrived after 6pm and left  by 9am. Only 1 shower working in ladies loo, only one overhead light working. Small play area for kids. Nothing within walking distance to do so bare in mind you will have to drive if you want to do anything. When you drive in you may think it's a mistake as you literally drive into a farm yard, then goi drive up around some sheds up a narrow lane and you find the site with a lot of permanent mobile holiday homes. Only space for about 5 caravans or campers at most. Facilities were clean enough. Think it's more suited to people looking for a quiet rest and not to move about much, wouldn't really say it's for families.",

Only 1 shower working in ladies loo, only one overhead light working. Small play area for kids.

The pitches are mostly situated in a circle surrounding the large grassed area where tents can be pitched and also provides a perfect place for children to gather and play games. We were on pitch number 16 and there was a well worn path into the woods right beside our van which the children made frequent use of.  It didn't bother us in the least but there was a wider and more popular access to the woods on the next pitch to ours. There were 4 toilets and 2 showers for women plus a unisex(?) accessible bathroom. The 2 showers were fine with plenty of hot water but go early to avoid having to wait. They were very clean but small. The campsite is just under a mile from Strangford village. There is a pavement all the way. There are at least 3 nice restaurants in Strangford plus a ferry to Portaferry every 30 mins. You can walk to Castle Ward itself in about 20 mins from the campsite.  It's a lovely building and well worth a visit. The whole estate is more than 800 acres so miles and miles of paths to explore.",

Guinness was excellent and over the course of the evening the barman came over for a bit of unobtrusive conversation about the area, places to visit, canoeing locations and then poetry.

We registered with the bar on arrival, having booked on line, the barman showed us to the facilities and was very welcoming.  Later we went in to the pub for a pint.  Guinness was excellent and over the course of the evening the barman came over for a bit of unobtrusive conversation about the area, places to visit, canoeing locations and then poetry.  We ended up leaving with a couple of books of poetry he insisted we took with us, to return whenever it suited the following morning.\nWe will be back.",

The only ones in this facility are the type where you have to hold the button the entire time. Completely pointless. Noticed they kept taking a ‘good’ hairdryer away every few weeks now there is no good ones at all. Thank god I moved to MJs down the road, not as limiting in terms of the hours you can use them and guess what? ZERO kids just as a gym is supposed to be because your paying to actually use all of the facilities instead of being limited when there’s toddlers running about. Too expensive to not be able to use it when you want, or without PROPER facilities such as decent hairdryers in place. Awkward placed plugs so you cannot even bring your own if management are going to reply saying that. Oh, and no social media to inform customers of anything just sign posts whilst you are on the premises.\n\nPOOR QUALITY.",

We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.\n\nI would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!\n\nAfter we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!\n\nWe hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!\n\nMy friend and I have been on a few different spa days together around Bristol and this by far took the number 1 spot! Thank you to all who made our treat day so wonderful! We will be back!",

I must say we were blown away by the whole experience more queens club than David Lloyd’s and with bells on . This lido was refurbished and reopened to the public in 2007 . Architecturally beautiful and lovingly restored with incredible attention to detail from the pool side cubicle changing curtains to the tasteful period furniture in the upper floors . The members and staff , friendly and charming shared their special place with us and we very much appreciated . Pool , steam , sauna and jacuzzi left us refreshed and ready for breakfast. Changing rooms and shower  areas were super clean and tidy . Then to breakfast well !!! This was another level and unexpected , ibérico chop with Catalan beans duck egg , morcilla and membrillo was a Hispanic combination I would have only expected to find in heaven , congratulations to the genius who pulled that baby to the pass at menu development . As in many cases sadly wonderful food not matched by service , would you like some toast with that or anything else we can get you would have been nice and a simple upsell , regardless come to expect these things and move on albeit annoying. Having said that the food quality setting and environment made for one of the most memorable breakfast. Thank you .",

Quite cold but nice if you go into the sauna first.\nJacuzzi: much warmer, spent most of my time here. Low on bubbles and very relaxing.\nSauna: pretty large and spacious. You need your towel for this one.\nSteam room: my preferred hot one. It got pretty steamy in there, especially if you stand up. Sitting down was easy.\n\nWe had breakfast there also and it was delicious; well worth our trip out from London.",

The water temperature was ideal — warm enough to be comfortable even on the coldest days, but still refreshing. The pool area was clean and well-maintained, and the locker rooms were tidy with plenty of space.\n\nWhat really stood out was the atmosphere: calm, relaxing, and perfect for both exercise and leisure. The staff were welcoming and always ready to help, ensuring everything ran smoothly. Whether you’re a serious swimmer or just looking to unwind, this is the perfect spot for winter swimming. I’ll definitely be coming back regularly this season!",

The cold bucket was fun after the sauna too.\nI wish they provided some flip flops as I forgot mine (even if they’re paid for) and wish there was more comfortable seating around to read a book as this seemed limited but didn’t detract from my overall experience.\nI also got very cold from being wet and sat outside before my massage and even after I showered I wish I’d brought an extra towel so I wasn’t sat back in a wet robe (didn’t think ahead).\nI had a full body massage and the massage rooms sit above the edge of the pool. You can hear the indistinct chatter and clanging of cutlery but I actually found this to be really relaxing rather than it being so quiet with a bit of spa music. The massage was amazing and I came out feeling so relaxed and the masseuse took me to the tea room and offered a selection of herbal teas after and it helped warm me back up.\nThe lunch was unbelievable - service was good and quick and very tasty.\nAll in all - such an amazing value spa day and really well done - there’s a few minor things that could be done to make the experience 5* overall but you can’t knock it!\nThank you so much",

          "reviewText": "Pros -\n\nReally thoughtfully refurbished and brought back to life. Plenty of choice when it comes to packages, combo deals. I liked the eucalyptus scent in the steam room. It felt quite spacious, considering it was a Saturday lunchtime - pool area was split into fast lane, medium lane and “chill and chat” lane. Sauna had a nice big window looking out onto the pool area, in fact generally speaking it felt quite light due to the big windows around the pool. 2 of us had neck, back, shoulder massage and facial (mine was by Michelle and my mum had Carole, who was also very good) and 1 of us had the exfoliator treatment, these were excellent and professional, felt super relaxed. Good quality herbal infusion made for us afterwards. I thought parking wasn’t bad value (£11 for the whole day paid on departure, although first 3 hours are free. Caution as there is a small car park directly in front of the Lido car park, which I believe is run by a different company). Dinner as part of the package was very good, better than we had been expecting, given some reviews. We paid extra for the steak, and had desserts. Staff explained procedures and timings / what to expect. Towel and robe provided for massage packages only (no footwear). Relaxed vibe - didn’t need to rush to get dressed post massage to enjoy our meal, we were able to eat whilst robed (I guess that could be off-putting for those only attending to eat).\n\nCons -\n\nOverall online booking process I found quite long-winded. The main pool was much colder than we were expecting (great as a cold plunge after sauna though). Hot tub was quite small, and by far the most popular area. Didn’t find jacuzzi that others mention in reviews, was there a button to activate in the hot tub? Car park is quite small, so limited availability. Some of the staff in the restaurant were not the most warm or welcoming. Would be lovely to have some fresh juices on the menu. Relax area post-massage was quite small, imagine it wouldn’t be that relaxing on a busy day. No area to lounge out and read a book, but to be honest if you booked the “swim, massage, meal” option I’m not sure where you’d find time to lounge as you’re so packed with activities and two hours pre-massage is just right to sample a little of all of the areas offered (sauna/steam/pool).",

We both work full time as key workers and simply could not have continued this work without the support we received from YMCA, who collect our girls from school and provide them with a fun and caring environment until we pick them up after work - it's very flexible up until 6pm and even when I thought I was going to be late one day there was never any stress from the staff. Diane showed us through the centre when we started and it was reassuring for us that the in-house routines and hand hygiene would minimise risk during the pandemic. The pick-up/drop-off system done by calling on arrival is safe and works well.\n\nThere are various different rooms that are all set up for a wide variety of active play and lots of different creative activities. The hall area gives the bigger kids lots of space for games and running around. The outdoor playground is compact but has recently been refurbished with artificial grass and new slides/gym equipment and the girls tell us they have lots of fun when they can go outside. So far we have had no problems whatsoever - our girls come out with big smiles on their faces after having had so much fun and stimulation in a safe and creative environment. They bring home lots of pieces of art and craft that they've been working on, all of which complements well the work they're doing at school. I can't fault any of the staff - they all engage so well with the girls and genuinely seem to love kids and enjoy the work they do. We get plenty of updates each day on the ParentZone app which lets us see what they are getting up to.\n\nI asked the girls to tell me what they like about YMCA:\n6 yo \"I love all the art that I can do there and there's lots of playing stuff that I like and good books. I like the Home Corner which is like a wee house with dressing-up stuff and a kitchen. The grown ups are always friendly and they like doing lots of art with the kids\"\n3 yo \"I like the reading books and playing there. Playing the floor is lava is fun!\"\n\nI would highly recommend this service as a trusted, fun and nurturing place to care for your kids that also provides very good value. I can only assume that they also provide a great nursery for the under 3s as well, but hopefully some other reviews can comment on that. I congratulate the staff for all their hard work, especially for the vital support they've given us as parents during this difficult year.  Despite all the challenges our two have never been happier. Keep up the good work!",

          "reviewText": "Wow! Onroute Truckstops have been very busy at Swindon! What an amazing difference! My last visit to Swindon was shall we say, ‘below expectations’; I really struggled to believe this was the same place.\n\nOn arrival the entrance was clean, clear and has obviously been attended to with the usual rubbish and debris cleared away. The security hut has had a complete refurb which was much needed. As a driver attending any truck stop if your first line of sight is dirt, rubbish and dilapidated buildings it immediately raises alarm bells as to what sort of site you’re visiting.  Signage to parking was clear and concise, and there was ample space available.  Traffic flow was moderate and free.\n\nFirst engagement was the canteen, by which entry was via a newly developed entrance.  Stunning.  New groundwork’s was colourful and very pleasing to the eye.  There were new picnic tables positioned outside - and were being used.  New plants were positioned, giving the homely welcome.  A huge effort has been made to greet customers to this area and the transformation from the old side entrance is worlds apart.  There are new big screens displaying menus, new information points, leaflets, all safety measures present, serviceable, in date and correctly placed where applicable.\n\nI met ‘Claire’ behind the counter, who was welcoming, bright and bubbly and just what you need to lift your spirits from the drama and stress of the highways. Also in attendance were approximately 4 other staff and the whole food counter experience was top class.  A very nice touch was a bowl of free healthy fruit for visitors. Well done there.  Food service was very quick - top marks.\n\nThe canteen was spotless. There were plenty of customers throughout the day (I was there for a 24hr stop) and I watched with interest the positive energy this team had going on. Everyone was greeted with a welcome and a smile.  No name badges though, I’d like to have seen that - it’s a more personal presentation to thank someone and show appreciation by referring to them by name. It’s also awkward to have to ask, maybe this should be considered. On the opposite side of the coin it equally encourages staff to deliver excellence as it’s much easier to identify individual failings. Certainly not the case here today however.\n\nNo sooner had a diner finished a staff member was instantly on hand to clean and disinfect and prepare the space for the next customer.  There was also excellent promotion and encouragement by the staff to download and use the Onroute app.\n\nFeedback: drivers are still struggling to find the SNAP terminals to pay for parking and are constantly having to queue and ask at the counter, disrupting staff from the catering flow.  The terminals hidden away in the toilet corridor and are not signed. A staff member had put a handwritten sign on the access door to highlight the location but was told by management to take it down. This was a poor decision and negatively impacted good staff initiative.  It may not have been ideal or as professional as a custom branded sign, but it was better than nothing!  There is still no clear signage to the SNAP payment terminals and needs addressed for full score achievement.\n\nThe shop was well stocked and inviting. It’s bright and has most of the essentials needed for drivers. As soon as I approached the shop a member of staff was there to assist if needed. I made several purchases and the whole experience again was very good.\n\nThe toilet corridor from the canteen leads to access snap terminals, ladies, gents and disabled toilets, and showers.  It was clean, fresh, clear of debris; and both snap terminals were fully functional. All fire safety measures were present, in date and clearly identified.  Health & Safety measures were also in place and being used effectively.\n\nUnfortunately I can’t give any further details as I’ve run out of characters! Happy to be contacted if necessary. Staff deserve special credit for a near perfect experience. Well done. Very well done.",

Since no one came out, we called the contact number, and the woman gave me directions to get a key that was inside a key box. I couldn't get it out. So she asked a friend who lived inside the house to let me in, and he then showed me how to get the key so I could leave later.\n\nThird: Our room was on the first floor and was clearly completely different from what the photos show. The room had spiders, was dirty, we found hair on the sheets, the pillow had dust stains, and the bedspread was stained. The mattress was terrible. The door only worked with a key, which was very awkward to open.\n\nFourth: The bathroom was dirty. The shower worked.\n\nFifth: The cell phone signal inside is very poor, so I asked for the Wi-Fi password via text message (the woman said she'd send it to me via WhatsApp, but she never did). She responded by simply typing the password, so I texted her again to ask for her name, and she responded about two hours later, with no kindness.\n\nWhen we arrived, we couldn't believe it. It's unfortunate that they offer such poor service, because the person isn't even friendly or there to greet you.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it at all!",

The room, kitchen, lounge area are all so beautiful, felt very special with lots of quirky touches. Nice to have an outdoor space too. Bed very comfortableabd great shower. Having a kitchen to use with fridge, oven and microwave was brilliant. Nice coffee and milk provided  an excellent touch. Location was great, walking distance to centre of town but in a nice, quiet area. Free, on-street parking outside is great if you have a car. Would absolutely stay here again.",

The room, kitchen, lounge area are all so beautiful, felt very special with lots of quirky touches. Nice to have an outdoor space too. Bed very comfortableabd great shower. Having a kitchen to use with fridge, oven and microwave was brilliant. Nice coffee and milk provided  an excellent touch. Location was great, walking distance to centre of town but in a nice, quiet area. Free, on-street parking outside is great if you have a car. Would absolutely stay here again.",

The style and decor throughout the hotel were tastefully done, with plenty of charming details that made it stand out from other places we've stayed in Ireland, even those with (way) higher price tags. From the artwork on the walls to the vintage pieces scattered around, the hotel exudes character and charm.\n\nWe were impressed by the friendly communication before our arrival and the warm welcome we received upon check-in. The staff were lovely and made us feel right at home.\n\nOne of the highlights for us was the shared kitchen facilities, which were well-equipped with everything we needed, including an oven, dishwasher, and coffee machine. It was convenient to have a space to store snacks and prepare simple meals, especially for day trips. The communal lounge area was also a nice touch, providing a cozy spot to relax and unwind. None of these things changed the vibe, which was much closer to a hotel than e.g. a room in a shared airbnb house.\n\nThe shower facilities were modern and clean, adding to the overall comfort of our stay.\n\nThe hotel's location couldn't be better, just a short walk from the city center with plenty of shops nearby. And the fact that street parking was free was a definite bonus.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It offered a comfortable and convenient base for exploring the city, with friendly staff and unique touches that made it feel like a home away from home. :-)",

Separate men’s and women’s toilets, each with a pleasant hot shower. No power sockets inside the shelter, but there’s a water tap outside. I slept very well and felt safe.

Being in a tent, I wasn't allowed the option of an electric hook up for 'safety reasons', so had no extra facilities! We were charged £30 per night for a patch of grass with access to a 'portacabin' toilet and coin operated shower which was temperamental and not always clean (on top of the pitch rental).\nWe're totally used to paying those kind of rates for a serviced site for a motorhome, but for an unserviced patch of grass, I feel is a rip-off!

All have electricity and most have also a tap and a drain for grey water. Touring pitches are large and offset, so nobody is looking directly into the van in front or behind. The site is well kept, and the facilities block is kept clean and tidy. You get a key to access the toilets and showers for which you pay a £2 refundable deposit.  In the ladies, there were approx 6 toilets, and I think 4 showers. You have to pay 20p for a shower, which would have been helpful to know when we checked in as it's a long walk to reception if you don't happen to have 20p.  Same to use the hairdryer. As far as we could see, there is only 1 area where rubbish can be left so, if you're in a touring van it's an awfully long walk.  There is a playground for children and large grassy areas for games. It's an ideal place for families.  There is also a gate that will lead you over the sand dunes onto Benone beach which is absolutely beautiful.\nWe are a retired couple so found the campsite a little crowded for our tastes. A little more information on check-in, such as a site map, would be helpful.",

Toilets, shower and changing rooms, sheltered area to sit and eat. Games tables, park, on site shop... They had orienteering that was on site and for £1 it turned out to be loads of fun with the children.. Then off course you can book to take park on their climbing wall, zip line, archery etc. Each day has different activities to choose from. This time of year offered the maize maze which was loads of fun but with our weather it was very muddy lol.. Still made for great memories.. Views are outstanding. I'd definitely return and book a pod or bell tent and stay longer to take part in more. They fact that it's a families only place makes you feel more comfortable and safe",

The sessions last for about an hour and a half. Good fun!",

We have been there today, temperature is 30c, and there are like 10 fitness swimmers, reserving the whole left side, and around 200 others all crowded in the other shallow corner of the pool. People kept trying to swim in the clearly less used area and life guards kept telling everyone off and asking them to leave the fitness side. There was one fast lane which was used by literally 2 swimmers. Clearly the priority in such days should be for people to have fun, and those \"Olympic\" swimmers could book the fast lane or book the indoor pool.

Went out to hot tub dirty glasses leftovers on plates , didn’t even get in the hot tub it was stinking, and our cocktails were literally dilute with no water disgusting and nothing like the photos on their Facebook page🤣 sent up to the quiet room where we were met with more dirty plates and cups with popcorn and bun crumbs everywhere, after the massages we were to get a fruit pladder which looks amazing on their Facebook and tea and coffee, we were brought a tiny bowl half filled with soggy fruit 🤣 we just up and walked out at that point, they then offered two free back massages and I declined straight away and said how much are they where I was told 49 each , I said I’d prefer the money and they fully agreed , only to see today they’ve sent me £50, and are now saying their massages are £25🤣🤣🤣 Do not go here",

I was visiting from Liverpool and was made up when my cousin booked us in here for the day.\nUnfortunately, when we arrived there was torrential rain, so once checked in we were invited to the relaxation suite were we had our fruit platter and first cocktail. The fruit platter was really fresh and well presented and the cocktail was really tasty. The relaxation suite was lovely and calm.\nWe then headed down to the changing room to change into our robes (provided by the spa) and from there, we entered the hottub, which was luckily undercover as it was still drizzling. The hottub was really warm and relaxing. We were promised another cocktail once we got in the hottub, but unfortunately this never happened. I understand that the staff members were probably very busy and forgot and we didn't mention anything either.\nWhen we got our of the hot tub and changed, I could hear a staff member on the front desk telephoning a previous customer to address and resolve a complaint. Whilst the staff member dealt with the customer compassionately, I felt it was quite unprofessional to be able to hear such a private conversation, especially when the conversation is about a complaint towards a spa. This didn't really impact our visit, but more just feedback for the staff.\nAfter the hottub, we had our massages. I had a 45 minute back massage with Megan. It was super relaxing and didn't feel rushed at all. Megan's technique was great. I felt like I was floating when I walked out. I couldn't keep my eyes open on the train back and was absolutely exhausted for the rest of the evening - this is a testament to Megan's skill!\nThank you for a lovely day",

The bathrooms and showers were spotless and cleaned to an unbelievable standard, with staff routinely checking to ensure everything was in perfect condition.\n\nWhat made our stay even more special was the kindness and helpfulness of the park rangers. Every single one we met was friendly, welcoming, and eager to assist with any questions we had. On the morning of our departure, my partner had a lovely conversation with one of the female rangers, who was so kind and attentive. She even took on board our suggestion about installing hot ash bins around the campground—a true sign of how much they care about their guests’ feedback.\n\nAnd the scenery? Absolutely stunning! The peaceful forest setting, combined with views of the beautiful lake and surrounding mountains, made this one of the most picturesque campsites we’ve ever visited.

There are showers and washing up spaces, a cafe that is open during the day and lots of trails for walking and biking. There is  overnight security which was nice to see. It is within walking distance to Rostrevor so you are never far from civilization.",

Also great tent pitches. Shower block is clean with plenty of hot water. Utility area great for dish washing. No laundry facilities. The location is absolutely amazing with plenty of walking, hiking and cycling. A parkrun takes place here every Saturday morning. Town centre is only 5mins walk with plenty of bars and restaurants and grocery stores. There is also a really good cafe onsite which is great for breakfast and lunch if you don't feel like cooking.  If I had to give a negative, the only thing I would say is that it would be nice not to have to pay for electricity on the hard standings if it's not required. Surely it can be turned off for individual pitches 🤔. That being said, I have already booked to go back and have still awarded 5 stars.",

Just 2 mins up the road is a spot to do some rock pool swimming (recommended by Caroline our host). Caroline and Desy were so welcoming and lovely. They were there if we needed them , which we didn't as everything that we needed was there. Clean toilet facilities, plenty of power sockets and some picnic benches to have your morning coffee and snacks.\n\nThe views from the campsite are stunning and because all the campers are nestled in amongst the trees it didn't feel like you were on top of your neighbour.\n\nGood value for money too at £30 per night for a 4-man tent. Would highly recommend this campsite in an absolutely beautiful area near the Mourne Mountains. :-)",

The park’s location is superb — just a short stroll from the town, making it incredibly convenient for grabbing groceries, dining out, or exploring local attractions.\n\nThe facilities on-site are well-suited for families. Our kids had a blast in the swimming pool and arcades, which provided hours of entertainment no matter the weather. The atmosphere felt warm and community-driven, with many families clearly enjoying their time there.\n\nThe only reason we’ve rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the steadily increasing site fees. Even as guests using a family member’s caravan, we were aware of how much more expensive it’s become year after year. While the quality of the park is strong, the rising costs may deter long-term visitors or repeat guests.\n\nIn short: if you're looking for a convenient, family-oriented park with good facilities, Causeway Coast Caravan Park is a great choice—just be mindful of the growing site fees.",
